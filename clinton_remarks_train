[["clinton", " b senator clinton   b hello  and welcome back  those of you who logged on last night  and welcome to those of you who are joining us for the first time tonight  i thought last night's questions were really interesting  and i'm looking forward to the ones that you have asked me for this evening  and tonight we're having this conversation just hours before the president's state of the union address  so i think there's a lot to talk about  so let's get started  crystal patterson  our campaign blogger  is here with me again  so  crystal  what's tonight's first question   b crystal patterson b  first question comes from kathy in new briton  connecticut  she says  i watched you last night and thought you did great  my question is how would you help our reserves who get hurt  i understand  because they're reserves  they don't get the same pay or medical help   b senator clinton   b kathy  thank you so much for raising this  this is an issue i've been working on for the last   years  and you're right  there used to be a big disparity between the active duty military and the national guard and reserve members  they were not given the same access toward health care and credit toward retirement  and we've begun to change that  i teamed up with one of my republican colleagues  senator lindsey graham from south carolina  and we started with legislation to make sure our guard and reserve members and their families had access to health insurance  not just when they were deployed or activated  but all the time  because what we found is that a lot of them were self employed or worked for small employers who didn't provide health care  and just like in the civilian world  they didn't have health insurance for themselves and their families  so we are beginning to rectify that  we still have some work to do  but at least we've made some progress  it's been one of the most heartbreaking experiences for me to travel around new york and talk to our reservists and our guard members and hear about how difficult it was for them to make sure their children have health insurance  and here they were serving our country  i think we're making progress  but keep our feet to the fire because we have a lot more work to do   b crystal patterson b  our next question is from susan in greensboro  north carolina  susan says  i keep hearing that the u s  economy is good  please  how can that be when we owe trillions of dollars to foreign countries  don't you think we need a reality check   b senator clinton   b that's a great comment  susan  yes  i do think we need a reality check  you know  the reality is that  when this president came into office  we had a balanced budget and a surplus  and we were positioned with those funds to be able to deal with some of the problems that we face as a nation  you know  we do have to make sure that social security is there in the future  we've got to provide funding for medicare so that we take care of our seniors  a lot of other investments and opportunities that we were poised to take care of  well  that's all gone  as you know  and we now are in a series of very large deficits  our debt is growing  and the problem that you point out is we owe a lot of money to foreign lenders  now  what does that mean  well  it means that  in order to pay the interest on our debt  we have to entice foreign banks and foreign investors to buy our debt instruments  and that's how we keep our government going  and who are some of the people we owe the most money to  well  like the government of china  and lots of times people ask me as i travel around new york  you know  why can't we get tougher on china to make sure they live up to trade agreements  and i say  you know  i wish we were getting tough because there's a lot to be concerned about  but i think this administration can't figure out how to get tough on its banker  and  in fact  that is what we have created is a situation where we're now this very large debtor nation  and that is going to undermine our competitiveness  it undermines our strategic leadership in the world  so there is a lot to be concerned about  i'm hoping that  in this new democratic congress  we start moving back toward fiscal responsibility  we are certainly going to be trying to tighten the budget rules that worked so well in the  s  you know  you can't do spending or even tax cuts unless you can figure out how to pay for them  that's what worked for us in the ' s  we need to get back to it  but we also have to be sensitive to the fact that there's a lot of problems that we've left untended in the last years that we're also going to have to address like health care  like energy investments and climate change  so we have to strike the right balance   b crystal patterson   b  our next question is from peg in corning  new york  tonight the president will give his state of the union speech  what are your thoughts leading up to this  and is there anything specifically that you're listening for   b senator clinton   b you know  the state of the union is a time for the president to come and report to congress and the people  i think that we need to make our union stronger than it is right now  i'm sure the president will put the best face on it from his perspective  but if we're honest  we know that we are facing very dangerous and difficult situations in iraq and with iran and north korea and  you know  the terrible problems in darfur and disease and so many difficulties that we have to confront  and here at home i know very well that  in places like corning  new york  where there are a lot of wonderful  hard working people  it is a more difficult task to have a middle class lifestyle and afford health care and education and all the other costs  so i think the president has his work cut out for him  now  i will be listening for any overture that he makes to the democratic congress because i believe in getting things done  you know  i worked very hard in corning  for example  you know  with a wonderful new york company called corning to solve some problems and create new opportunities for that great company  so i don't really care where the good ideas come from  i just want to roll up our sleeves and get to work  i hear the president's going to talk about health care  which i'm very happy to hear although  from what i hear about his proposals  i can't say i support those  but the very fact that he's talking about how we can get the universal health care coverage perhaps gives us an opportunity to work together  similarly  he's going to be talking about energy  again  i don't think he'll go far enough  i don't think he'll have the kind of proposal that i believe will move us toward energy independence  but  again  opening the door  maybe inviting the democrats to work with him  moving away from the very divisive partisanship that he and the former republican congress displayed is a good sign because we have a lot of work to do here in america  and i hope tonight we have an invitation for all of us to work together   b crystal patterson   b  our next question is from laura in chicago  illinois  she says  we are a middle class family with two great kids with parents that work very hard  sacrifice as much as they can and volunteer to help the school community as much as possible  despite our best efforts  we can't afford health care  the only place we can afford a home is in a drug and gang infested neighborhood  and we can't save a penny for the future  what would you do to help young middle class families like ours to have a better prospect for the future   b senator clinton   b well  you have really summed up the problem that is not just confronting young middle class families  but so many of our families  and i applaud you for working as hard as you can and having your family stay tight together with your parents and your kids  but i really sympathize because it is harder to maintain the quality of life and the standard of living that we should take for granted in america  so you need help from your government  and i don't think that should be  you know  something that people turn their noses up at  because i know that  you know  when my father got back from world war ii  our country did a lot to get us up and going  and we had great schools and road programs that connected up our country  and we had a wonderful commitment about how we were going to plan for the future and have a better life  well  that's what we need to get back to  i think we need to renew the promise of america for families like yours  so what does that mean  it means we tackle health care costs  we've got to get them down  and we have to provide quality affordable health care  on sunday i put forward a proposal that would insure every child  i want to go to the point  where if you're a family of four making several thousand dollars a year  you'll be eligible for the family health care program  i want to make health insurance affordable for everyone  we have to give you planning for the education of your children  we have to make it easier for you and your husband to save  i have some proposals about how we can do that  with your parents  i assume they're still working  as you said in your question  well  let's make sure that they can save for retirement  that they are able to be as independent as possible  we've had the retirement system really ripped out from under americans  you know  the kind of defined benefit pensions that previous generations counted on are really a vanishing breed  the defined contribution  we have to make it easier for people to invest  and we have to put  you know  more information into the marketplace so people can make good decisions and plan for the future  we also need to be sure that we start to tackle energy costs  you know  it's something that is not going to go away  and we have to help families by giving them better tools to conserve and be more efficient and make better choices in the marketplace  there is really a lot that can be done at the governmental level  but i want to add another factor here  for a lot of our hard working families  i think they feel kind of let down  even betrayed by their employers  you know  there's not that sense that we're all in this together  and too many of our corporate leaders are not really sharing the wealth with their employers  productivity is up  that means americans are working harder  we actually work harder than people anywhere in the world on average  and profits are up for our companies  but where are the wage increases  where are the you know  the benefits that should accrue to hard working americans  so i would really like to call on corporate leadership to do more  and i want to support in every way i can the union movement in our country because a strong union movement has really been part of the american dream and one of the pillars of the american middle class  we're going to try in this democratic congress to make it easier for people who want to join unions to do so  we're going to try to make it easier to bargain  we've got to get back to a balance of power  all of the power is on one side of the economic equation  namely with the employers  and employees can't really  you know  get their fair share of the wonderful wealth and benefits that are being created for people at the higher end of the income spectrum  you know  that doesn't work for america because  with all due respect  america was not built and become a great country because we have rich people  you can find rich people anywhere in the world  we're a great country because of families like yours  and i hope that we're going to get back to more of a balance and provide some of those building blocks again that will give you and your family a leg up on a better future   b crystal patterson   b  our next question is from tom in roanoke  if elected president  would you make the fda into a true champion of good for the people instead of just a lackey for the enormous drug companies   b senator clinton   b well  i'm really glad you asked that because i have been fighting to  you know  reassert the independence and the scientific standing of the fda  you know  the fda  still  despite all of its problems  remains the gold standard for all the drug and food safety in the world  but you obviously have followed this  and you know that what has happened in the last six years is the politicization of the fda  i had a real struggle with them over something called plan b  which is the morning after pill for contraception  and because of ideology  this administration didn't want the fda to make its judgment about this particular drug based on its safety and its effectiveness  so i and my colleague  senator patty murray from washington  we waged a battle saying  we're not going to tell you how to decide  we want you to decide based on the best evidence and follow the weight of science  so what i'm hoping is that we will be able to reassert the independence and the integrity of the fda  we also have to buttress the fda's ability to not just approve drugs  but to follow what happens with those drugs  to do the kind of after approval testing  we need more comparative effectiveness  something that i have been advocating and passed an amendment to the medicare prescription drug benefit  let's compare drugs  and so we know that consumer  the clinician  whether these drugs are good  whether they really make a difference  and  finally  you know  the fda is responsible for a lot of our food supply  but they don't have the personnel and resources necessary  and we've had some really tragic situations in the last couple of years where e  coli has killed people and been traced to our vegetables  our produce  the fda is responsible for that part of our food supply  i think we should have one agency responsible for food safety  but until we can get to that kind of gold standard  let's increase the resources going to the fda  and let's put it back into the business of science and not ideology dictated from political leaders  that's my goal   b crystal patterson b  pierre from georgia asks  what will you do to restore confidence and the integrity in our voting system   b senator clinton b  oh  pierre  this is a passion of mine  i've introduced a very comprehensive bill called the count every vote act because  unfortunately  we have discovered ever since our   election  we have lots of problems with the integrity of our voting system  many of you know the problems we've got with the electronic voting machines  and we've got to have better standards and make sure that we're not engaged in buying machines that have owners and companies with conflicts of interest  we've got to have better protection and safety against hacking or any kind of interference with these machines  there are other problems as well  we  unfortunately  have seen a history of intimidation  people being called and told that they shouldn't vote  or they are being told to vote on a different day than the actual election  or having a flier when they come out of church which says  if you've ever had a parking ticket  you're not eligible to vote  i mean  horrible kinds of interference and destruction of the most important constitutional right that a citizen has  the franchise to exercise his or her voice  there's a lot that i want to do to improve the voting system  and maybe now that we have a democratic congress  we will tackle this  i know that that is on the minds of a lot of my colleagues  and it is something i hear about everywhere  people are constantly asking me  what can we do to get the voting system to once again have integrity  to earn the confidence of the people  you know  we're supposed to be the model of democracy to countries around the world  we cannot afford to have a voting system that is a laughingstock and where people  you know  basically don't believe in it anymore  that would be the beginning of the end for the trust that is needed in a democracy like ours  so i'm going to keep that on the very top of my priority list and work with my fellow democrats to try to make some of the changes we need   b crystal patterson b  our next question is from dave in detroit  the last few presidents publicly showed their leisure time activities  such as fishing  jogging  swimming  tennis  et cetera  are you an active exerciser or family sport participant   b senator clinton   b well  dave  i love to take long walks  i'm a  you know  great walker and hiker  i'm a pretty poor jogger  to be just really honest with you  i run like a tortoise  but i love to get outdoors  and i love taking brisk walks  my husband and i do that all around where we live in new york  i also do work out  not as often or as faithfully as i should  but i try to  and i love swimming  whenever i get a chance  any kind of water  whether it's the ocean  a lake  a pool  i really love being in the out of doors  and  you know  for me  i don't get enough time in the job that i have now to be  you know  outside in nature  but there's nothing i like better than going to one of the beautiful parks and preserves that we have near where we live  we take our dog seamus  our labrador  who  for those of you who followed our first dog in the white house  buddy  who tragically died in a road accident  seamus is buddy's great nephew  and we go for long walks and have a wonderful time just being outside in all sorts of weather  that's where i feel very much at peace  occasionally  i'll ride a bike  i used to do that much more when i was in the white house  i used to take a bike and go down to the pathway along the canal here in washington and ride  you know  a long way  turn around and come back  i found it very restful  i don't get to do that quite as much as i'd like to  but those are the things that i love to do outdoors   b crystal patterson b  lucinda from ft  myers  florida  asks  what are your thoughts on bringing our troops home from iraq  and what should be our exit strategy  are you going to vote for additional funds to support this war   b senator clinton   b well  lucinda  i'm against the president's escalation  i do not believe this is the right strategy  for more than a year and a half  i have advocated something quite different  i've said  look  we need to start redeploying our troops out of harm's way  we need to put pressure on the iraqi government to stand up for itself  to provide its own security  and one of the ways it has to do that is by tackling the political and economic problems in the country  they have not been willing to step up and do that  and i would like to see our government put more pressure on the iraqi government so that they would begin to do so  i don't see that as a part of this plan  the president makes some vague references to having benchmarks for the iraqi government  but he doesn't share them with the congress  we don't know what he's going to try to expect the iraqi government to do  and  thirdly  i would very much like to see the international community involved in this  that's what the iraq study group recommended  i think it's inevitable  and i don't understand why this white house won't engage with the neighbors in the region  including people that  you know  are obviously not friends of ours  like iran and syria  but i know that we've had examples where this has worked in the past  we had an armed services committee hearing earlier today to have general petraeus  who the president has chosen to lead this new strategy  he's a wonderful man  a great soldier  and i think a number of us on the committee told us we have great confidence in him  we just don't have confidence in this strategy  we want to protect our troops  we want to keep giving them the resources they need because they still don't have the armored vehicles that they are in need of  to protect themselves from these horrible bombs and improvised explosive devices that they are constantly in danger of  so we are absolutely united across the party divide to support our troops  and if the president is going forward with this strategy  as he appears to be doing  then we want to make sure we protect our young men and women  but it's the wrong strategy  and we wish he would reverse course and do what many of us would believe would have a better chance of requiring the iraqi government to do its part  you know  making sure that the people in the region had an obligation that they had to fulfill to try to make iraq more secure and stable  and begin  you know  moving our troops out of harm's way  that's what i would like to see him do instead of this escalation strategy he's following   b crystal patterson   b  eric from kalamazoo  michigan  says  although a diehard democrat  i'm often disappointed by the lack of vocal support from party leaders on issues of gay and lesbian civil equality  i realize this is a divisive topic  but i would like to know  if you were made president  would you be comfortable in addressing issues and comfortable support plans  policies or initiatives that advance and protect the civil liberties of gays and lesbians   b senator clinton   b yes  and i feel very strongly about that  we have legislation pending in the congress to do two things  which i support wholeheartedly  one is to end discrimination against gays and lesbians  you know  the enda bill  it's called  has been pending for some time  i'm hoping we can bring it up and perhaps pass it in this democratic congress because  as you may know  or as you personally have experienced  there is still discrimination in the workplace and in other settings in our society  and no matter how anyone might feel about some of these issues  which you have described  i think  as americans  we certainly can be against discrimination against anyone  secondly  i'd like to see the hate crimes legislation to be amended to include any kind of hate crimes on the basis of sexual orientation  which is what the language in the bill currently says  well  i hope we can bring that up as well  again  it's overdue  and  finally  i support civil unions  i think that this is a matter that historically has been left to the states because that's where decisions like these are made  but i have been on record supporting civil unions and equality in relationships  you know  there's so many discriminatory effects that people may not realize  you know  you know so well  not being able to inherit  not being able to own property together in some places  not being able to visit your partner in the hospital  and so much else  well  i think that  again  regardless of how some have tried to politicize these issues in what i think of as a quite mean spirited way  pitting people against their brothers and sisters and neighbors and colleagues  i think that americans are fair minded  and we'll move forward on an agenda of equality   b crystal patterson b  aaron from san diego  california  says  hi  hillary  as a  something blogger  i am so thrilled to see that you will be publishing your own campaign blog on hillaryclinton com  can you tell us how you plan to further your conversation with the american people through your blog   b senator clinton b  well  i'm delighted that you asked about this because we are determined to have as broad a reach as possible to as many people as we can touch through our blog  through web chats like this  through our web site  but i'm going to turn to the expert here because crystal's been working very hard  haven't you  i think she's getting a little sheepish looking here  but  crystal  i think it would be appropriate for you to perhaps explain what we're trying to do with our blog   b crystal patterson b  well  i think you put it well  we're just trying to continue the conversation with you and hopefully give people insight  as you're traveling around the country and talking to different people and seeing how they're reacting to you and  you know  what you have to say  our blog is hopefully going to be a larger community of supporters who all want to see you go on to bigger and better things and generate some excitement  i think it's going to be a really fun place for people to kind of express themselves  right now our biggest push is we're inviting people to put a blog post in to be our first guest blogger on the site  so we encourage everybody to go ahead and submit a blog post and let us know what you think  the conversation has started   b senator clinton   b well  you've heard it from someone with a lot more experience than i have  and i'm just thrilled to have crystal on board  and i hope those of you who are blogging out there  that you'll post a submission for our guest blogger  that you'll follow what crystal and others are doing and let us hear from you  because  as i said in the very beginning  i want to have a conversation  and i want to choose as many different ways of having that conversation  and you can't have a conversation in america today if you don't utilize the web and involve as many people as possible  so i'm excited about what we're going to be doing   b crystal patterson   b  yeah  it's going to be great  our next question is from richie in white plains  how did you start your political career   b senator clinton b  well  richie  let me think  are we going all the way back to grade school  i don't know  you know  you know  i really didn't have an electoral political career until i ran for the senate  richie is from a town  a city  a wonderful city near where i live  and i didn't run for office myself except in school until i ran for the senate  but i've always been involved in politics  in supporting other people who ran for office  in working on behalf of causes that i cared about  and i would urge others to do that because there's  you know  maybe a problem right where you live in white plains that you care about  i know young people who are working to clean up environmental problems where they live  who are working to help the homeless  who are organizing on behalf of the genocide in darfur  who are actively involved in trying to work on hiv aids and other diseases  global climate change  there's so many ways to be involved in issues as a means of becoming involved in politics because  ultimately  we have to change our governmental decisions to affect a lot of these issues  global climate change is a great example  you can care about it  you can talk about it  you can read about it  but if you make it a political issue  then perhaps we can start doing something about it in our country  and so i hope that you will take a look at all the different ways to be involved  and certainly working on a campaign  i'd love to have you work on mine  but there are a lot of other people in the area where you live who have campaigns  they are involved in actively organizing around issues  and if you look for an opportunity to do that  i think you'll find that it can be quite rewarding and fun  so i hope you do get involved   b crystal patterson   b  melissa from martinez  georgia  has our last question for this evening  with the rising cost of health insurance  where do you stand in helping making sure all americans have health insurance  like large employers get large discounts to help provide coverage to their employees  wouldn't the u s  get a big discount for purchasing insurance by the millions to cover all u s  citizens   b senator clinton b  well  that's a very smart point because it's true  there is one huge purchasing pool that is known as the federal employees health benefit plan  and if you're a federal employee  you have choices among all different kinds of insurance policies  and the rates are good because the federal government bargains for better rates  if you are a veteran who gets health care at the va  the va gets to bargain to get prescription drug costs down  we're trying to get that same opportunity to negotiate in the medicare prescription drug program  because the point you make is absolutely right  you know  large employers  you know  bargain with pharmaceutical companies  with insurance companies in order to get the costs down because they buy in bulk  it's like when you go to a discount store  you buy in bulk  you're going to get a lower price  well  we have a huge health insurance market in america  we've got to figure out how to use that market power  and it's especially important because we pay the highest cost for health care in the entire world  and yet we do a lot of the innovation and funding for advances in medical research from the federal government  so it's kind of ironic that we're paying for better health care but americans don't get the benefit of the really lower prices that should flow to those of us who have actually paid for it  so it doesn't really add up or make sense  so i'm going to be coming forward with proposals in the weeks and months ahead  yes  i'm taking on health care again because i think that it's one of the most important issues facing us  and i hear too many stories about too many people who cannot afford health care  and we're going to do everything we can to at least advocate for a system that i would like to see implemented when i become president about trying to provide quality  affordable health care and save money for families  for businesses  and for our country in doing that  well  i can't believe how fast it's gone by again  crystal  i mean  really  and thanks to all of you for logging on again tonight  and i look forward to seeing you again tomorrow  same time  same place    p m  so that we all can keep the conversation going  thanks again for joining me "], ["clinton", " b hillary clinton b  hello and welcome back  we have a lot to talk about tonight because last night was the president's state of the union address  and i know we have been getting a lot of questions about that  in fact  we've gotten tens of thousands of questions in the last few nights  and i have really been impressed by how serious people are about the future of our country  so let's have that conversation again tonight and let's get started  once again  crystal patterson  our campaign blogger  is here with me  so  crystal  what's tonight's first question   b crystal patterson b  our first question tonight is from patricia in york  pennsylvania  she asks  there was no mention of the katrina disaster in the state of the union  did that strike you as odd  isn't that a large part of the union   b hillary clinton b  well  patricia  that did strike me as odd  i know from talking from my friends and colleagues from the gulf coast  particularly new orleans  that the promises the president made are just not being kept  they are more empty promises  it is so heart breaking because this is a part of our union  these are our fellow citizens and we need a much more serious effort  so i'm hoping that with the democratic congress  we will be able to push things along  that we'll be able to try to sort out some of the continuous bureaucratic snafus that have presented people from getting what they needed and making decisions about their futures  there are thousands of people who are still displaced from their homes in southern louisiana and even along the mississippi coast  well  let's figure out what we're going to do to try to help those people  this was one of the worst blots on president bush's record  it was disgraceful the way they were so inattentive and different  it has been equally disgraceful how incompetent and really inadequate their response has been  so i'm going to continue to talk about katrina  i'm going to continue to work with my colleagues from the region as well as others of us that are concerned about this to see if we can't make some progress now that we have a democratic majority   b crystal patterson b  our next question comes from alexander in palm springs  california  after hearing the state of the union address last night  do you agree or disagree with president bush's plan for medical insurance for the people of this country  if you disagree  what would you do differently   b hillary clinton b  alexander  we didn't get a lot of details last night  it was a couple of lines in a nearly hour long speech  so i'm trying to make sure that i understand exactly what the president is proposing  and what i worry about is that the president's plan wants to cap the deduction that you get for the cost of health care and essentially use that to try to help uninsured people get some tax benefits to go out into the marketplace and buy health insurance  there is no real market yet  this would require that we would have to tell insurance companies they would have to insure people  even with preexisting conditions  which they don't want to do  that they would have to keep their cost down in order for a lot of the people who are insured and people who are just above that line to be able to afford it  so i'm going to be focusing on a more comprehensive approach because the other problem that i have with the president's plan is the way he would help to pay for this is by cutting federal funding for public hospitals and community health centers  that is really a false choice in my book  we shouldn't be cutting the money that goes to actually give people health care to get them into the insurance market  i will be proposing in the next weeks or so my own plan about how we get to universal coverage  i'm pleased  however  let me add that the president was willing to talk about health care and come forward with a proposal  i have told members of his administration that's a good sign and we need to figure out how we can work together to try to make progress  but at the end of the day  we're going to have a much more comprehensive approach if we are going to tackle the problems of coverage so that everybody is insured  quality so what you are insured for is good quality care  cost because  it's way too expensive in america compared to the rest of the world and we don't even have the highest quality health care compared to the rest of the world  and competitiveness  we are losing jobs because of the health care costs that are imposed on our businesses  so i have got a lot of ideas  stay tuned  we'll talk about that later   b crystal patterson b  we are going to take a break from the live questions to respond to steve clemons who posted the following on the huffington post blog  would you be the kind of president who gave your staff license to challenge you  to force consideration of every last policy action  to put bad news before good news  or do you like your team to validate your views and not challenge you   b hillary clinton b  steve  i think you can ask anybody who works for me that i like people who challenge me  i like people with expertise and experience and strong opinions  now  i may push back because i also have my opinions  but i want that kind of give and take and debate  i don't think any one person   and certainly no president in these difficult and complex times   have all the answers  and i don't think you find answers from an ideological starting point  i believe in looking at the facts and the evidence  trying to understand what you're trying to achieve in terms of the values that you have and the objectives that you're setting forth in order to get results  what we've seen in the last six years is exactly the opposite  it is as though there is a little echo chamber where everybody is saying the same thing where the president  from what we've been told  is rarely challenged or confronted  that is not the kind of office that i run today  that is certainly not the kind of white house that i would want  another thing  i would like to get a broad cross section of people  i don't want people who already agree with me  i want honest  experienced  hard working patriotic people who want to be part of a team  the american team  in order to understand what we have to do to meet the challenges of today  so i hope that if you ever run across anybody who works for me  you will probably hear that i have got high standards because there is a lot at stake  i want people to work to the best of their ability and i want them to be part of a team  even if the other members of the team disagree  i think through that process you can come to better conclusions  and i'm always open to new evidence  new ways of looking at things  asking those hard questions about the direction we're headed  i think it leads to better decision making  and sometimes it is a little messy because you're trying to get to a point after hearing all sides and you want to keep searching for the very best outcome  the consensus that's going to stand the test  but that  to me  is a better way of making decisions than this kind of top down  intimidatory style where you have to tell them what they want to hear  that's been a disaster and i certainly hope we can get beyond that   b crystal patterson b  our next question is from alice in cornelius  north carolina  what are your plans and proposals for domestic homeland security  would you approve a budget that would aid in security services such as the fbi and cia to carry out specific duties in fighting terrorism   b hillary clinton b  alice  this has been a principal concern ever since   as a senator representing new york on that horrible  horrible day  i saw firsthand and i still deal with the consequences today of our lack of preparedness  our failure to communicate adequately of the stress we were facing  i have very strong feelings about this  i introduced some of the very first legislation after   that would try to get money to our law enforcement agencies  to our intelligence agencies  but equally important  getting it to our local communities  they are the first line of defense with our local fire departments and our police departments and our paramedics and our health departments and so many others that are working diligently to try to be prepared in the case of a natural disaster like katrina which we were just discussing or a terrorist attack  so from my perspective  we need to do many things simultaneously  we need to beef up our homeland security funds so we protect our border  we protect our ports  our mass transit systems  we have done better with airline passengers since   airline cargo  we still have work to do  our vital infrastructure like bridges and tunnels  some of our landmark buildings  we have got to have the very best security  it's not just for the public sector  the private sector has to be involved  they own a lot of our buildings  they are landlords for buildings  they run our big malls and our sports stadium  this has to be a partnership  recently we got the administration to set standards for the chemical industry  we have so many chemical plants in our country that could be disasters if they were ever attacked and there were explosions  that could affect literally millions of people in certain highly congested areas  we have to do a better job of sharing information among levels of government  the federal  state and local governments  we have to get all of our federal agencies working together  the homeland security  fbi  the cia  counterterrorism centers  all of that has to be much more streamlined and focused so that the police on the beat in the car who stops somebody that may be suspicious  may be somebody that the fbi is looking for  they will have that information  they will be able to immediately respond  so we have a lot of work to do  we have made progress since   but  you know  the   commission which did such a great job in analyzing what happened on   came out with a report card last year and basically gave our federal government a d  that's not a very good grade  it may not be a failing grade  but i sure wouldn't want to bring it home to my mother  we have to do a better job in trying to work together  get the money to follow the threat which is what the   commission recommended  and then make sure that all levels of government and the public and the private sector are working together   b crystal patterson b  our next question is from judy in seymour  connecticut  i am a  year old widow of   years struggling to get by on social security  i know there are many widows in my situation  if you were elected president  do you have any interest in this large population of americans  and if so  what will you do to help   b hillary clinton b  judy  i have a lot of interest  my  year old mother lives with bill and me  and i have many friends who are retired who are widowed or divorced  but are alone  they are living on either social security and a small pension  their own  or maybe a late husband's or their ex husband's  so i am very concerned about this because as you know so well there are so many older women who are living alone and it is great that they're healthy enough  independent enough  but as you get older  you have  you know  some challenges  and certainly my highest priority is to protect social security  i consider it a solemn generational promise  and i was adamantly opposed to the president's plan to privatize social security because the very people it would have hurt the most are older women  i worried any move to undermine the guarantee of social security would throw a lot of women who are only above the poverty level today because of social security  i'm going to continue to do everything i can to strengthen social security  there are some fixes we will probably have to make in order for the whole system to keep operating and i'm going to  you know  be open to doing that  but i will never support privatizing this basic guarantee of financial security in our older years  i will also work to find different ways of adding to the savings that widows and single women have in their later years because social security is not enough and even social security with a small pension is sometimes difficult to get by on  so i will certainly be attentive and sensitive to these concerns  you know  as a woman myself who has a lot of friends  either already in your position or very close to it  i consider it a very important part of my responsibility to do everything i can to make sure that you get the help and support you deserve to have   b crystal patterson b  virginia from jensen beach  florida asks  what will you do to ensure increased health care for our military personnel returning from iraq  afghanistan and the middle east as well as health care for the lifetime career veterans facing overcrowded facilities and long wait times for their appointments   b hillary clinton b  boy  i am glad you asked that question because you may have noticed in the state of the union last night that we didn't hear a single word about veterans  we heard a lot about our currently serving young men and women who we are so proud of and so grateful to  but  eventually  they will become veterans  and when they return home  they should be guaranteed access to the highest quality health care through the va  and unfortunately  we've had to fight with the bush administration every year to fund the va  i believe that we should have guaranteed funding for the va  we shouldn't have to fight it out every single year in the appropriations process that goes on in congress to decide how we are going to spend the money in the budget  and the va has made a lot of improvements over the last ten or so years  i'm very proud of the changes that were made in the clinton administration  moving toward information technology so we don't duplicate and lose the medical records and the test results  i am very proud of the power that was given to the va when bill was president to allow the va to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices  as your question implies  there are still long  long lines  waiting periods  we just haven't put together the services that are needed to take care of our returning vets  and  unfortunately  as you probably know  we're going to have so many young men and women with serious conditions going forward  you know  the battlefield is a  degree    situation now  and many people are able to survive wounds that would have killed them in the first gulf war and certainly vietnam or world war ii  what that means is that we have a lot of seriously injured young people with amputated limbs  with traumatic brain injury  with spinal cord injuries  and we owe them everything  i will be a very strong advocate for our veterans and not just in showing up at veterans' gatherings and making a patriotic speech but in fighting for veterans  in fighting for their health care  in fighting for the va  in fighting for fair treatment for vets  we have an all volunteer military now  so to a great extent our military is composed of young men and women to really want to make a commitment to our country  we're so proud of them and grateful to them  but let's show it by taking care of them  let's not just give lip service to their needs  let's make sure that the va is fully funded to meet the ongoing physical and mental health needs of our veterans   b crystal patterson b  our next question is from jamie in illinois  hiv aids in the usa  what will you do and make sure americans are cared for   b hillary clinton b  this is an issue for me for a long time  especially as a senator from new york  we have a very high population of people living with hiv and aids  i believe we need to provide the full range of medical care and support services for people who are afflicted with hiv and aids  i have been a strong supporter of the federal programs that fund treatment for people living with hiv and aids  and i will continue to do so  here in our country  the fastest growing group of people that are being infected with the disease are women of color  are women who are poor  they are often being left out of the service system and the programs that are available to treat people with hiv and aids  i want to be sure that everybody has access to the medical care that they need  we are going to have to do some work   excuse me   to get that done  i think it is very important that we recognize that the population is growing in our southern states  and up until now  there hasn't been enough treatment available for people in those states  i had a big fight   you may know if you follow this issue this past year because the ryan white care act is one of the principal vehicles for providing health care to people living with hiv aids  what i really argued against was instead of keeping the money at the same level  the federal government should increase the amount of money available  and they wanted to take money away from my state of new york which still has the highest number of people in order to take care of the people who are suffering in other states  i want to take care of everybody  but why take it away from people who need it to give it to other people who need it  it is one of the reasons why we need a new president and why i am looking forward to being that president  to make sure that we take care of everybody who is afflicted with this disease   b crystal patterson b  brian from new york says  how will you handle the current nuclear crisis in iran and north korea   b hillary clinton b  let me get a glass of water here because i am losing my voice  i have think i have done too much talking in the several days  we are in a terrible situation because of the way this administration has mishandled both north korea and iran  with respect to north korea  we had a crisis with north korea in   and we were able to prevent them from processing plutonium  that's the fastest  easiest way to get what you need for a nuclear weapon  the north koreans being the north koreans were cheating and they were trying to enrich uranium  they didn't breach the agreement about plutonium but they were cheating on the side trying to enrich uranium which is frankly harder to do  when the bush administration found out they were cheating  they said we are not going to talk to you anymore  we are taking the inspectors out  we are shunning you because you were cheating  that was  like  an open invitation to the north koreans to process plutonium  as we have seen  they have produced some nuclear weapons  i think that was a backwards approach  we should have come down even harder on the north koreans  we should have put even more inspectors in and we should have been very tough in negotiating with them directly  we made the same mistake with iran  instead of negotiating and dealing with iran and figuring out what they were up to and trying to understand who was really calling the shots  this administration's attitude is  we don't talk to bad people  well  i don't know why that's a very sensible policy in their view  but that's their policy  they stopped talking to iran  instead they told the british  germans and the french  you go talk to iran  so that went on for years with no real results and iran is just continuing to push forward  i have advocated direct contact  engagement with both of these regimes  do i agree with what they're doing  of course  not  do i trust them  absolutely not  we dealt with the soviet union all during the cold war when they had thousands missiles pointed at us  we didn't stop talking to them even during the cuban missile crisis  we gained valuable information that enabled us to take steps that led to the demise of the soviet union  i would urge that we do the same thing with iran and north korea  i would like to see the administration begin doing that sooner instead of later   b crystal patterson b  great  okay  our next question comes from new jersey  andrea asks  what do you like to do when you are not working   b hillary clinton b  well  sleeping is a good option  catching up on my sleep  seriously  last night i talked about what i like to do outdoors  i love to walk  i love to hike  i love to bike  i love to swim in appropriate weather  and i love to go to movies  bill and i go to movies as often as we can  we love to go out to dinner with our friends  sometimes just the two of us  there are a lot of favorite little places we enjoy going to  i love to read for pleasure  i just   you know  i just like to chill out and do as little as possible  putter around in my garden which is  you know   i'm not that great a gardener  i try to avoid killing anything i have  but i love being out there and think about what i can ask somebody else to do who has a much greener thumb than me  i love to spend time with my friends  just normal things that give me some real pleasure  sometimes i like to clean my house  clean out my closets because there is a beginning  a middle and an end  and a lot of the work i do  there doesn't ever seen to be an end  you worry about north korea and iran and there is no way to get your arms around it all  kind of normal stuff i like to do  i think  when i am not working   b crystal patterson b  our next question is from jacqueline in wellesley  massachusetts  as a college student concerned for the future of our environment  i was wondering if you had any plans to implement controls on co  emissions and further  how do you plan to address the ever growing crisis of global warming   b hillary clinton b  i see that your message is from wellesley  i don't know if you are a wellesley student or perhaps going to one of the other fine institutions around there or wellesley high school  i spent four wonderful years at wellesley college and really enjoyed myself there  i am glad you are worried about the environment  i think the changes we have to make are going to be driven by young people  we have dropped the ball  this administration has wasted six years  it looks like it will waste mostly the next two years instead of coping with and dealing with the challenge of global climate change  there is a lot we have to do  i want to draw your attention to something i will be involved in  i sit on the environment committee  it is now being chaired by my friend and colleague senator barbara boxer from california  she is absolutely committed as all the democrats are on the committee to trying to get a piece of legislation that we can  perhaps  get majority support for that moves us toward dealing with co  emissions  now  we have a closely divided senate so it won't be easy to do everything that we all think we should do  but we have got to make a start  it is disgraceful that our country is not on record as dealing with global climate change  starting next week in the environment committee  we will start having forums on climate change and global warming  we will be having an open forum with every member of the senate invited to come and state their position so we can try to figure out what's the consensus position  we're also going to be having later that week or next week  i can't remember which  we are going to be having a meeting with people from other countries who have dealt with global climate change  look at what great britain has done  they set very strict standards about trying to get back to the   levels and they're doing very well because they adopted both some carrots and some sticks  they have incentives for energy conservation and efficiency  they are working with polluting power plants  they have a comprehensive program  and the extra added benefit is that it has helped to create thousands of new jobs in great britain because they are dealing with a problem by putting people to work  to actually make a difference  so stay tuned  i think you are going to see some positive action out of the democrats in the senate   b crystal patterson b  okay  our final question for the evening comes from patrick in south dakota  he says  senator clinton  my name is patrick  i live in a small town in south dakota so my wife and i can stay close to our roots  we are recent college graduates and worked hard in college and continue to do so as graduates  we are finding the contrast our society lives in now  that is  getting an education equals success  what it should say is getting an education equals debt with high interest rates and the inability to buy a home  start a family and live a good life  with the rising cost of health care  interest rates on student loans  rising housing market and not being compensated for our education  what would you say to the youth of america to stay focused and go to school   b hillary clinton b  well  i think that is the message  that i understand completely the problems that you have just outlined  but we have to continue to educate our people in order to be competitive globally  and i would hope that we can give you some relief from some of these rising costs  it is incredibly damaging to someone's prospects for the future or the choices they can make in their life  if they are totally focused on having to pay back their debt  so i want to get the cost of education down  i want to get the interest rates on loans down  i want to give more forgiveness for debt for people who go into areas of shortage or need in our society  like math and science teachers or engineers  we have a lot of work that needs to be done in america and we aren't going to be successful if we make it so difficult for our young people to afford to go to college  stay in college and complete college  so i hope that in the next few years   and this is one of the issues i am going to be running on for president   i hope that we can get back to paging college affordable again  that we don't load people down with debt  that we can deal with the rising health care costs in a sensible way and that we can also  you know  try to close that gap between the very well off and everybody else because that's not good for america either  but i guess i would underscore the importance of an education  despite the difficulties and the challenges  i really wish you and your wife well  you are exactly the kind of young people that build communities and being close to your roots  you know how important it is to really keep your family going and make something of yourself  and i wish you well  just as i do everybody who is watching tonight  i have to thank all of you for logging on tonight and for the last two nights  it has really gone by way too fast  i have enjoyed the conversation  i will be going out around the country  i will be in iowa this weekend  the following weekend i will be in new hampshire  i am going to be having face to face conversations  but i will continue to use this medium as well because i want you to hear directly from me and i want to have your questions  i am so sorry we couldn't answer the tens of thousands of questions that came in  it was really overwhelming  but i want to thank crystal for all of her help  i hope when we launch our blog and crystal starts reporting on the campaign that all of you will log on and share your thoughts with us  meanwhile  i look forward to keeping the conversation going  and i wish all of you the very best  we've got a lot of tough challenges in america but there is nothing we can't handle if we work together  we come up with sensible  practical solutions and we keep our eye on what's important  to renew the promise of america and to restore the greatness and respect for our country at home and abroad  that's what i intend to try to do during this campaign with ideas and with my vision for this country  and then in   to have the chance as your president to do that as well  thank you all and good night "], ["clinton", "mr  president  at this moment of challenge for our nation  the vantage point of this august chamber  we look onto a world filled with danger  deeply complex threats against our troops and our national interests abroad  and genuine risks to our security here at home  keeping our nation strong and our people safe requires that we employ the best and smartest strategies available  in confronting enemies and threats  we are fortunate to possess a great many assets  all of which we must wisely deploy  including our military  diplomatic  economic  and cultural assets  our strongest asset remains the democracy that we are privileged to take part in as members of the senate and as representatives of our constituents  our democratic institutions  under our constitution  balance one another and check against excesses and concentrations of power that help us wrestle with difficult challenges in an open and forthright way  this constitutional framework is not an obstacle to pursuing our national security  but the example that we should project to the world  our democracy  with its tradition of accountable power and open debate  is america at its best  and that's what we need  america at our best  as we deliberately and resolutely confront the threat posed by the iranian regime  now  make no mistake  iran poses a threat to our allies and our interests in the region and beyond  including the united states  the iranian president has held a conference denying the holocaust and has issued bellicose statement after bellicose statement calling for israel and the united states to be wiped off the map  his statements are even more disturbing and urgent when viewed in the context of the regime's request to acquire nuclear weapons  the regime also uses its influence and resources in the region to support terrorist elements that attack israel  hezbollah's attack on israel this summer  using iranian weapons  clearly demonstrates iran's malevolent influence even beyond its borders  we also have evidence  although it is by no means conclusive  of attacks using iranian supplied or manufactured weaponry against our own american soldiers  as i have long said and will continue to say  u s  policy must be clear and unequivocal  we cannot  we should not  we must not permit iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons  and in dealing with this threat  as i've also said for a long time  no option can be taken off the table  but america must proceed deliberately and wisely  and we must proceed as a unified nation  the smartest and strongest policy will be one forged through the institutions of our democracy  that is the genius of our american system and our constitutional duty  we have witnessed these past six years  until the most recent election of a new congress by the american people  the cost of congressional dereliction of its oversight duty  a vital role entrusted to congress by our constituents  enshrined in  and even required by our constitution  so we are here today because the price that has been paid in blood and treasure  through the rush to war in iraq and the incompetence of its execution and managing the aftermath  in the excesses of military contracting abuses and the inadequate supply of body armor and armored vehicles on the ground have led to a loss of confidence among our allies and the american people in this administration  therefore  mr  president  we cannot and we must not allow recent history to repeat itself  we continue to experience the consequences of unchecked presidential action  sunlight is the best disinfectant  but this president was allowed  for too long  to commit blunder after blunder under cover of darkness provided by an allied republican congress  in dealing with the threats posed by the iranian regime  which has gained its expanding influence in iraq and the region as a result of the administration's policies  president bush must not be allowed to act without the authority and oversight of congress  it would be a mistake of historical proportion if the administration thought that the   resolution authorizing force against iraq was a blank check for the use of force against iran without further congressional authorization  nor should the president think that the   resolution authorizing force after the terrorist attacks of   in any way  authorizes force against iran  if the administration believes that any  any use of force against iran is necessary  the president must come to congress to seek that authority  i am deeply concerned by the recent statements coming out of the bush administration  the administration has asserted evidence that the iranian regime's complicity  at the highest levels  for attacks within iraq  yet at the same time  general peter pace  chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  questions these as assertions  in particular  the capability and intentions of the iranian government  in this delicate situation  while making disturbing comments   there are reports that the administration  is sending a third aircraft carrier to the gulf  the president owes an on going consultation to this congress and owes straight talk to the country  we have to get this right  the congress should debate our current course  including the current silent treatment policy toward our adversaries  i believe we can better understand how to deal with an adversary such as iran if we have some direct contact with them  i think that can give us valuable information and better leverage to hold over the iranian regime  and if we ever must  with congressional agreement  take drastic action  we should make clear to the world that we have exhausted every other possibility  i welcome the agreement announced yesterday between the united states and north korea  it demonstrates the central value of using every tool in our arsenal to achieve our objectives  i only wish the administration had pursued this course six years ago when an agreement with north korea was within reach  the wasted time has allowed north korea to develop nuclear weapons in the interim  failure to use diplomacy has damaged our national security interests  the important step forward our country has made with north korea raises the obvious question  why will the president refuse to have any kind of process involving iran as i and others have urged  the united states engaged in talks with north korea within a multilateral process  but also had ongoing bilateral discussions  we should have such a process of direct engagement with iran  as recommended by many  including the iraq study group  we need friends and allies to stand with us in this long war against terrorism and extremism  and to contain and alter the regimes that harbor and support those who would harm us  during the cold war  we spoke to the soviet union while thousands of missiles were pointed at our cities  while its leaders threatened to bury us  while the regime sewed discord and military uprisings and actions against us and our allies  that was a smart strategy used by republican and democratic presidents alike  even though it was often a difficult one  as we discuss potential evidence of iranian complicity in supplying arms to insurgents  along with the refusal to suspend their nuclear ambitions  we need to deliver a strong message to iran that we will not stand by and tolerate this behavior  however  we need to deliver that message forcefully through direct talks  the lives of american soldiers are at risk and we should not outsource our discussions with the iranians on this and other issues  when i say no option should be taken off the table  i include diplomacy  currently  our intelligence on iran is of uncertain quality  we need to examine the facts closely and carefully  no action can or should be taken without explicit congressional authorization  and knowing what we know now  this body needs a steady stream of real  verifiable intelligence  we  in the congress  cannot do our part in deciding what needs to be done if we do not know what is happening  and it does not appear that the administration has any real grasp on the facts on the ground  even after all these years  the public unclassified sections of the nie report recently issued  made it very clear in their conclusions that sectarian violence would still exist in iraq absent iran  so we have a lot to sort out here  we have all learned lessons from the conflict in iraq  and we have to apply those lessons to any allegations that are being raised about iran  because  mr  president  what we are hearing has too familiar a ring and we must be on guard that we never again make decisions on the basis of intelligence that turns out to be faulty  if we find evidence of potential iranian complicity  we will take appropriate action  but that requires a partnership to defend and protect america's national security interests between the congress and the president  oversight will also lead to a consensus approach that brings together the best judgments and strategies of our nation and will examine the consequences of action  the reality of any perceived or alleged threat  and the consequences of taking action  i sometimes fear that the word  consequence  has been taken out of the vocabulary of this administration  we have to look over the horizon  we have to make hard choices among difficult options  so  mr  president  there are no easy answers to the complex situations we confront in the world today  but if we do face threats  then congressional consultation and authorization will bring the american people into the debate  whatever steps  if any  may be required should be taken by our nation  not just by our president  we must act as americans  not as members of one party or another  our nation has been divided by a failed policy and the relentless pursuit of it  we are facing that again with the escalation policy that the president is pursuing today  mr  president  if we face up to our constitutional responsibilities as the congress  if we conduct the oversight that is required  if we exercise our checks and balances  then we are likely to reach a better conclusion than we have thus far  we must be tough and smart  deliberative and wise  and we must look at all of our assets  not just the brave men and women who wear the uniform of our country to implement the best policy  we should start by employing our best values  the democratic values that give strength to our nation and our cause  and that serve as an example and beacon to people who wish to live in peace and freedom and prosperity around the world  mr  president  i yield the floor "], ["clinton", "thank you  thank you  thank you  this is the day the lord has made  let us rejoice and be glad in it  and i want to begin by giving praise to the almighty for the blessings he has bestowed upon us as a congregation  as a people  and as a nation  and i thank you so much  reverend armstrong  for welcoming me to this historic church  and i thank the first baptist church family for opening your hearts and your home to me and to so many visitors today  i have to confess that i did seek dispensation from reverend armstrong to come because you know  i'm a methodist  and i'm in one of those mixed marriages  and my husband  who sends greetings to all of you today  felt it necessary to call the reverend to make sure that was all right  and thank you  reverend  for being so broad minded and understanding  it is also a great honor to be here with so many distinguished members of the clergy  elected officials  leaders of the civil rights movement  today  tomorrow  and yesterday  president steele  i could have listened all afternoon  that pulse that you found so faint you have brought back to life  and all of us owe you and sclc a great deal of gratitude  i think everybody in the sanctuary has been introduced  but i want to just say a word of recognition to some of my colleagues in government who have traveled a long way to be here with us today  congressman rahm emanuel from illinois and his son zach  congressman anthony weiner from new york  congresswoman gwendolyn moore from wisconsin  congressman linda sanchez from california  and the chair of all the mayors in the country  mayor palmer from trenton  new jersey  i thank them for coming to join with us  and i have to say  chairman chestnut  thank you for the history lesson and for the welcome  i thank all of the board of deacons  the board of trustees and the deaconesses and i appreciate that we are gathered here for another commemoration that is important for us once again to re enact so we never forget  i also want to ask for our prayers on behalf of all those who lost their lives in the terrible tornadoes that swept through this state and others and particularly for those young people  those eight students of enterprise high school who lost their lives  for their families  and on behalf of all those who may still be missing  i come here this morning as a sister in worship  a grateful friend and beneficiary of what happened in selma   years ago  i come to share the memories of a troubled past and a hope for a better tomorrow  one that is worthy of the sacrifices that were made here  today marks that  nd anniversary  but it also marks  as we have heard  the  th anniversary of sclc and the  th anniversary of the integration of central high by the little rock nine  and i have friends with me today from arkansas who have been with my husband and me for all those years  we know  as president steele reminded us  that america's march to freedom  equality and opportunity has been marked by milestones   milestones like the creation of sclc and the integration of central high and that fateful sunday with that march across the pettis bridge  but those are just milestones  they do not mark the end of the journey  in fact  it is not over yet  and i believe that for many people today who are mistaken that bloody sunday is a subject for the history books  it is our responsibility to make it clear to them it is just as relevant today as it was   years ago  yes  that long march to freedom that began here has carried us a mighty long way  but we all know we have to finish the march  that is the call to our generation  to our young people  as a young girl  i had the great privilege of hearing dr  king speak in chicago  the year was   my youth minister from our church took a few of us down on a cold january night to hear someone that we had read about  we had watched on television  we had seen with our own eyes from a distance  this phenomenon known as dr  king  he titled the sermon he gave that night  remaining awake through a great revolution  some of you may have heard it because he delivered it more than once  he described how the literary character rip van winkle had slept through the american revolution  and he called on us  he challenged us that evening to stay awake during the great revolution that the civil rights pioneers were waging on behalf of a more perfect union  it was sweeping our country  and we would sleep through it at our risk and detriment  now  i know we've been at this a long time  and after all the hard work  getting rid of the literacy tests and the poll taxes  fighting for the right to vote  bringing more people into the economic mainstream  a body does get tired  but we've got to stay awake  we've got to stay awake  because we have a march to finish  a march toward one america  that should be all america was meant to be  that too many people before us have given of themselves time and again  to make real  how can we rest while poverty and inequality continue to rise  how can we sleep  while   million of our fellow americans do not have health insurance  how can we be satisfied  when the current economy brings too few jobs and too few wage increases and too much debt  how can we shrug our shoulders and say this is not about me  when too many of our children are ill prepared in school for college and unable to afford it  if they wish to attend  how can we say everything is fine when we have an energy policy whose prices are too high  who make us dependent on foreign governments that do not wish us well  and when we face the real threat of climate change  which is tinkering with god's creation  how do we refuse to march when we have our young men and women in uniform in harm's way  and whether they come back  their government does not take care of them the way they deserve  and how do we say that everything is fine  bloody sunday is for the history books  when over   of our citizens  the victims of hurricane katrina  are still living in trailers and mobile homes  which is a national disgrace to everything we stand for in america  you know  dr  king told us   dr  king told us our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter  well  i'm here to tell you poverty and growing inequality matters  health care matters  the people of the gulf coast and new orleans matter  our soldiers matter  our standing in the world matters  our future matters  and it is up to us to take it back  put it in to our hands  start marching toward a better tomorrow  now    years ago  from this church and from brown  brave men and women first tried to march  two days later  dr  king tried again  getting as far as the bridge  then on the third day  armed with judge frank johnson's order  more than   people crossed the pettis bridge  and by the time they got to montgomery  they were   strong  now  my friends  we must never forget the blows they took  let's never forget the dogs and the horses and the hoses that were turned on them  driving them back  treating them not as human beings  but also don't forget about the dignity with which they bore it all  they understood the right to vote matters  now  five months later the voting rights act was enacted by congress and signed by president johnson  but we all know it was written on the march from selma to montgomery  it was written by men and women with tired feet and swollen ankles  and it was first signed with their blood  sweat  and tears  we cherish the few  including my good friend  congressman john lewis  who still remain with us today  to cross the bridge again  but let us not forget those who have passed on   dr  king and coretta  viola  ralph abernathy  josea williams and all the others  we remember  too  jimmy lee jackson  whose killing near here was one of the events that ignited the march  and we were the support of this great church and of reverend fred  who helped to lead people into justice for all  so many prayed and stood up for the right to vote  dr  king said quality for african americans would also free white americans of the staining legacy of slavery  and so it has  in   my husband said here that those who walked across the bridge made it possible for the south to grow and prosper and for two sons of the south  jimmy carter and bill clinton  to be elected president of the united states  the voting rights act gave more americans from every corner of our nation the chance to live out their dreams  and it is the gift that keeps on giving  today it is giving senator obama the chance to run for president of the united states  and by its logic and spirit  it is giving the same chance to governor bill richardson  an hispanic  and yes  it is giving me that chance  too  you know  this may be interesting for the legislators who are here  but before selma and the voting rights act put quality front and center  it was illegal under alabama law for women to serve on juries  i know where my chance came from  and i am grateful to all of you  who gave it to me  but in the last two presidential elections we have seen the right to vote tampered with  and outright denied to too many of our citizens  especially the poor and people of color  not just in florida  ohio  and maryland  but in state after state  the very idea that in the  st century  african americans would wait in line for   hours while whites in an affluent precinct next to theirs waited in line for   minutes  or that african americans would receive fliers telling them the wrong time and day to exercise their constitutional right to vote  that's wrong  it is simply unconscionable that today young americans are putting their lives at risk to protect democracy half a world away when here at home their precious right to vote is under siege  my friends  we have a march to finish  i will be reintroducing the count every vote act  to ensure that every voter is given the opportunity to vote  that every vote is counted  and each voter is given the chance to verify his or her vote before it is cast and made permanent  we have to stay awake  we have a march to finish  on this floor today  let us say with one voice the words of james cleveland's great freedom hymn   i don't feel no ways tired i come too far from where i started from nobody told me that the road would be easy i don't believe he brought me this far to leave me  and we know   we know   we know  if we finish this march  what awaits us  st  paul told us  in the letter to the galatians   let us not grow weary in doing good  for in due seasons we shall reap  if we do not lose heart  the brave men and women of bloody sunday did not lose heart  we can do no less  we have a march to finish  let us join together and complete that march for freedom  justice  opportunity  and everything america should be  thank you and god bless you "], ["clinton", "you know  it's hard to build the future if you don't start by honoring the past  and march is women's history month  a great time to remember that women's work helped build this country  it's also an important time to make sure that women's work is valued  not just with fine words  but with fair pay  it's been   years since the equal pay law was first passed  and there's been a lot of progress since then  so many barriers have been shattered  the possibilities for my daughter's generation exceed anything my mother could have imagined even when i was growing up  but here we are at the beginning of the  st century and women still earn significantly less money than men for doing the same jobs  women who work full time year round earn just   cents for every dollar that a man makes  and for women of color it's even less  sixty seven cents for african american women for every dollar a man makes  and just   cents for latinas  you know  that's a huge difference every single week  when it comes to paying the rent or the mortgage  or buying groceries or school supplies  or covering the doctor's bills  over a lifetime the numbers really add up  working women stand to lose a quarter of a million dollars over the course of their careers because of unequal pay practices  and this is a problem for women no matter where we work  i read a story recently that wimbledon finally agreed to pay their women tennis champions the same amount of prize money as their male champions  it only took   years for them to do the right thing  so what do we do  well i'm introducing a new bill called the paycheck fairness act to help closed the pay gap for women  first  it offers women meaningful remedies for pay discrimination by toughening the penalties for violating the equal pay act  now that should help stop employers from discriminating against women  second  it makes sure our government enforces equal pay laws in our own federal contracts  millions of women are employed through federal contracts  we should at least be a model to the private sector about giving women an equal paycheck for equal work  third  this bill prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who share salary information  right now when women try to find out if they are being treated fairly by asking around about what others get paid  they can get in trouble or even be fired  this bill would make that illegal  and finally  this bill requires the department of labor to continue collecting and disseminating information about women workers  you wouldn't think you would need a law to do that  but the bush administration has stopped collecting some valuable information about women in the workplace  as with so many things  they seem to think that the problems will go away if they make the facts go away  well  i want to get back into the reality business  with real solutions to the real problems people face  that's why i'm also working to expand family and medical leave to cover sick leave  to increase funding for research into the connection between diseases like breast cancer and environmental hazards  to insure that title ix continues  so that young women can compete  and we also have to make sure that we stay vigilant about protecting a woman's right to choose and smart about making family planning available  i hope you'll join this conversation about these and other important issues  this is women's history month  so let's keep the conversation going about women  about our past  and most definitely  about our future  if history has taught us nothing else  it's that if we work together  we can do anything  thanks for listening "], ["clinton", "america's middle class  and working families  have become the invisible americans  if you are a hard working single parent who can't afford health insurance or a small business owner who worries about energy costs or a student who can't afford to continue college  you are invisible to this administration  you are invisible to the oil companies earning record profits while you pay more at the pump  you are invisible to the companies who outsource your job  or lay you off or end the promise of your pension  for six long years  president bush and the washington republicans have looked right through you  if you are a first responder  worker or volunteer from   in need of medical treatment  you are invisible to them  if you are a soldier returning from combat and waiting for treatment or disability pay  you are invisible  if you are a child sitting in a failing school waiting for the promised federal funding under the no child left behind act  you are invisible  if you are single mom who needs safe quality child care while you go to work  you are invisible  and if you're a career government scientist raising the global warming alarm  a conservationist trying to protect the environment  a government accountant looking into no bid contracts that have cost the tax payers billions of dollars  even a republican u s  attorney trying to enforce the law impartially   they've tried to make you invisible to the rest of us  more than   million people living without health insurance  more than   people living in trailers after hurricane katrina    million children living in poverty  for six long years  they have all been invisible  well  they're not invisible to us  they're not invisible to me  and when we retake the white house  they will no longer be invisible to the president of the united states "], ["clinton", "hello  how are you doing  thank you  thank you all  thanks so much and thanks for last night too  it's an honor and pleasure to be here this morning  it was a lot of fun to be here last night  you know as i look around this room which is packed with people whom i admire so much  i see a lot of old friends  and it's been an honor to stand with you  we've stood together in good times and bad times  we've stood together when it seemed as though the darkness would never end and when we finally saw the light  so it is just a personal honor of the highest degree to be here today  and i want to thank also my friend and your great leader for that wonderful introduction  you know harold and vinny have been the heart and soul of leading this great  great union  and we've been through a lot  but the thing about going through tough times with harold and vinny on your side is that you know that you're not going to be alone  and that has meant the world to those of us from new york  and we have a lot of firefighters from across new york here today and i want to thank you all for everything you do  every single day  when i think about the work that you do and the service and commitment that you have given to your nation  i know that for all of you  courage is a job requirement  you don't make this decision to be a firefighter easily or quickly  you have to think about the sacrifice and you have to think about your families  for you when you go to work  when you go to that fire house or that station these are not just your colleagues  these are members of your extended family  and i recognize how much this family  both the one that you leave at home as you kiss your wife goodbye or you tuck your son into bed are part of the commitment that you've made  and i want to also thank your family members because its not easy to see you walk out the door  to see you leave for that shift and just wait to make sure you've come home safely again  so i want to express my gratitude to your families and to everyone who love you and support you in the work that you do every single day  you know  harold referred to our meeting that we had on the morning of september   on the day before  september   not only our country but the entire world saw for themselves what firefighters are made of  you were the ones who ran into the fire  you were the ones who ran into the dust  into those collapsing buildings  and for you some of your brothers and sisters it was the last time you saw them  but people who were not even on duty dropped everything they were doing to be there that day  people who didn't even work for the fdny but who worked out on long island  who worked in westchester  who worked in connecticut  who worked in new jersey  dropped everything they were doing  and pretty soon teams started coming from around the country  everybody sang we want to be there  we want to watch your back  we want to help search that wreckage to see if we can find anybody still alive  when harold and i spoke it was a time of shock and confusion  harold was kind enough to describe what i said to him but i want to tell you what he said to me  he said   we will stand with new york  firefighters across this country and even across our border to the north will be there for you  well  harold  you were true to your word  not only you  but firefighters and paramedics and others poured into our city  you shared equipment with us  you raised money for us  you worked side by side with us  and you prayed with us  you were there when we needed you  and i want you to know that i will be there with you when you need me  now  we have to put this into a little bit of a context today  because i know many of you including harold and vinny were perhaps a little unsure about me when i started running  now that happens to me sometimes  in fact  you might recall  that back in   you actually endorsed my opponent  but i never saw that as any kind of obstacle to working on behalf of your needs and your interests  just as when i ran for the senate in new york  i said i wanted to be a senator who represented everybody  people who were for me  people who were against  people who didn't have an opinion  and i wanted to find ways we could move a common agenda forward  and of course  a crisis brought us all together  and we rolled up our sleeves  over the years i've made wonderful friends with many of you  i was very proud in my last election to have the support of the new york firefighters  that meant the world to me because without fail  we have to stand together  we have a lot of big problems that we're facing  and i think we can once again reassert america's leadership at home  restore our values  fulfill the promise of america  and get back to leading the world in the right way  now that starts with restoring what i call the basic bargain  so many of us grew up with that  you know  we were raised to believe that if you worked hard and if you played by rules you'd be able to build a better life for yourself and your family  well  i don't think in the last six years our country has actually been living up to that basic bargain  the leadership here in washington seems to ignore middle class and hardworking families across our country  under this president's leadership household debt has soared  healthcare costs have skyrocketed  assuming that you have it  wages have remained stagnant  now corporate profits are up  and productivity is up  which means americans are working harder than anybody in the world  but we're not getting rewarded  i'll tell you who is getting rewarded  companies like halliburton are getting rewarded with no bid contracts  then they move their ceos across the ocean to another country and leave us hanging right here at home  i'll tell you something else that we are going to have to deal with  the alternative minimum tax  which falls heavily on a lot of you and your families  you know  for six i've have been saying  with all due respect  do the billionaires in america need more tax cuts  don't you think we ought to cut the taxes of middle income people  in particular those who are going to be hit by the alternative minimum tax  you know  for six long years  our president has not seen the vast majority of americans  not our middle class  not our working families  he's looked right through them  to him  they're invisible  you know  if you're a child sitting in a crumbling school  you're invisible  if you're a small business owner who worries about energy costs or someone who can't afford to fill up your tank   you're invisible  if you're a hardworking parent who needs affordable childcare while you go to work   you're invisible  even if you're a soldier returning from combat who needs healthcare and disability compensation  you are invisible  well  those days are over  when we look at the way our first responders have been treated  if you're paramedic who got sick after   if you're a federal firefighter who can't qualify for worker's compensation or disability retirement  if you're a retired firefighter who can't afford health insurance  well  you're invisible too  it's great for the photo ops  but how about taking care of the people who taken of us across our country  well i want to make clear today you're not invisible to the people of our country  and you're sure not invisible to me  and when we retake the white house  you will no longer be invisible to the president of the united states of america  and i want to say in this public setting that when i'm in the white house i'm going to be there for you whenever you need me on whatever you need me for  because there isn't anything more important to me than taking care of our first responders  it is part of our national security  it is part of our moral obligation  and being there for you means continuing the fight to ensure that you have everything you need to do your job  the equipment  the people  whatever it takes  so let me tell you when george w  bush tried to cut the funding for the safer act  which i co sponsored  and the fire act  i took that personally  and with my colleagues  we fought him  and when he did it again  we fought him again  and i'm going to keep on fighting until fire and safer are fully funded  whatever it takes  now being there for you also means caring for every firefighter  every police officer  every paramedic  every volunteer or worker who has fallen ill in the aftermath of september   it wasn't just people from new york who responded that day and the days to follow and the months to follow  it was people from all over our country  and when i first visited the site  the afternoon of september the   i could barely see anything  the dark cloud was so thick  but i could smell it  i could taste it  i could feel it  as i watched the first firefighters walking out of that curtain of darkness  covered in black soot  barely able to stand  dragging their axes behind them  i knew that the effects of   would last long after september   within days the so called world trade center cough began to appear  young men and women in the prime of their lives developed asthma and bronchitis and laryngitis  and their livers were polluted and their lungs were failing  and people who  before september   could lift three times their body weight  could barely stand they were so bent over in pain  they couldn't sleep lying flat in their beds anymore  they had to sit up all night long  people who used to be able to run miles without stopping could no longer breathe going up a flight of stairs  working hand in hand with many of you and with the iaff we created a program to screen and monitor those who were sick  and we got   million to expand it  and when president bush tried to take   million back  we knew we had to draw the line  and you once again came in and helped us win that fight  let's just say the president picked a fight with the wrong people  we won it but we didn't stop there  with your help i was able to introduce legislation asking for more than   billion for medical and mental health monitoring and treatment  we're going to keep working on this  not just this year or next year but as long as our first responders  our workers  our volunteers  our residents need help  being there for you also means getting smart about homeland security  as you know all too well  we confront a new enemy and a new kind of warfare  it's really the warfare of cowards  it's people who sneak around and blow themselves up or place bombs in cars  who have a philosophy of nihilism  you know  they may dress it up in a kind of perverse version of religion  but it's really about destruction and death  and it is imperative that we stand against them  their warfare is not conducted by armies or navies but by criminals  by insurgents  by militias driven by this twisted hate  and it's been frustrating for many of us because we can't get the resources to match the rhetoric  we've got a lot of tough rhetoric out of washington  but when it comes to paying overtime  getting you the equipment you need not the equipment they want to give you  providing the money directly to local communities and not passing it through the states  well  we haven't gotten what we know you need to protect our country  and in this latest budget  the president is proposing to cut funds for first responders at the department of homeland security to the tune of   billion  the way i see it  saying you believe in homeland security without funding first responders is like saying you believe in building a hospital without doctors and nurses  if we don't fund you  we're not funding our first line of defense  and we're going to need to work together to make that happen  and as harold knows  and all my folks from new york know  we have been fighting for interoperable communications since september   we have put in legislation  we've asked for more money  but when firefighters can't talk to police officers  when emergency responders can't talk to those form another  we not only saw it on september   we saw it again during hurricane katrina  a crisis that really  once again  put firefighters in the forefront  just think about what's happening where your brothers and sisters are trying to operate out of trailers  and they're still using ruined equipment that we still haven't replaced  what was a natural disaster was turned into a national disgrace  and we need to get the funds directly where they are needed  and being there for you means trying to end the war in iraq in the right way  because firefighters have fought and died in iraq  and we were heartbroken to learn that those who had fought and had been injured were languishing in walter reed  i went out there a week ago friday early in the morning to meet with a bunch of soldiers from new york  some of them had been tied up in the bureaucratic red tape until they were just beyond words  they couldn't figure out  what had i done to deserve this  i served my country  active duty  national guard  or reserve  why am i being treated like that  well  the   elections sent a strong message that we do not want our young men and women in uniform to be in the middle of a sectarian civil war  where they don't know who is shooting at them  and they can figure out whose side they're supposed to be on  we're trying to introduce some rationality in this  in the congress  trying to stop the escalation because i profoundly believe that putting more of our young men and women into harm's way   unless the iraqis decide to defend themselves   we cannot end this war for them  if they're not going to stand up and take responsibility  we should not lose another american life  we should end this escalation now  i hope that the president will extricate us from iraq before he leaves office  but let me assure you  if you doesn't  when i'm president  i will  being there for you means standing side by side with you in the fight for your most fundamental rights  as harold said in his introduction  i believe that it is absolutely essential to the way america works that people be given the right to organize and bargain collectively  nearly   years ago  when   delegates gathered for the first iaff convention    hours work weeks were the norm  and terrible conditions were a fact of life  you know why that's no longer the case  because of you  you organized  you unionized  you stood up for your rights  you said   we're not going to be invisible  we're doing our part  you have to give us safe working conditions  fair treatment  and the right to bargain  but some people still don't get it  you know they say that collective bargaining will undermine our national security  they think you haven't earned the right to organize  you know what i say to them  i say   would you change places  would you go into that fire  would you stand on those collapsing floors and under those crumbling ceilings  well the way i see it  when you plunge head first into burning buildings for a living  you have more than earned the right to organize for better conditions on the job  make no mistake about it  the days of george bush thinking the union bug is something he needs to squash are over  we are here to stand up for the rights of people who pull children out of raging waters and rescue people from flaming rooftops  we are here to stand up for the people who stand up for us  we have a lot of work head of us  and we could get some small victories along the way until we finally get the majorities we need to completely have an agenda that we support in the senate  they can still stop a lot of what we believe in  unfortunately  but we just have to keep electing more people who see the world the way we do  and we certainly will make a lot more progress when we take back the white house  back after the days of september   so many of you came to me and said that the families of firefighters who had been killed were confronting piles of paperwork just to get the benefits they were owed  they were told it would take weeks or months  and the families didn't have that kind of time  so again  working with harold and his team  we put together a bill  and my friend jerry nadler sponsored it in the house  and within a week that bill passed into law  and when the bill passed  we didn't declare victory or do some kind of big celebration  because the truth is  in the end  there was nothing we could do to give back to those families the people they had loved and lost  all we could do is to come together as a team and help as best we could  and in the end  we just followed the basic rule you live by  you never leave a brother or sister behind  well that's how i've tried to serve in the senate  that's how i've tried to set my priorities  and i want you to know that  if i do have the honor and the opportunity to be your president  that's what i will continue to do  now  people who know me will tell you i don't back down from a fight  and others use more colorful language sometimes about me  but that's just fine with me  i don't care what they say  i just care about what we do  that is what is important to me  and because i'm proud to fight for you because you fight for us  i'm going to stay on your side  i'm not in any way concerned by the fight we have ahead because i know we can win this fight  i know that if we stand together  we get our message out to america  if we steel ourselves to all of the criticism and the counter attacks and the stereotypes and everything that they'll put out  then we'll be victorious  i have a little experience at staying the course and in sticking with people who stick with me  st  augustine said a long time ago that hope is really the combination of two things  it's a combination of anger at the way things are and courage to change the way things are  well  living by hope and understanding  we can't be satisfied by what we see before us on homeland security or collective bargaining  but having the courage to step out and try to make a different future is one of reasons why i admire what you have done over the course of your work on behalf of firefighters  and i am thrilled and honored to stand with you  and together  we will make it clear that those of us who believe that courage and anger about what is  leads to hope  means that we will change america for the better  thank you all so much  and god bless you for everything you do  thank you  take care "], ["clinton", "it is such a pleasure to be with all of you today at the institute of politics here at st  anselm  thank you  melissa  for that wonderful introduction  and i hope you will give me a copy of your thesis  i need to read that  probably some very useful tips in it  and thank you for welcoming us here  it is wonderful to for me to have this occasion to be here at the institute of politics  it is a tradition that is certainly well known far beyond the boundaries of this state  and i commend the college for having such an active interest and involvement in the political process of our country and having excellent students like melissa who take advantage of those opportunities  this university for over one hundred years  has been inspiring young people like melissa and i am convinced of the quality of this school's graduates that i'm looking to hire some of them  and i have already made one hire  colin pio  class of   even before he has graduated to join my campaign  contingent of course upon receiving his diploma  that is the requirement for the kind of employment we are going to be offering  i'm here this afternoon to talk about the importance of government and how we make our government work for us  now  i know for some that might be an unusual choice of topic in the  live free or die  state  where the general feeling is  the less government  the better  but after what i have seen the last six years in washington  i certainly understand that sentiment  but what i want to talk about today has nothing to do with whether our government is big or small   and everything to do with whether it is competent or incompetent  whether it is corrupt or honest  whether it is devoted to the public interest or beholden to the special interests  despite their rhetoric  for the past six years  we've had an administration that doesn't believe in less government or smaller government or better government  they simply have contempt for government  though they lead it  they look down on it  they disparage it  they belittle it at every turn  and because they view our government with contempt   they treat it with contempt  since they don't believe government can be a force for the public interest   they treat it as a source of favors for private interests  they've created a government of the few  by the few  and for the few  our president has handed out jobs to his friends even when they were not qualified  given out no bid contracts to halliburton   even after they overcharged us by hundreds of millions of dollars  fired u s  attorneys who tried to uphold the law  silenced government scientists who told the truth  retaliated against a diplomat who refused to validate fabricated evidence of wmds in iraq  really  it is a stunning record of cronyism and corruption  incompetence and deception and it has shaken the faith of many americans in our government  when government consistently lets us down like this  we become cynical  we distrust our government   and grow to distrust democracy itself  we decide that politics is distasteful  and politicians just out for themselves  so why should we trust our government with our hopes  dreams and ideals  it really is a self perpetuating cycle  because this administration doesn't respect our government  they run it poorly  and it fails our people  they then point to government's failure to prove it's not worthy of respect  and this just makes it harder for us to work on the critical issues that affect people's lives   health care  energy independence  making college affordable and so much else that people throughout new hampshire and america talk to me about  and today  our families are paying a steep price  energy costs are up  health care costs are up  education costs are up  but wages and incomes are lagging  so while americans are working harder than ever   they're falling further and further behind  and we're seeing more and more inequality  it's like middle class and hard working families don't even exist to this administration  it's like they're invisible  for six long years  our president has looked right through them  if you were a victim of hurricane katrina   if you're one of the nearly   people still living in trailers   you're invisible  if you're a soldier who returned from iraq only to be warehoused in crumbling facilities at walter reed  fighting to get the treatment you need   you're invisible  if you're a parent who can't afford childcare or a student who can't afford college  a family that can't afford to get by on the minimum wage   while the wealthiest of us get tax cuts   you're invisible too  well  you're not invisible to the rest of america  and you're certainly not invisible to me  and when we take back the white house  you will no longer be invisible to the president of the united states  now  we know that government certainly isn't the answer to all our problems   that's not even close  but we also know that good government   smart government   can be a partner for progress  it can help us solve problems and accomplish things together that we could never accomplish alone  we've seen this in everything from the peace corps to americorps  from curing diseases to building the internet  from the end of ethnic cleansing in kosovo to the end of religious strife in northern ireland  this isn't about big government or small government   it should be about smart government  and we all know that in order to meet the big challenges of our day   to lift up the middle class and hard working families   to establish universal health care  energy independence and fiscal responsibility   to end the war in iraq and restore our leadership around the world   we need a government that is ready to rise to the occasion and lead us to our goals  we need to return to accountability and a system of checks and balances   to a congress that once again exercises oversight and accountability  we need a  st century government to meet our  st century challenges  but in order to reclaim our government  in a democracy after all  our government is us  you know as pogo once said  memorably  we've met the enemy and it is us  well our government is us  so by denigrating our government we undermine our capacity to work together to solve these problems  so we have to change the way business is being done  and i think we start by looking at what we expect from our families  our businesses  and our communities   and then asking ourselves  why can't our federal government do that  you can check your bank account online  why can't you go online and see how your government is spending   or misspending   your tax dollars  you go to the atm  stick in your card  and get money   why can't our government transfer medical records from the department of defense to the va  you make a budget for your family  and you don't spend what you don't have or what you don't need   why shouldn't our government do the same with our federal budget  you trust your doctor to give you honest advice about the medicines you take   why can't government scientists do the same when they regulate our food and drugs and study our environment  well  i believe our government can do all these things  and that we can be an example to ourselves and to the rest of the world  we can do it in so many ways  we can do it by leading through the government  we can be the institutional support for creating a market for energy efficiency  we can create the architecture for electronic medical records  we can provide information in a way that will enable us to do so much more in a cost effective way  now  i do know that people are cynical about our government and that's sort of the american birthright  but i believe that with the right leadership we can restore trust and faith in government  i believe america is ready for change  ready for a new start  and ready once again to make this government of the people  by the people  and for the people  we can re establish the competence of government  the confidence of citizens in government  and the capacity of our government to set goals and achieve them  today i want lay out a ten point agenda to do just that   an agenda for government reform  a plan to enhance accountability and transparency  to make government more efficient and effective for taxpayers  to restore competence and end the culture of cronyism  to replace secrecy and mystery with openness  a plan to make our government work for all americans again  first  we need to close the revolving door between government and lobbyists  this is exactly what governor lynch did during his first term in office when he created an independent ethics commission and required every member of his administration to file public financial disclosure forms  i think we should follow his lead in washington  and i'll start by permanently banning any of my cabinet officials from lobbying my administration once they've left office  we've seen the consequences of what happens when we let the revolving door keep turning  the recent medicare prescription drug bill offers a perfect example  by the time this bill became law  many of those who'd helped to write it and pass it had left government to become lobbyists for companies that sought to benefit from it  well  the way i see it  people shouldn't use what they've learned on the taxpayers' dime to enrich themselves at our expense   and we're going to put an end to it  second  we're going to strengthen whistleblower protections so we can root out corruption and cronyism  wherever it may lie  over the past six years  we've seen one scandal after another at our agencies  from an official in the white house doing favors for jack abramoff to an administrator at the department of education buying stock in the student loan companies he was supposed to oversee  and while whistleblowers play a critical role in alerting us to behavior like this  our whistleblower protection laws don't give people adequate protection   and too many are afraid to step forward  we've seen brave employees who speak up  stripped of their security clearances  pressured into resigning  or outright fired  take the example of jack spadaro  a mining engineer who was head of the national mine health and safety academy  he blew the whistle on what he felt was a whitewash by the bush administration of an investigation into a major coal slurry spill  and he was subsequently forced out of his job  there are hundreds of examples like that  we need to expand whistleblower protections to ensure that people who do the right thing are rewarded   not punished  that means protecting their anonymity   and protecting those who aid them as well  it means guaranteeing whistleblowers a true day in court  it means making sure those who are vindicated get real relief  including compensation  coverage of attorney's fees  and the option to transfer jobs  because no one should be afraid to hold our government accountable  third  when i'm president  i will once again appoint the most qualified  dedicated  public minded people to serve in government  now  that doesn't mean that i won't appoint people who support me  but what it does mean is that this administration could have appointed well qualified republicans of independent judgment to positions of trust in our government  instead  they often simply appointed their friends and supporters   qualified or not  a republican partisan whose job at the international arabian horse association did not prepare him for a job heading fema  people hired for the iraq reconstruction team based on whether they were pro life rather than whether they spoke arabic  they hired scores of environmental  health and safety regulators who came from the very industries they were supposed to oversee  and they purged the professional staff at the civil rights division in the department of justice  well  the results speak for themselves  tragic incompetence in the gulf coast  environmental standards weakened  corporate loopholes widened  an industry written prescription drug benefit that bars medicare from bargaining for lower prices  and a department of justice that  between   and   did not file a single voter discrimination suit brought by african americans or native americans  now  we tried to change this  when we were working to improve disaster response after hurricane katrina  i proposed that we require proper qualifications for the director of fema   something you would think you wouldn't have to write into the law  and my proposal eventually did become law  it was part of an overall reform package of fema  but when the president signed it  he specifically said that he wasn't going to necessarily follow the directions of having a qualified person head fema  he used what is called a signing statement  to pick and choose from the provisions in the law of what he would and would not enforce  we have to reign in these signing statements  the president has used them to go way beyond what any president before has ever done  and in effect to veto portions of bills that he just doesn't agree with  well when i'm president  the entrance to the white house will no longer be a revolving door for just the well connected   but a door of opportunity for the well qualified  and in order to attract the best people to government  i have joined on a bi partisan basis with some of my colleagues in both the senate and the house to propose a u s  public service academy   an undergraduate school modeled after our military service academies that will cultivate a new generation of leaders dedicated to public service  the academy would provide a four year  subsidized college education in exchange for a five year commitment to public service after graduation  it will help us produce a new generation of law enforcement officers  of civil servants of experts who will dedicate themselves to public service  we're seeing the retirement of so many people who have been doing the nuts and bolts work of the government for many years  and we don't see the pipeline filling with people who are willing to take these jobs  and yet i know that many young people are ready  willing and able to answer the call to serve  but they often graduate from college with so much debt that they can't imagine going into a public service career  so i hope that the academy will open the doors much more widely for young people who want to serve their country  fourth  we're going to stop outsourcing our government and put an end to the abuse of no bid contracts  over the past six years  this administration has steadily outsourced critical government functions to private companies  adding more than   million private contractors to the federal payroll  and today  government contractors have essentially become yet another special interest  with the top   contracting firms spending nearly   million since   to lobby the government for more business to leave the government and come to them  but these contractors  it turns out  are often more expensive than doing the work in the government   in fact  some contract employees cost twice as much as comparable federal workers  they're often less accountable and less competent  and just think of what happened at walter reed  when the army was forced to outsource maintenance to a private contract contractor  the number of people doing maintenance dropped dramatically  the contractor cut corners  fell down on the job   and our soldiers paid the price  all too often  this administration has handed out government contracts without even shopping around for the best price  today  there has been an explosion in no bid contracting  with almost half of the   billion spent on federal contracts being done now on a no bid basis  the result is fraud  waste  and abuse everywhere from afghanistan and iraq to the gulf coast  i propose that we eliminate   government contracting positions  saving our government between   and   billion a year  and that we insist on competitive bidding for the remaining contracts  so we get the most value for every taxpayer dollar  in the rare case where non competitive contracts might be appropriate  we'll make sure they have close oversight  it seems as thought he motto for the administration has been  what's a few billion tax dollars between friends  well  when i'm president  the days of billions in no bid contracts and handouts to companies like halliburton that in return for the work given to them picks up corporate headquarters and moves to dubai those days will be over  fifth  we're going to stop substituting ideology for science and evidence  and we're going to start giving the american people again the facts on the issues that matter to them and their families  over the past six years  this administration has tried to turn washington into an evidence free zone  whether it's stem cell research or plan b contraception or pollution or global warming or the safety of our food or the quality of our air   all too often  ideology has replaced facts  and truth has been the first casualty  the american people deserve better than that  way back in the  s  the white house had an office of technology assessment that was charged with just one task  telling us the truth about science  sorting out the competing claims and to the best of the scientists' abilities  telling us what to believe  for decades  they cut through the myths and the spin on everything from star wars to aids prevention to solar technology  it's time we put this office back in business  because our citizens should have the information they need about the issues that affect them  sixth  we're going to open up our government's balance sheets so you can see exactly where your tax dollars are going   and the results they're getting  as tax day approaches  you probably find yourself wondering just where all your hard earned money is going  well  i propose that we require government agencies to publish their budgets and their government contracts online for all to see  so if someone tries to sneak in special favors for their special interest  we can find out about it with the click of a mouse  and we won't just track government spending   we'll also track results with a new america results initiative  with the technology we have today  we can get real time data on just about anything   from the purity of our water to the health of our ecosystems to the condition of our roads and bridges  we'll gather and analyze that data to see whether our government programs are effective  we'll then post it online so that our citizens can have the most up to date knowledge about everything from the quality of their air to the traffic on their streets  information technology is revolutionizing every segment of society   from business  to education  to entertainment   and it's time that it revolutionized our government as well  we also need to go back to doing what was done during the clinton administration with the reinventing government initiative  known as rego  which bill started and asked vice president gore to head up  and the results were astonishing  rego was credited with saving taxpayers more than   billion over eight years by cutting the federal workforce  trimming layers of management  cutting subsidies for items like mohair and wool  and so  why don't we get back to doing that again if we're serious about having a government that works  we should be constantly asking ourselves the hard questions about why we're paying for something  and whether we should continue to do so  i also want to establish a new corporate subsidy information service  this watchdog agency will track every tax subsidy that congress gives to big corporations  so we'll know exactly how much each company gets   and we can track whether those subsidies actually promote results for the country and not just the company  those subsidies are supposed to have a public good element to them  that's why we provide tax dollars  and yet too often  we have no analysis and evaluation as to whether they are really worth what the taxpayers are paying  seventh  we're going to make sure our government pays its bills and lives within its means again   just like our families  that's what we did during my husband's administration  when we balanced the budget and turned record deficits into surpluses  it took discipline and determination  a lot of hard work  but again  the results speak for themselves  twenty two million new jobs  the longest peacetime economic expansion in history  and the savings rate was reflected in our attaining leverage once again in the world  we've moved from the largest debtor nation to a creditor nation  well  we're back in to the larger debtor nation again  that undermines our capacity to exercise leadership on important issues like trade and other strategic concerns  so  we need to return to the fundamental principle of pay as you go  eighth  i want to make government more user friendly across the board   and that starts with bringing more government services online  last year    million americans filed their income taxes online  i want to make it possible for virtually every transaction to be paperless  every day  americans read the news online  shop online  chat online  and it's time that our government went fully online as well  in order to do that  however  we're going to have to move to the ninth point of my reform agenda  we have to have government take the lead in modernizing its record keeping systems and take the lead in areas that really can change the market and behaviors to the benefit of us all  what do i mean by that  well  i know this doesn't sound particularly exciting  but it's really important  because  just look at what's happening to our veterans  just earlier this week  i spent a day in upstate new york visiting with a lot of our wounded and injured veterans  i was at the v a  in syracuse  new york  and then i went up to fort drum  which is up in the north country of new york  and i met with soldiers who had just returned from afghanistan and iraq  i met with over   of them who had been injured and or wounded  and here's what they told me  their medical records have been lost  one young soldier told me that he'd been hit by an ied on his convoy in baghdad  which is absolutely superb what our soldiers get at the point where they are beginning treatment to save their lives is extraordinary  we're saving so many lives that we couldn't have saved in the first gulf war  and then as he was on a gurney as he was being wheeled to the plane to take him to the army medical center in landstuhl  germany  someone came over  said   soldier  i'm putting this packet on your chest  it's your medical records  don't lose it  he gets on the plane  he's doped up for the long flight  they wheel him off in landstuhl  the medical records haven't been seen since  i hear that over and over again  and when a soldier moves from being treated in department of defense facilities  which do provide very good acute care  to either outpatient or into the v a  system  the records don't get transferred  the records get lost  there are so many examples of how our government is inefficient because we can't figure out how we computerize it  maybe some of you have read about the years of struggle to get the fbi to have a computer system that keeps track of their cases  still hasn't happened  at the cost of billions of dollars  well  we can fix this  we need to bring in private sector partners  we need to cut through red tape  and we need to begin to do what it takes to get our government to have information as readily available as we have in the rest of our lives  and our government can also lead by example  by pressing national issues like energy efficiency and health care reform  i've introduced legislation to require that government buildings become energy efficient  and that new buildings which the government constructs try to attain the highest leed standard  which is the gold standard for energy efficiency for a building  we can help to create markets with everything from new building materials to more energy efficient appliances to more fluorescent light bulbs by having the government lead by example  and with respect to health care reform  i've also worked on a bipartisan basis to help create the framework for electronic medical records so that we could begin to realize the cost savings that would come if we have medical records that were private and confidential  with encrypted codes for access  that could be available if you were visiting new york  and you have to go to an emergency room or just visiting another doctor here in new hampshire  and not have to go through a history again  tests you've taken before  the rand corporation has estimated we would save   billion a year in our health care system if we had electronic medical records  and the government has to lead with creating the architecture and standards for us to be able to do this  and not just create thousands of towers of babel that can't talk to each other  tenth and finally  we have to reform our election system  that's where our democracy starts  we have to make sure that every vote is counted and every vote counts   and we know that the best place to hold a government accountable is at the ballot box  unfortunately  there's been a lot of interference with our electoral system in the last years  and there have been new requirements that have been put up as obstacles  that have really discouraged people from exercising their right to vote  i've introduced legislation called the count every vote act  which is a comprehensive voting reform bill  it will make our voting systems more accountable and accessible  it will expand the right to vote of most of our citizens  it will create more opportunities for people to register to vote  and it will give greater assurances through paper verified ballots that those votes will be counted  we need more oversight in our electoral system to discourage manipulation and deception  it is almost heart breaking that i have to mention this on my reform agenda  american should lead the world in the best electoral system  using the best equipment  a few years ago  there was an election in india  we are the oldest democracy  india is the largest democracy  they had an election  and no one predicted the outcome  everyone thought that the then bjp party in power would be sent back in to power  there was an earthquake  congress party won the election  there were no complaints  there were no disagreements  people accepted the results  even though indian politics can get extremely exciting  and i asked some of my indian friends   we've had two elections  and we've had complaints  we've had people turned away at the voting booth  we've had people misled about where and when they were supposed to vote  we've had ballots lost  how could you have done this   very simple  they said   we have turned it in to into a nonpartisan  civil service effort  where we have an independent board  like our federal reserve board   that runs our national elections  and we computerized everything  so whether you were a peasant woman in rajasthan  or a billion dot com entrepreneur in delhi  you voted on computers  and in order to deal with the problem of illiteracy  you had both words and pictures so that people could know who they were voting for  and your vote would be automatically recorded in the computer where you were polled and in a regional server and in a national server as a failsafe  you know  someone after hearing that story said  well maybe we should outsource our elections to india  i mean  it's sort of is a sad commentary to think about  but here we are the leaders in all this technology  we invented it  and we can't figure out how to use it for our own purposes  so  i'm convinced we can do everything i've outlined with the right leadership  people are ready for this change  in fact  it's the only way we can restore confidence in our government again  now  i know i've covered a lot of ground today  and it's not exactly the kind of subject matter that gets people marching in the streets  but if we don't restore competence in our government and confidence in our government  we will see the steady erosion of our government's capacity  there are some who argue that ideologues may have that in mind discourage people from believing in government  render it incompetent  make people give up on this great enterprise known as our government  oh  we'll still appropriate money for defense and homeland security but  beyond that  not much else  well  we can reject such a cynical perspective by beginning to implement this reform agenda  when i was working on this speech  i remembered a story that former secretary of state  my friend  madeleine albright once told me about a tour she took through the czech republic in   to celebrate the  th anniversary of the end of world war ii  in every town she visited  the czech people were out waving american flags  but the flags had only   stars  it turns out that american troops had given out these flags at the end of world war ii    years before   and that families had treasured them  had kept them through communists and the invasion of czechoslovakia  and all of the problems they confronted  through all those years of communist repression  the czech people held on to them and to the hope they represented  they wouldn't give up on america's ideals   and neither should we  it is past time that we once again have a government that works and that works for all of us  for leaders who never forget that it is your votes that put them in power   your tax dollars that pay the bills   your nation they are leading  it's time for a president who earns your trust and respect one day at a time  a president who never forgets that  as the great granite stater  senator daniel webster once said   we are all agents of the same supreme power  the people  if you give me that chance  i will be that president  thank you all  very  very much "], ["clinton", "thank you all very much  it is such a pleasure to be here at north beach and i want to thank superintendent rudy crew  i've known the superintendent for many years  worked with him when he was in new york and am delighted to have this chance to reconnect with him here in miami  i want to thank the principal  mr  luther grey for welcoming me  i have a little personal rule when i walk into a school and i've walked into probably by now thousands of schools over the years  just to get a feeling for what the school is like and if there are teachers around  to ask the teachers what its like  ask the students  if the parents are there ask them  and the real support and enthusiasm for this school is just palpable  and i'm so grateful for all of you being here and i wanted to commend not only the principal and all of the teachers but the entire school community  students and the parents and the family members who make this school work so well  this is a gift  my beautiful  beautiful necklace from two of the pre k students  sofia and savannah and it matches my jacket so i had to wear it and it has my initials  so i'm feeling very dressed up today  i'm here to talk about an issue that i've been working on for a very long time  going back to when i was in law school and became concerned about how we cared for and educated our youngest children  because i believe that we have to do our best with our children from the very beginning for thirty five years as a lawyer and an advocate  as a friend lady and a senator and most importantly as a mom  i have been strongly in support of providing the tools to parents that would give parents an opportunity to recognize that they are their child's first teachers and that the family is their child's first school  because we have to have a strong partnership between our families and our schools and our society on behalf of our children  i've seen what happens when caring adults come together and make a commitment to insure that each child has a chance to fulfill his or her god given potential  years ago when my husband was governor of arkansas  i brought a program to arkansas from israel that helped to train parents   mostly mothers and some grandmothers   about how to prepare their own children for school  we talked to them and helped them understand the importance of reading to their children  of talking to their children  of even using household objects to teach basic lessons  the difference between a spoon and a fork  for example  because what we knew is that when children entered kindergarten or first grade  a lot of children who had a very good basic beginning by how they were raised and what they were exposed to  were so far ahead of other children who didn't have that set of opportunities  i believe its important that we work as families to help to encourage them  to understand that things that seem very simple like talking to a child and reading to a child  lay the groundwork for brain development and for a child being able to do well later on  i see this when i visited the head start programs  where children were learning to read and count and solve problems and work with each other  have a chance to develop the habits that we need in society so that people get along  we all know about the 'terrible twos' and we know about the sometimes rebellious fours and trying to figure out how to structure settings so kids can learn what it will take to be successful in this society is so important  not only for the children but for all of us  and early this morning  i was here in north beach and met some of the pre k children and teachers and then i just toured the three classrooms and i'm very impressed with the quality of interaction and instruction and with the lessons that children are learning  not only the academic lessons  where i saw children circling all the letter h or all the letter g or doing the alphabet puzzles or using rhyming cards to begin to do what they need to understand words and get ready for reading  but also getting along with each other  respecting each other  something that we really need in the world today  and i think every child should have the same opportunity to learn and grow and develop at the four year olds here at north beach are doing  because the fact is  we cannot succeed in the global economy today unless our children universally are given the best start in life and then can take advantage of education and enter the world ready to be productive  obviously if you look at the entire education system there's a lot of work we have to do  we have to make college more affordable and i've talked a lot about that  we have to make it possible for our teachers to have working conditions that give them the chance to be the best teachers we can be  there's a lot of things we need to do to reform and change no child left behind  which is an unfunded mandate on our school  but we all know that preparing children to attend college or to start a career  to get the skills they need  starts way earlier than that  i'm going to be proposing throughout my campaign  additional investments in even younger children  those   because parents need high quality child care and much more in the way of parental support in education about how to do best job they can  today  fewer than   of our four year olds in america are in pre k programs that are funded by our various states  that's what i want to discuss because i think our educational system needs to be strengthened from start to finish  but we have to start where it all begins  today i'm announcing a proposal to establish universal pre kindergarten education  access to high quality pre kindergarten for every single four year old in america  our children are growing up in a world that is vastly more competitive and certainly a lot more technologically advanced than when most of us were those ages  i go into classrooms and it's pretty much familiar to me because it looks exactly like looked when i was in elementary school and that was a long time ago  and we have a lot of working care  a lot of single moms supporting kids  we have a lot of differences now than what we used to have  so how do we help prepare all of our children to be as successful as they possibly can  i've talked to lots of teachers about what happens the first day of kindergarten  the first day of first grade  some children arrive already knowing how to write their name  they know how to interact with their peers  they thrive in a structured environment  others don't  they are not even sure of how to fit in  or what they are supposed to do  they certainly don't know how to spell their names  in fact some of them don't even know their full name because they've been called by a nick name for so much of their lives  we can't let that continue if we expect our children to be successful  we can talk all we want about how public schools are great equalizers and engines of our meritocracy in america  but if children start school behind  it is likely they will stay behind and by the third or fourth grade they are already feeling like they don't fit in  they are not comfortable  they are being labeled failures and i don't think that's what we want for our children  many families cannot afford the kind of pre k program on their own that i see here in this school  many parents struggle to try to find somebody to take care of their children in a safe environment while they go to work  during the time that i was first lady  i hosted a white house conference on child care and one on how the brain develops because it was becoming very clear that in the first give years of life  so much of the brain develops  you don't think about that but that's exactly what's going on when children are making connections  their brains are making those connections  as well  and unfortunately we cut back in the last six years on investments in early childhood  this administration has not provided adequate funding for quality childcare  they've cut head start   in the last five years and unfortunately proposed to cut another   slots this year alone  nearly   of them in florida  i don't understand that because i really do believe that children deserve our attention and they deserve our resources and our investment  too many children  though  and their needs are just not being seen in washington today  if your child is sitting in a crumbling school and i've been in those  you're invisible  if you're a single mom who can't afford safe  quality child care  you're invisible  too  if you're a family that works and can't afford health care your child needs to have his eye checked or her teeth checked  you're invisible  as well  if you're a teacher who is not getting the respect and pay you deserve from the hard work you put in  you're invisible  i think we shouldn't allow anyone in america to be invisible and in order to do that we have to change our priorities as a nation  we should start with our youngest children  a lot of people say  well that's a nice thing to do but what does that have to do with all the big problems we face in the world  in fact  some people  when i talk about the need to really help prepare children  they sort of say  well that's a nice thing to be for  but kind of soft  i mean it's not really that important  is it  but we know that it is  not only do we know that the brain develops in those early years and it is hard to imagine that some children come into kindergarten or first grade knowing lots of words and knowing their meanings  that gives them a tremendous head start  some children for whom english is not the first language  they struggle with that  so we have to work to do across the board  but it is not just the right thing to do or the nice thing to do  we now have lots of evidence from hard headed economists that investing in early childhood makes sense  according to one study conducted by nobel prize winning economist james heckman of the university of chicago  you can close half the gaps in testing between african american and white students that shows up at the end of high school if you have pre school  you can also begin to deal with a lot of behavior problems that kids come into school with  these early years do not pre ordain a child's life  many children from difficult and disadvantaged childhoods can become extraordinary adults  but this is a critical moment in time  and we are squandering it right now  i go to schools and i see so many children who just don't fit in  they feel left out  they feel overwhelmed  lots of times  the teachers are overwhelmed  there is not enough help in the school to give them the attention they need  so i'd like to make sure that we offer pre kindergarten to every four year old in america  and we should make it an offer  if not required  we should certainly encourage parents to do this and tell then what the facts are  children who attend pre kindergarten are less likely to enroll in special education  they are less likely to drop out of high school  they are more likely to go on and graduate from college  they are less likely to be unemployed  and they are less likely to go on welfare  as professor heckman said  early learning begets later learning  and early success begets later success  and if you add up all the benefits  it's is really astonishing  another study done by the federal reserve bank of minneapolis show that investing in early childhood shows an annual rate of return of between   and   in other words  you put in a dollar in early childhood  you are going to get at least seven dollars back  and imagine if you could buy a stock with that kind of return  that is why a lot of business groups including the committee on economic development support universal pre kindergarten  and it is not only for our family budget  it is good for everybody's budget  the cost of childcare  even if the childcare is frankly not that good  is pretty high these days  isn't it  and think about the savings that families could have if pre kindergarten was accessible as public kindergarten is  it is also important to recognize that other countries are doing this  you know  a lot of our competitors really are starting earlier because they understand that they will get better results  it is also startling to realize that many people who plan what kinds of prisons have to be built and how big they need to be say they look at third grade readings course to project how many children will grow up into trouble  teenagers and adults and end up in the prison system  and we spend a lot of money on prisons in this country  if we could avoid spending money on prisons  we could certainly make our society better  and we can pay for this by cutting back on some of the expenditures that the current administration is doing  we could consistently fail to invest in what saves us money  i remember during the  s  the federal government was trying to immunize children during the  s  and in the  s that was all cut back  it was an attempt to save money  but what happened is because so many children weren't immunized  there was measles epidemic between   and   that struck     people  killed   of them  many of their children and it cost the country   million dollars to cope with the measles epidemic  so  it makes sense to try and prevent problems instead of paying for them  and we can do this by creating some cuts in programs that really don't add up  in all of the assessments of how much this would cost  we believe that investing in pre kindergarten now will end up saving the government about   billion dollars over time  in not having as many prisons  in having more productive adults who will make more money  in avoiding the cost of illiteracy and dropouts  so it is a pretty good investment and a lot of states understand that  we have about   states now that invest in pre k  and recently here in florida  six former governors of florida and the wife of late governor lawton chiles  all sides of different viewpoints signed a letter urging florida to make good on the constitutional amendment that the people of florida have voted for back in   see  florida was way ahead of everybody  and the people of florida were really in the vanguard of this  saying let's provide a universal pre k  and i want to start by investing   billion dollars in matching grant for the gold state  now in a state like florida which is already beginning to do this  the money would help you go to the next level  to make sure that there was a program everywhere of high quality  in order to receive the money  states would have to hire teachers with bachelor's degrees who had specialized in early childhood development  they have to develop learning standards and curricula if they don't already have them  and ensure low teacher child ratios so that every child gets an individual attention that the child needs  and of course you would have to have to health and safety oversight that is required  i would also require states to coordinate with community based providers  work with head start  i am a big believer in head start and i had fought to protect head start and also  to early provide head starts so we can begin to help children who are particularly at risk  and if there are problems in having enough money  i would want the state to target the children who need it the most  my daughter didn't need it  we sent her to pre school  we had her in pre school program because we knew it would be good for her  to have the interaction with other children  to be with other adults besides her father and me  and we had some great experiences from that  we also ran into some challenges  there is a period of time when my daughter would only eat green grapes and jelly sandwiches  and she took a bunch of green grapes and jelly sandwiches to pre school every day to eat during her break  and the state was monitoring the pre school program and they had a supervisor from the state seeing how the children were treated and at the end of the week  the supervisor said to the head teacher 'i think the program is very good but there is this one child who is really going to be poorly served  she may end up being mal nourished because everyday she brings the same thing for lunch ' so the head teacher said  well yeah i know  that is the governor's daughter  laughter  and that is what she is eating this week ' obviously  i thought it was worth doing it for my own child  and i think it is worth doing it for every child  i believe that we can increase our investments once we see that it works and when people say 'where we will get the   billion dollars to start this program ' there are so many to cut the money that is being spent in this government  let's start by cutting     off the contractors that the bush administration had added  who don't do a job that is held   applause i think we can find a lot of other waste  obviously we are spending more than half a trillion dollars on the iraq war and when we finally end that  we are going to have to start getting ourselves out of deficit  but we need at the same time to make some investment that will help keep our country strong  so i am excited about doing this   applause  years ago  my first job out of law school was to work for the children's defense fund and it is one of the great jobs you could have because if you care about children's futures  if you believe it is important to do everything possible to help them  there is no better place  and the head of the children defense fund marian wright edelman once said  if we don't stand for children  we don't stand for much  and i could not agree more  i saw these beautiful children here in this school today and every one of them has a divine spark inside  every one has the potential to be the kind of person that we all hope our children would grow up to be  parents and family members have the first and primary responsibility  but then the rest of us have a role to play  that is why i wrote a book ten years ago called 'it takes a village'  because you can be the best parent in the world and think you are doing the very best job  but your child is going to be affected by people you will know like teachers  and people you will never meet like police officers who try to keep the streets safe or people who check that the water you drink is safe  if we think about our responsibility for all our children  we will start making investments that will not only help our children but i believe really help us  so  today to stand up for our children  let's do what is done here in this school  i am looking at these young people here wearing their north beach shirts and i am still proud that they are going to a school that really values them and appreciates how important it is that we make good investments  i am a big believer in public education and i am not giving up on public education  i think public education is absolutely essential  applause  and one thing people rarely talk about is when you look at test scores and analyze assessments  private schools don't do better than public schools  but a lot of people believe that because everything that happens in the public school is public information  if something bad happens in a public school  it is going to be in the newspaper  if something happens in a private school  you are not going to read about it  i think it is time that we really invest in our public schools  so let's begin by investing more in our in our youngest children  applause  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", "well  colleen  i can assure you that as president  i will strongly support schools like the manchester school for technology  i have for many years because i know how important schools like this are  at this very moment  students in this school may be learning how to wire an office building  or work the machinery that runs our automobiles  or fix the bugs that crash our computers  every day  students at this school are discovering talents and strengths they never knew they had and that is because this school has great leadership  i want to especially thank the principal  karen white has led this school in an exemplary fashion  and i know she's worked closely with governor lynch to design the plans that will enable the school to be renovated and grow even stronger in the future  i really applaud your leadership  karen  because you can't look at the manchester school of technology without realizing that it didn't happen by accident  it was built by the people of this state who  even   years ago  understood that to compete in today's economy  young people need the skills for today's jobs  that's what we've always done here in america  when our economy changes  we don't panic or give up or wring our hands   we simply change with it  that's what has happened here at mst  i really applaud you for doing that  because we have to look for examples like this to figure out what we need to do more broadly across our nation  now we've done this before  we did the same thing back at the turn of the  th century  back then  the american economy was dominated by large corporate monopolies  corruption was far too common and good government far too rare  women couldn't vote  and the minimum wage  well  that wasn't heard of and worker rights were completely unimagined  back then  america was a country filled with haves and have nots   and not enough people in between  in response to these excesses  the progressive movement was born  throughout the late  s and early  s  the progressives busted trusts and fought for safe working conditions and fair wages  they created the national park system  and replaced a government rife with cronyism with a merit based civil service  they understood  as the great progressive president teddy roosevelt once said  that  the welfare of each of us is dependent fundamentally upon the welfare of all of us  well  today  at the beginning of the  st century  i think it's time we remembered those lessons  for the first time in history  we have a truly global economy  workers today think nothing of holding teleconferences with colleagues on three continents at once or e mailing business partners across the globe  companies also think nothing of shipping our jobs   even entire factories   overseas  today  competition no longer stops at the water's edge  in fact  for many of our companies  that's where it starts  for example  new hampshire provides   billion worth of exports to   countries a year  at the same time  technology is playing an increasingly important role  it's really revolutionizing how we live and work  we're seeing u s  telemarketing jobs done in remote locations far  far from our shores  manufacturing requires fewer jobs as machines replace people both here in america and around the world  in part because india and china have begun to harness the power of technology  they are on their way to becoming economic super powers  like it or not  that is the reality of globalization  and it isn't going away  however  if managed properly  globalization may offer the promise of new markets  new growth  and new opportunities for broadly shared prosperity to young people like colleen  unfortunately  we're not managing globalization properly  instead of working for all of us  globalization is working only for a few of us  now  it is working for corporations  corporate profits have grown an average of   a year since   adjusted for inflation  it's working for ceos who've seen their pay go from   times the typical worker's in   to   times the typical worker in   and it's working for americans with incomes at the very top  in   all income gains went to the top   of households  while the bottom   saw their incomes decline  in spite of the fact that worker productivity has increased for six years  now  in past economic expansions  that's not the way it was  in the past  about   of net corporate revenues have gone to employee compensation  and only   to profits  however  for the past five years  the comparable figures are   going to employee compensation and   going to profits  think about this  last year  the share of america's national income going to corporate profits was the highest since     while the share going to the salaries of american workers was the lowest  the inescapable reality is that globalization  modern technology  economic policy  are creating new conditions that threaten our middle class families and make it harder to maintain a middle class lifestyle  now  during the second half of the  s  productivity growth led to rising incomes across the board  but over the past six years  while productivity has gone up   percent   that means americans are working harder than ever and  by most indicators  working harder than anybody else in the rest of the world   family incomes have gone down   the global labor market may even be depressing wages for skilled and professional jobs  since   new jobs created in america pay  on average    percent less than the jobs we have lost  and back in   child poverty was the lowest it had been in   years  since then it has risen by   million  and today we have   million children living in poverty  now  given these realities  it's unsurprising we're seeing rising inequality and rising pessimism in our workforce  today more than   percent of americans believe that our manufacturing jobs are at risk of being outsourced  and let's be clear  it's not as if america hasn't been successful economically the past   years  but the measure of success doesn't relate what's happening in households across our country  because  while productivity and corporate profits are up  the fruits of that success just hasn't reached many of our families  it's like trickle down economics  but without the trickle  as a result  the gap between those who are enjoying the fruits of the modern economy and those who aren't is growing wider  in   the top   percent of households held roughly   percent of our nation's income  in   they held   percent  the highest level since   a year that isn't exactly one of our best years in american history  now  our founders knew that inequality wasn't good for our country  they believed that vast concentrations of wealth were a threat to democracy  they believed america should give everyone  not just the children of the landed gentry  the chance to fulfill their god given potential  but today  that ideal is at risk  we are in danger of losing that uniquely american engine of opportunity that has created so much wealth and spread it so widely  believe it or not  today in some parts of europe there is more social mobility than right here in america  well  now we haven't heard much from washington in the past six years about how to solve this growing problem of inequality  in fact  the tax  investment  trade and budget policies of the administration and its allies in congress have made the problem worse  i believe people are fed up with the policies of the past six years  so many people i talk to just want to hit the restart button on the  st century and redo it the right way  and i agree with them  now  after all  we started the decade with rising incomes  declining inequality  robust job growth and a surplus in our federal budget  instead of building on policies that worked  the washington republicans reversed them with predictable but intolerable consequences  i believe that one of the most crucial jobs of the next president is to define a new vision of economic fairness and prosperity for the  st century  a vision for how we ensure greater opportunity for our next generation  and then to outline a strategy and then to implement it  today  i believe we need a new progressive vision for this new century  now  i consider myself a thoroughly optimistic and modern progressive  i believe we can grow our economy in the face of global competition  and in a way that benefits all americans  i believe we can curb the excesses of the marketplace and provide more opportunities for more americans to succeed  i believe we can support and promote smart trade policies that truly enforce strong labor and environmental standards  i believe we can help more workers join unions to improve wages and conditions in our workplaces for jobs that cannot be shipped overseas  i believe that  just as  th century progressives fought corruption with a new civil service  we can restore competence to the front lines of our government and ensure that we never  ever experience another hurricane katrina  in short  i believe that our government can once again work for all americans  it can promote the great american tradition of opportunity for all and special privileges for none  today i want to focus on how we ensure both strong economic growth and economic fairness  now  we have seen for more than a century that fairness doesn't just happen  it requires the right government policies  and no one should be surprised  human nature being what it is  people will go as far as they possibly can get away with  the genius of the american economic in the  th century was that it helped to counter that tendency for people to push as far as their own interests would take them so that we created a leveler playing field that benefited everyone  unfortunately  for the past six years it's as though we've gone back to the era of the robber barons  year after year the president has handed out massive tax breaks to oil companies  no bid contracts to halliburton  tax incentives to corporations shipping jobs overseas  tax cut after tax cut to multimillionaires  while ignoring the needs and aspirations of tens of millions of working families  and how has he paid for all of this largess  by running up record deficits  he has simply charged it to our national credit card and left our children and grandchildren to pay the bill  in fact  every baby born today starts like with   of national debt on his or her tiny shoulders  the largest birth tax in our nation's history  it's also important to understand these policies are consistent with the administration's theory about how we should manage our economy  leave it all up to the individual  that's why they want to privatize social security and let individuals bear the risks  it's why their answer to the health care crisis is limited to creating health savings account  which allows the healthiest people to get the best deal  with little concern if the sickest get worse  they call it the ownership society  but it's really the  on your own  society  on the other hand  they protect the drug companies from competition  including from their own products coming back across the border from canada  and they give health care companies a subsidy of more than   per person to compete with medicare  that is hardly the free market at work  as a result  too many of our families are left running in place or falling behind  health care premiums have gone up   percent since   college costs up   percent since the   school year  gas prices have more than doubled  and i don't need to tell anyone that they're heading even higher today  wages and incomes are lagging so much that  after five years of overall growth  there's been a   percent increase in the percentage of workers falling below the poverty line  and a   percent increase in working families losing their health insurance  it's like our middle class and hardworking families are invisible to this president  if you're a worker who can't organize for fair wages and safe working conditions  you're invisible  if you're one of the over   million americans who don't have health insurance  you're invisible  too  if your company has shipped your job overseas and you don't know how to pay your bills  well  you're invisible  if you drive up to the gas station and have to pay well over   or   a gallon to fill up your tank  you're invisible as well  well  you're not invisible to me  and we can't restore the american dream unless you're a very visible part of it  it's time for a new beginning  for an end to government of the few  by the few and for the few  time to reject the idea of an  on your own  society and to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity  i prefer a  we're all in it together  society  now  there is no greater force for economic growth than free markets  but markets work best with rules that promote our values  protect our workers and give all people a chance to succeed  when we get our priorities in order and make the smart investments we need  the markets work well  some of you might remember that  while we began the  s with record deficits  we ended the decade with a balanced budget  a record surplus  higher wages for the middle class  and   million new jobs  now  of course  we can't simply recycle the policies that worked in the  s  these are different times  but we can return to many of the principles that guided us then  the principles that have worked time and time again to build our economy  expand opportunity  and offer all americans the chance to have that american dream which we promised  now  i'm the product of this chance  i grew up in a middle class family in the middle of america in the middle of the last century  my father came back from world war ii after having served in the navy  and he worked hard to build his small business  he believed that one should avoid being in debt at all costs  and instilled in me the importance of being responsible with a budget at an early age  a value i still hold dear today  like millions of other families  we worked hard  we saved and we invested  and together  our determination and work ethic helped to create the american middle class  now that middle class is under assault from global economic forces and wrongheaded economic policies  so i'm proposing a new progressive plan to restore that american dream and to give all americans the chance to compete and prosper in the global economy  here's what i believe we should do  first  i'm going to work to level the playing field and reduce the special breaks for big corporations  we say this in every campaign  we make a little bit of progress  and then unfortunately  when the republicans get back in office  they reverse everything we've done and add to the corporate welfare  well  i think we're going to have a better shot this time because we're going to make it an issue in this campaign  we're going to ask people who are running for congress to sign up one way or the other  are they for corporate welfare  or are they for the average american having a decent shot at the american dream  and there's a lot we could do right now  you know  i believe that if we did give medicare the chance to negotiate with drug companies  we would save   billion to   billion a year  why should the drug companies be immune from the process that goes on every day in america  where you bargain for the best deal you can get  and we need to give our government that opportunity to do so  when bill was president  he gave it to the v a  which is one of the reasons why the v a  has the lowest drug prices in america today  bargaining really does make a difference  we also need to require the big oil companies that are making the largest profits in the history of the world to invest in alternative energy themselves or pay into a fund to spur clean energy research and development  and there are many other examples that we could all give about how to zero in on corporate welfare  second  let's once and for all get rid of the incentives for american companies to ship jobs and profits overseas  it is one thing for the marketplace to encourage overseas investment  it's another for our own tax code to do so  but that's exactly what is happening  today  american companies that ship jobs overseas don't have to pay a penny in american taxes on the profits they make abroad unless they bring those profits back to the united states  and  of course  they don't bring them back because they don't want to pay taxes on them  it's estimated this policy costs us billions of dollars each year in lost tax revenues  even worse  we actually put companies that want to create jobs here on our shores at a disadvantage to those who ship jobs to tax havens  now  when i'm president we're going to reward decisions to create jobs here at home  we will consider eliminating the deduction for the actual costs of moving jobs  these are decisions that  if there's going to be a level playing field  there should be no advantage given to anyone who takes a job and sends it overseas at the disadvantage of our workforce  third  let's reform the governance of our corporations and our financial sector  if you have any doubt about whether corporate governance impacts ordinary americans  just think back to what happened at enron  where thousands of workers lost much of their retirement savings  the way i see it  allowing ceos to escape with golden parachutes while their companies abandon workers' pensions does not honor our values  we need to open up ceo compensation to public scrutiny and public challenge and ensure that boards of directors are independent when determining ceo pay  and we need to update our regulations to confront the emerging problems in our sub prime and private equity markets  fourth  let's restore fiscal responsibility to our government  let's get back to balanced budgets and save social security instead of running up our deficits  you know  people ask me all the time   why can't we get tough on china  well  the answer is  because china is one of our bankers  we're their debtor  how can we truly enforce trade laws against a country that manipulates it currency and puts us at an unfair advantage when our economic stability depends on china's massive loans to us every single day  and when the president's irresponsible tax breaks for high income americans expire  we will return to the income tax rates for upper  income americans that we had in the  s  rates that were consistent with a balanced budget and economic growth  for middle class americans  who haven't seen their paychecks increase  let's keep the middle class tax cuts and reform the alternative minimum tax in order to give middle class americans the tax relief they deserve to have  and let's take a hard look at corporate tax reform  it's simply not fair that as corporate profits have skyrocketed  the percentage of taxes paid by corporations have fallen  it's time we restored the balance and required corporations to pay their fair share  under the law  after all  they are citizens of the united states  with many of the responsibilities  i would argue  that goes with citizenship  fifth  let's recommit ourselves to the idea that every young person in america who wants to should have the opportunity to attend college  and that a  st century education starts early in life and continues well into adulthood  we know that having the most skilled  educated workforce in the world is key to our future success  that starts at the very beginning  with access to universal pre kindergarten  high quality learning opportunities for every  year old in america  and i've laid out a proposal that would do exactly that  we know that pre kindergarten keeps kids in school longer  keeps them out of trouble  gives them more incentive to be academically interested and that it is a good payoff for our country  for every dollar invested  we get a   return  the alternative is to pay costs in other ways  a startling fact is that some states in our country  when they're planning how many prison beds they need  look at third grade test scores  and they extrapolate from the number of children who are failing in third grade reading as to how many prison beds they'll need  that's a lot more expensive than providing pre  kindergarten to those same children to hopefully keep them out of our prisons  we also have to do more to raise up the opportunity for young people from middle class and working families and poor families to be able to go to college  seventy five percent of students at america's elite colleges come from the top   percent of the income bracket  just   percent from the bottom   percent  we've got to make college affordable again  and that means everything from increasing pell grants to changing the way college loans are provided and cleaning up the college loan industry from all of the scandals that is besetting it  because if we don't make college affordable  we are seeing the results  young people can't go  the last time i was in manchester i was talking with some of the teachers from one of the high schools here who told me that many young people were just really confused because they didn't have the money to go to college  and they didn't know what they were going to do  so we've got to do a better job than that  sixth  for those who don't attend four year colleges and those in the workforce who need to update their skills  let's provide more support for schools like this and for community colleges that prepare people for good  high paying jobs  and let's provide wage insurance for our workers so that if you lose your job because of our trade policies  you can get the training and support you need for a new and better job  there are a lot of jobs in our country that are going begging because we don't have the people with the skills to be able to fill those jobs  two examples  we will need   automotive mechanics every year from now until   automotive retailing today reports that we have   vacancies for mechanics right now  these jobs pay salaries up to   a year  and employers are aggressively recruiting talented high school graduates to fill these positions  i met recently with the machinist union  they were telling me the same thing about airline mechanics  they have hundreds of good jobs they can't fill  it's not just that we can't fill these jobs  it's that we've come to a point in our society where  frankly  we don't have the respect that that these jobs should demand  this is something i feel very strongly about  we have sent a message to our young people that if you don't go to college and you don't have a high paying job something like a basketball player or an entertainer  or maybe someone in a corporation that you're thought less of in america  we have to stop this  our country cannot run without the people who do the skills that are taught in this school  and it is time we begin to reverse the attitude that i think for too long has prevailed  which is why i'm so pleased that governor lynch will be adding to the money available through the state for technology and other kinds of advanced degree learning that can give young people a belief that doing these jobs is important  as senator  i championed regional skills alliances that support employers in the same geographic region and industry  they support employers who pool their resources and broaden opportunities so that employees can get the training they need in today's economy  i think we need more programs like this  and when i'm president  we're going to create more programs like this so that our workers will have the skills they need for the jobs they deserve  those   people who come at night  that's what they're doing  they're trying to get additional skills that will enable them to fill jobs that already exist in this region  and we're going to create more jobs and more regional skills alliances when i'm president  seventh  let's ensure that people who work hard every day can support their families and save for the future  i do not believe anyone who works full time in america should draw a wage that puts that person below the poverty line  if you are a full time worker you should make more than poverty  now that we've finally reach the minimum wage  let's expand and simplify the earned income tax credit so no one working full time lives in poverty  let's also finally overhaul our unemployment insurance program  today's unemployment benefits aren't even enough to keep an average family above the poverty line  and many workers in today's economy   including part time and self employed workers   are still ineligible for unemployment insurance  our unemployment system has hardly changed at all over the last   years  and yet we know a lot of employers don't want to give people full time jobs  they only give them part time jobs so they don't have to pay for benefits  so when someone is laid off or loses that part time job  under our existing system even though it was all they could get  they're not eligible for unemployment insurance help  so i'm hoping that we can do a better job by looking at our unemployment system and bringing it into the modern age  i think we also have to have a modern attitude toward unions  we know that unionized workers make   more than workers who aren't in unions  but today  just   of our workplace in the private sector is unionized  we need to give workers more of the benefits that come with union membership  let's pass the employee free choice act to make sure our unions can organize for fair wages and safe working conditions  let's appoint people to the department of labor who are truly pro labor  that would be an unusual idea  don't you think  unions played a critical role in building the middle class  and i don't think it's a coincidence that as union membership has dropped  middle class incomes have stagnated  so this is not an either or choice  we can have both  some people say  well  if you have more unionization that would make america uncompetitive  but there are other countries in the global economy that pay wages equal to or higher than ours  and many jobs that are important to the economy in those countries demand a really good living wage for a middle class family  their lower paid workers are paid more than our lower paid workers  but their higher paid workers are paid less  so there's less of a gap between our lower paid workers and our highest paid workers which means that there's more money for those wage increases in the middle  that's what worked for america until relatively recently  and that's what we have to persuade people is good for america again  eighth  let's ensure everyone the most fundamental benefit there is   quality  affordable health care  now  we know that this is going to be challenging but if we could spend more than   billion to fund the war in iraq  we can surely make the basic investments to ensure that every american can see a doctor when he or she needs to  ninth and finally  let's make the investments we need to create the millions of good jobs necessary to lift up all of our families  to preserve and expand the middle class in an open  global economy  we have to have a source of good new jobs every five to eight years  telecom did that during the  s  in this decade  that means an all out commitment to a clean  independent energy future  i'll be talking a lot more about investing in alternative energy and energy efficiency  because we know that alternative energy isn't just good for our national security  and we know that it's imperative for our environment and to tackle global warming   but it is also good for our economy  by working to break our addiction to foreign oil and investing in clean energy technology  we can create good new jobs right here in america  when i was up in berlin  they were hoping that we could take those old paper and pulp mills and turn them into energy creators by using wood  so instead of using wood for the purposes that it's been harvested in new hampshire for hundreds of years  you would use it for creating energy  well  these are the kinds of new jobs that we need to be looking for across our country  i also believe we have to invest in  st century infrastructure we need to compete  i also believe we have to invest in  st century infrastructure to compete  let's set a goal of putting high speed internet access through broadband or wireless within the reach of every single american so that people throughout this state and every other one will be able to participate in the global economy  in new york  as a senator  i've done a lot of work trying to work with chambers of commerce and others to create zones for access to high speed internet  because it was difficult to attract jobs to the adirondacks or to other areas of rural new york without having that  we haven't had much help from the federal government  but i've been introducing legislation every since i arrived in the senate to do just that  just as we had a railroad system that connected our country  an electrification system  an interstate highway system  an airport system  we have to have a broadband system i also am not giving up on manufacturing  i believe we can still have a vibrant manufacturing base  with the right policies  it provides an immediate laboratory for innovation and a challenging feedback loop for engineers  designers and dreamers  it's an invaluable training ground for a new generation of entrepreneurs and leaders  that's why i helped to start the senate manufacturing caucus  where i've worked to develop a manufacturing strategy that will be suitable with the challenges of the  st century  i also founded a group called new jobs for new york  a unique non profit that harnesses the ingenuity  entrepreneurship and hard work of new yorkers  and i want to do that across our country  you know  we've been able to show companies in new york they didn't need to leave our country in order to get qualified people to do the work  we also commissioned a study which proved the cost of moving jobs to other countries is a lot greater than people actually understand or realize  so there's a lot we can do to give us a source of new jobs and to have an innovation agenda that will make us competitive going forward  we can't do it if we just accept the republican policies or if we just believe america's best days are over  you know  a lot of people around the world are writing america off  they do believe our best days are behind us  i could not disagree more  i believe america can rebound from these last six years  i believe we can restore fairness and ensure that all share in our prosperity  i believe we can reduce the deficit and restore fiscal responsibility and give people the education and opportunities they need to fulfill their god given potentials  i'm running for president because i believe if we set big goals and we work together to achieve them  we can restore the american dream today and for the next generation  the core ideals of a  st century progressivism are simple  the foundation of a strong economy is the investments we make in each other  in education  health care  clean energy and new technologies  greatness comes from policies that promote prosperity and ensure we all share in it  now  living up to these ideals and changing the political makeup will not be easy  but i'm absolutely confident we can do it  and i would just close by thinking of that great granite stater daniel webster  he said it years ago when he urged us to  develop the resources of our land  call forth its powers  build up its institutions  promote all its great interests and see whether we also  in our day and generation  may not perform something worthy to be remembered  i'm confident we have the discipline  the determination and the drive that we will not be the first generation in american history to leave our country worse off than when we found it  but we will continue  as every generation has before  to create much that is worthy to be remembered  we will restore fairness and responsibility to our economy  rebuild our middle class and rise to the challenges of this new global century  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", " toward a new american security  is exactly the right title for this forum  we are in a moment of profound change and challenge that requires new thinking and a new direction  as americans we bear much responsibility for the global economic  technological  and democratic revolution we are experiencing every day the world grows smaller and history moves faster  decisions by a factory owner in china impact the health and safety of children in chicago  american researchers use the web to share best practices   but so do islamist extremists  and pandemics do not know where evil nations end and good nations begin  a fact that i'm sure greatly disturbs the vice president  amidst the global transformation to an interdependent world our nation confronts possibilities of promise and peril  we know the current security policy with its excessive reliance on unilateral force  its rejection of international agreements of all kinds  and its preference for policy making based on ideology  not evidence  has to change  but let's begin with some basic assumptions rooted in reality  in this interdependent world  the united stated cannot unilaterally kill  jail  occupy or isolate all of our actual or potential adversaries  therefore  while a strong military remains essential to our security  it is not sufficient  moreover  there are few security challenges we can meet entirely on our own  so in the words of secretary albright   we should cooperate with others whenever we can and act alone only when we have to  not the other way around  when i was first lady  i was honored to visit   countries representing our nation  i witnessed the promise of america in the eyes of men  women and children  america represented hope  opportunity  freedom  as a united states senator i continue to meet with leaders from around the globe and as a member of the senate armed services committee  travel to places where our military has been engaged and performing heroically  and what we have seen here and around the world is that the administration has systematically broken down and thrown aside our hard won partnerships and alliances and undermined our greatest asset  america's moral authority   not just destroying the work of the previous decade but the difficult work of more than a half century of internationalism practiced by democratic and republican administrations alike  all too often the administration has favored ideology over reality  promoted tough talk over tough decisions  and sown alienation instead of cooperation  the next president will take office at a time when the united states faces the greatest confluence of challenges in our country's recent history  we must regain our place in the world with a new security policy that serves our national interest  recaptures our moral authority  works with our allies  modernizes our military  and confidently projects our values  in short  we must rebuild our strength and widen and deepen its scope  we have to be both internationalists and realists  we have to renew those alliances around the world  around a common set of goals including combating genocide  expanding human rights  promoting reconciliation through diplomacy  stopping nuclear proliferation  and addressing global warming  we have to realize that we are in the middle of a sectarian civil war in iraq and that it is well past time to start withdrawing our troops in the middle of that war  and we must also realize that the global threat of terror demands that we secure our home front  take on the terrorist networks abroad  and combat a false doctrine of hate  death and destruction  america must be the world's leader and yet we cannot lead unless we restore the greatness and goodness of america in the eyes of the world  that's why we must stand for freedom and fairness  justice and progress  peace and security  let me say a few words about iraq  i know that cnas has released a new report on iraq with a set of proposals for the way forward  i have some differences with the specifics of the proposal  but i believe it is time to end the war and bring our troops home as soon as possible  the failed ideology and flawed decision making that led us into iraq has had a devastating impact on us here at home and around the world  iraq continues to steal young american lives and to consume   billion a month  sapping our military readiness and standing  i traveled to iraq three times to meet with soldiers and commanders as well as the iraqi political leaders  there is no doubt that our military has performed heroically and has done what they were asked to do according to the authorization that was passed nearly five years ago  not a day goes by that i don't think of our men and women who are over there right now  patrolling the streets of baghdad  mosul  and other places  trapped by a failed strategy and sectarian civil war and i never stop thinking about the lives that have been lost and the lives that have been so drastically affected by profound injuries  the president claims he listens to our military commanders   but he apparently doesn't hear what i have heard for several years now  general petraeus  general casey  general pace  general abizaid  admiral fallon and others have told him and us  there is no military solution to the iraq conflict  only a political one  without concerted u s led international political and diplomatic efforts  as the iraq study group supported but the bush administration disregards  any iraqi government is condemned to failure  in the absence of credible and strong incentives backed by u s  pressure  the iraqi government has degenerated into protecting ethnic and sectarian interests  in the absence of sustained diplomatic efforts involving the parties affected and the nations in the region  we risk the expansion of the conflict beyond the borders of iraq  the coalition building efforts during the first gulf war and affecting the former yugoslavia demonstrate that sustained political and diplomatic efforts are critical to establishing and maintaining u s  national security interests  what worked for the first bush administration and the clinton administration has been abandoned or executed poorly  it is not a matter of partisanship  it is a matter of learning from lessons of successful american statesmanship of both democratic and republican presidents  the catalog of misjudgments offends common sense and shocks the conscience  the unilateral decision to rush to war without allowing inspectors to finish their work or diplomacy to run its course  the failure to send enough troops and the disgraceful lack of equipment for those we sent  the draining of manpower  resources and intelligence capabilities from afghanistan  the inability to stop rioting or to secure weapons caches  dismantling iraq's security and governmental capacity  the ignorance of a rising insurgency  and the adherence  which continues to the present day  to a broken policy more than four years after the invasion began  since   i've called for the strategic redeployment of u s  forces out of iraq  i've introduced the iraq troops protection and reduction act to begin withdrawing our troops  and i continue to press for a basic three step approach that would end the war while preserving our security interests  first  start bringing the troops home now  second  demand  and back up those demands  that the iraqis take responsibility for their country or lose the aid we are providing them  and third  begin intensive regional and international diplomacy on a sustained basis  we need to force the administration to change its failed policies in iraq  that's why i've gone further and with senator robert byrd proposed de authorizing the war by october     the five year anniversary of the original use of force resolution  senator byrd and i plan to offer an amendment de authorizing the war when the senate considers the defense authorization bill after the july  th recess  it's a civil war in iraq and we must extricate ourselves from it  i've also called on both the secretary of defense  secretary gates  and general pace  to brief congress on the existing plans for the withdrawal of us troops from iraq or to explain why no such detailed plans exist  the seeds of many problems that continue to plague our troops and mission in iraq were planted in a failure to adequately plan for the conflict that the administration was so anxious to begin  we cannot allow our failures in deploying into iraq to be repeated when we redeploy out of iraq  among the most important reasons for extricating ourselves from iraq are the looming challenges in the region and around the world to our national security  there is a global threat of terrorism and we have to confront it  here  too  the policies of the bush administration have set us back  america must rely on the intelligence of our allies along with our own  yet the bush administration's policies have alienated our friends and emboldened our enemies  new threats require us to modernize and reform our intelligence services  and we find ourselves often trapped in very short sighted  unproductive debates triggered by the president's and vice president's desire to expand executive authority beyond any previously imagined limit  it is dangerous for us to be caught up in debates about wiretapping schemes and it is dangerous for the administration to refuse to disavow torture  we are in a long term struggle in which our values must be more than rhetoric  but we are weakened by guantanamo and abu ghraib and by this administration's policies on detainees and torture  i voted against the military commissions act because i believe we have to stand for the rule of law before the world  especially when we are under threat  democrats and republicans alike believe that terrorists have to be caught  captured  sentenced  punished  killed  i believe there should be no mercy for those who perpetrated   and other crimes against humanity  but in the process of accomplishing what is essential for our security we must hold onto our values and set an example we can point to with pride and not shame  the bill allowed the admission into evidence of statements derived from cruel  inhumane  and degrading interrogations  will our enemies be less likely to surrender  will informants be less likely to come forward  will our soldiers be more likely face torture themselves if captured  will the information we obtain be less reliable  as lieutenant  general  john f  kimmons  the army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence has said   no good intelligence is going to come from abusive interrogation practices  allowing coercive treatment and torturous actions toward prisoners violates the rule of law  fails in intelligence gathering  and promotes radicalization  al zawahri  osama bin laden's second in command  the architect of many of the attacks on our country  throughout europe and the world has said over and over again if we would only pay attention   it is on their websites   that torture helps the cause of extremism  watering the seeds of jihad  i've called for the closing of the prison at guantanamo bay because it represents in the eyes of the world abuse  secrecy  and contempt for the rule of law  rather than keeping us more secure  guantanamo is harming our national security  it compromises our long term military and strategic interests and impairs our standing overseas  we also cannot allow the failures taking place in iraq to cause us to lose focus on the war in afghanistan  the first time i visited afghanistan in   a young soldier said to me   welcome to the forgotten front line of the war against terror  this administration is not only failing in iraq  its inattention risks failure in afghanistan  during my visit to afghanistan last january  i heard disturbing reports about continued cross border infiltration from pakistan into afghanistan by taliban and al qaeda fighters  the tensions between the afghan and pakistani governments were palpable  during my meetings with president karzai and president musharraf  i asked if they thought that a special presidential envoy from the united states would help them resolve their disputes and they both expressed the belief that such an envoy could be very useful  when i returned to the united states  i called the white house to suggest a special envoy and to convey the reactions of presidents karzai and musharraf  the white house  however  did not follow up on this idea and the tensions between those two critical countries continue unabated  we must widen the scope of our strength by leading strong alliances which can apply military force when required and promote our values  in the  's people were looking toward america for leadership  when ethnic cleansing was taking place in the balkans  the united states led our european allies in putting together a coalition to stop it  there is no better way to combat anti americanism than to do our best to demonstrate that america is invested in lifting up people around the world  some of you have heard this before  but it was striking to me that after president bush asked his father and my husband to represent our country with respect to the relief following the tsunami   they traveled together  they were there when our military was evacuating people and bringing in supplies   and the public opinion about the united states increased dramatically in a positive direction based on that very visible show of american concern  most notably in indonesia where there had been tracking of public attitudes toward us before and after  instability and extremism fester in places where infrastructure  education  and opportunity are also lacking  i've introduced the education for all act to provide   billion over five years toward the goal of basic education for every boy and girl around the world  from pakistan to sudan  parents want their children to have an education  but too often governments fail in delivering that basic service or find themselves without the resources to do so even if they are willing  education is a tool to combat hiv aids  empower women  and certainly for economic development  and i believe all of that plays to our strengths  for six years  the threat of terror at home has not been met successfully with a lot of bluster and intimidation  that only isolates us  it's not right and it's not smart  the attacks which have been prevented are a result of cooperation with other nations in intelligence  law enforcement and money tracking efforts  and those kinds of cooperative relationships have to be deepened and strengthened  alliances are also essential in safeguarding against other security threats like pandemics  be they acts of terrorism or acts of god  and there needs to be better cooperation globally for us to be prepared to deal with these kinds of threats  i think it's important that we also focus on the most significant threat of all  nuclear proliferation  the   public discourse project  an outgrowth of the   commission  argued that  preventing terrorists from gaining weapons of mass destruction must be elevated above all others problems of national security because it represents the greatest threat to the american people  we wouldn't know it by the discussion and dialogue in this city  the bush administration has joined the chorus saying that  yes  that is our biggest threat  unfortunately  their response has foundered at a nexus of ideology and intransigence  they have followed a policy that permitted north korea  whose plutonium production was frozen by the last administration  to reprocess enough material in the last four years to make half a dozen nuclear bombs and test a nuclear weapon  in the past few months we've seen signs of reversal  but the damage is already done  iran  meanwhile  has been given six years of the silent treatment  in this vacuum  iran continues its progress toward developing nuclear weapons and increasing its influence in the region  after initial talks with iran and syria on iraq  the administration says it isn't sure that we need any more discussions with either of them  i think we should keep talking  rather than engaging those who seek to develop nuclear weapons and working more urgently with allies to secure the nuclear material that al qaeda and others covet  the administration has abandoned the comprehensive test ban treaty and neglected non proliferation and even promoted two new small nuclear weapons  including the robust nuclear earth penetrator  the so called bunker buster  i'm introducing the nuclear terrorism prevention act  a bill based on the report published by the nuclear threat initiative  headed by senator sam nunn  he clearly sees this threat  outrunning our response  and my bill seeks to reinvigorate and accelerate our efforts to ensure that the nature and urgency of our response is commensurate with the threat  my legislation would first devote real resources to combating the threat by increasing funding for the global threat reduction initiative to convert research reactors around the world from highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium and to remove the highly enriched uranium from such facilities  i was with warren buffett last night who has pledged   million of his own money to this effort and believes that he could amass an even greater amount of money from the private sector if our government would lead us with some urgency toward taking on this challenge  we need to expand the materials protection  control and accounting program to lock down nuclear material and invest in forensic measures which advance our ability to discover the origins of a nuclear weapon in the horrific event of an attack  this legislation would also require the president to work to create specific international guidelines to raise the security standards at foreign nuclear sites  to paraphrase harvard's graham allison   no access to nuclear materials means no nuclear terrorism  third  to coordinate these efforts  my legislation would create a senior advisor to the president for the prevention of nuclear terrorism  responsible for an annual report to congress listing all sites worldwide with nuclear weapons and weapons usable fissile material and for developing and coordinating the implementation of a plan to eliminate  remove and secure all such material  here  too  we will never be served by policies that isolate us from those who can be our allies in stopping proliferation  and i hope that we will turn to this with greater urgency now  we cannot wait   months for the next administration  we should be focused on doing as much as possible as quickly as we can  there are so many other challenges across the board from obviously the middle east to latin america  from the ongoing israeli palestinian conflict to the ongoing violence in darfur  the next president will face a rising china with growing economic  diplomatic and military power  china is using its power throughout the world in new ways that challenge our current thinking and policies  we should neither fear a stronger china nor ignore it  that means engagement and understanding  but also frank dialogue on issues ranging from trade to currency manipulation to human rights abuses and the environment  i remember traveling to china in   to represent the united states at the fourth world conference on women  shortly before the conference was to start  the chinese government imprisoned a dissident   as some of you might remember   and many felt that we shouldn't go in order to send a strong message of disapproval  but i thought we should send another message  that's why i did go and spoke out about the importance of human rights and particularly emphasizing the importance of women's rights  i don't think we lose by speaking out and engaging with those with whom we disagree  even in profound ways  latin america presents another challenge  and  again  i think we have ignored developments in latin america at our peril  the president came into office with great promise but unfortunately it has not been realized  and we must redouble our efforts to create better ties and look for specific projects of development that can perhaps make a difference  the clinton foundation just announced a   million fund to do just that in latin america  working for sustainable development and working to train people to do jobs connected with sustainable development  finally  we face serious challenges in africa  in sudan  zimbabwe and other countries long term conflicts  external and internal  persist  certainly in the horn of africa we see islamist extremists attempting to lay down roots  and we are watching the chinese gain influence  building soccer stadiums and parliament buildings  the pentagon is creating a separate command for africa  and i fully support that  but they're having a problem figuring out where to place it  because the countries of north africa are not welcoming us the way that i believe they would have at a previous period  we've seen what happens when we fail to focus on africa  the genocide in darfur is a prime example  the united nations must do more to hold its member countries responsible for meeting basic human rights standards  and the united states must do more to create an environment in which countries are willing to place their resources at the disposal of the mission to end genocide  we've got to look for ways that we can create these opportunities within darfur  if sudan does not live up to its commitment to allow a full hybrid u n  and african union peacekeeping force  we should work with nato to take military action  i would suggest a no fly zone that would be blanketed over darfur and be focused on the air support that the sudanese provide to the janjaweed as they rape and pillage their way through the villages   the bombing comes before  during and after  and i think it is time for us to make a much more serious effort both to support the troops on the ground with airlift and logistics  and to have the threat of the no fly zone and action taken against those who violate it  in order for this new effort that the u n  and the a u  are proceeding with to be successful  but there are some good news stories in africa that we've got to do more to support  and i particularly am pleased about liberia  we've seen the very impressive presidency of president ellen johnson sirleaf  her commitment to good governance has served as a real example  we have supported debt relief for liberia  and the congress is passing that insofar as the american portion of it  but we've got to do more to help the country rebuild  and to try to create some examples of good governance and positive development in africa with our help  and  of course  there's global warming  a particular challenge that has security implications  eleven retired three  and four star admirals  and generals  including general zinni  had come out with a report entitled   national security and the threat of climate change  it concluded that global warming did present a serious national security threat because of its projected impacts on reduced access to fresh water and impaired food production  the displacement of populations  the mass migrations that will occur  the failed states  the conflicts over scarce resources  i authored an amendment for the defense authorization bill to implement many of the recommendations of this report  it is not the first one  the pentagon actually did their own report  several years ago  which never saw the light of day to any great extent  and it is time that we clearly focus on global warming as a security challenge  finally  there is a challenge we face right here at home in trying to figure out how to rebuild our military and transform our government to face the threats of the  st century and to take advantage of the opportunities  i'm a member of the transformation advisory group  which is a part of the u s  joint forces command  i was asked to join several years ago  it's a unique advisory group  charged with thinking of new ideas to move our military and government into a more forward leaning  forward thinking posture  and it's important that we look at the lessons from this group's discussion  that it's not just about what the military can and must do  but how the rest of the government has to be value added and work together in a much more coordinated way  our increasingly interconnected world demands an interconnected strategy that takes into account political  economic  diplomatic and military concerns  when developing military strategy  our military leaders no longer speak of the battlefield  but they talk about the situation  they are much more adept than many people actually understand  that the battlespace goes far beyond the battlefield  and we need that kind of multidimensional thinking  both inside and outside the walls of the pentagon  so let's make an effort to increase the number of soldiers proficient in foreign languages  instead of kicking out interpreters who happen to be gay  let's be sure our policies reflect concern for the will of governments and the perceptions of peoples  let's make sure that we look just not at the quadrennial defense review but at a document that looks at all of the government's responses to the threats and opportunities we face  you know  despite the professed attempts at military transformation  much more needs to be done  we do need to increase the size of the army to address the myriad threats that we still face  even after we begin withdrawing from iraq  we need to reform the pentagon's acquisition system to rein in the costs of weapons systems and spending on outside contractors  and we need to find the right mix between legacy systems that our service members are currently using and newer programs that will allow us to keep our technological edge our experiences in iraq and afghanistan mean that we must not just learn but incorporate the lessons of asymmetric warfare and train and equip our forces accordingly finally  we need to re evaluate the entire training and education that service members need in the  st century  every challenge we face begins with the biggest challenge  restoring our leadership by once again valuing alliances  respecting our values  and understanding that american strength is more than just a show of force  i want to end with a story that i particularly like  in part because it really does remind me of all that america can be when we have leadership that understands all that america should be  it's a story that secretary albright has told  back in   she was asked to go to europe to commemorate the  th anniversary of the end of world war ii  and she was particularly excited about going because she would go to the czech republic  having been born and raised in the former czechoslovakia and having confronted nazism and communism through her family  so as she traveled around to these various commemorations  she noticed people waving american flags  but as she looked more closely  she realized those flags had only   stars  and she kept asking people   where did these flags come from  and everyone told her the same thing  when the american g i s liberated europe  they passed out these flags  and people had treasured them  passing them on from grandparent to parent to child  and  in fact  keeping them at some risk to themselves  because if they'd been discovered under soviet occupation with an american flag  they could have gotten into trouble  so she asked them   why did you keep these flags for fifty years  and everyone said the same thing  because they loved america and they loved the hope that those flags represented and the values that stood behind them  well  i want to see a restoration of those feelings about us around the world  but i also want to see their restoration here at home  we have to begin believing again in our goodness and our greatness  in our ability to be both smart and tough  you know    years ago this month  president kennedy spoke just a short distance from where we are today at american university  and he said   i speak of peace because of the new face of war  in this new century  we are confronted by yet another new face of war and a new reality of global interdependence  it is a moment of peril and of promise  how we proceed is entirely up to us  we can repair the damage that has been done to our security and our standing over these past six years  we can rebuild our alliances and restore our moral authority  and reestablish our leadership in the world  and by doing so  we can forge a new american security for this new century  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", "sen  clinton  good morning  it is an absolute delight to be with you this morning for this very important conference  i want to thank mark for the wonderful job that he is doing here at the urban league  and for his strong leadership on so many issues  i also want to recognize and thank the entire urban league board and the staff  who have put this together and have labored hard to make sure that it was a productive and important event  not just for the national urban league  but for all of us i want to recognize st  louis' mayor  mayor slay  delighted you're here for this important occasion  and other elected officials who are in the audience  now there are two people who are not here  who i would be remised if i did not mention  i would hear about it from one  and that is our old friend vernon jordan  who said   you went all the way to st  louis and you didn't event mention me  so vernon  wherever you are  we're thinking of you  and we're grateful to you for your lifetime of service  another who i want to honor by remembering him  is ron brown  someone who served our country so well  and whom we miss  his brand of leadership and good humor in the face of challenge is always timely and we certainly could use more of it today  and george  thank you for keeping the trains running on time  and finally  i want to thank all of you for ninety seven years of service  when i think of the national urban league  i think of the people whom i've known  the projects that i've partnered on  but according to a recent study by dr  silas lee  who i'm very proud to say is one of my pollsters and given me great advice  and dr  bernard anderson  who served as assistant secretary of labor during my husband's administration  according to their study between   and   the urban league contributed more than   billion to america's economy  and not only that  in   more than   million people were directly and indirectly served through the publications  the seminars  the advocacy and service projects undertaken by the urban league  that is an extraordinary achievement   and it's one that's not often recognized  people don't realize that non profits  like the urban league  are drivers of economic progress  and i want to thank you  not only for the good work you do  but for the economic impact that work has  i also want to really express my gratitude for this opportunity to continue the conversation that the urban league is leading in our cities  and to fully endorse your opportunity compact   it is a set of priorities which i strongly support built on   cornerstones that every american should be able to agree to  the opportunity to thrive  the opportunity to earn  the opportunity to own  and the opportunity to prosper   that's a pretty good definition of the american dream in my book  because i don't have as much time as i would love for this conversation   i could be up here for hours with all of you  and loving to hear back from you   i want to focus on one aspect of this conversation   and that is an issue highlighted in the opportunity compact  highlighted in your state of black america report  and recently in the dellums commission  and that is the crisis of   million young men of color between the ages of   and     they are out of school and out of work  that includes nearly one out of every three young african american men  young men who are not earning legal wages or learning marketable skills  over half growing up in homes without fathers  a third wind up in the criminal justice system  nearly   each year are claimed by guns or violence before their  th birthdays  now i don't know about you  but i feel like i've been listening to this conversation all my life  and i firmly believe it is the wrong conversation  i reject it  i reject a conversation about   million young men as a threat  as a headache  or as a lost cause  i reject the conversation about   million disappointments  failures  and casualties of a broken system  that is not who these young men are  i believe it is long past time for a new and different conversation  it is time for america to begin a conversation about   million future workers  entrepreneurs  tax payers  community leaders  business executives  a conversation about   million future husbands and fathers and role models  a conversation about   million boys who have the god given potential to grow into strong  proud  loving  decent  productive  accomplished men with our help and support  that is the conversation i want to have with you and america  and that is the conversation i want to take with me into the white house in january   to put forth an agenda to finish the job  it's time  america  for a change  and i have seen the potential  as a young lawyer right out of law school  i didn't want to go to wall street firms  i didn't want to clerk for a judge  all i wanted to do was to work for marian wright edelman at the children's defense fund  that was my goal  i had met her  she had gone to yale law school about   years before me  she was legendary with her work in mississippi on behalf of civil rights and the naacp legal defense fund  i heard she was speaking at yale  i went to introduce myself to her during my very first year in law school  heard her speak  was galvanized  went up to her and said   i want to work for you  and she said   well  that's nice  but i can't pay you  and i said   well  that's a problem because i'm working my way through law school  so i have to get paid  and she said   if you can figure out how to get yourself paid  you can come work for me  so applied for and i received a law student's civil rights research council internship  which paid me to be able to go and do the work that has been the passion and calling of my life through my years of public service  and now my years in public office  and i remember very well one of the first assignments that marian gave me was to go to a couple of states and find out if we could stop them from jailing children with adults  and then to go door to door and ask people if they had children who weren't in school  because back in those days children were kept out of school for all kinds of reasons  some of them had physical ailments  some of them had behavioral problems  some of them had to help support their families  so i have been focused on what we need to do to help children succeed  and i have to tell you in all my   years as an advocate for children and families  i have never met a child without potential  and these   million young men are no different  and when we write them off and leave them behind   when we squander their potential   we squander america's potential  and that is nothing short of a moral crisis  but let's be clear  this is not just a moral crisis   it is an economic crisis  and it's not just an urban economic crisis  it is not just an african american economic crisis  it is an american economic and moral crisis  and when we let these young boys and men fall through the cracks  we make a decision to spend   billion a year on prisons  now we may not draw the connection all the time  but you and i know that's the decision we're making  we have decided that we're going to spend poorly  instead of spending it smartly  right now  across america  jobs are going empty because companies can't find trained  skilled employees to fill them  so ultimately  the crisis of young men of color is a national crisis  and when i'm president  i will call for a national response   and a national commitment   to address it  i will call everyone to the table  one of the that things i really believe in  is getting everybody out there together  and rolling up our sleeves  and starting to act like americans again  we're the people who are supposed to be the problem solvers  we're not supposed to stand on the sidelines  wringing our hands talking about how terrible things are  we're supposed to be working together to solve problems  and i want state and local governments  universities  businesses  unions  non profits  churches  individuals  and i'm going ask one simple question   what will you do   not what you'll talk about   but what will you do  not another report  but what will you do in order to deal with this crisis  i am not going to accept half steps or piecemeal measures as an answer  we need a smart  bold  daring  comprehensive approach  one based on the fundamental premise that these young men are all our children  all of our responsibility  because after all these years  i still believe it takes a village to raise a child  so  that is why today  i am announcing my youth opportunity agenda   which goes hand in hand with the opportunity compact  this is my plan  as your president  to build that village  an america where every child is valued for his or her god given potential  and where all of us  from our families to our communities to our country  resolve to do whatever we can to help each child realize that potential  now  i believe the initiative has to start from day one   the very day a child is born   with early interventions to help that child get on the right path  that's why  as president  i'm going to focus like a laser on those early years  and it's not just focusing on the children  let's focus on the parents and the grand parents  and the aunts and the uncles  and the brothers and the sisters  we know what works  i've been doing this for   years  i started off at the yale child studies center  i've done it through arkansas  and when i was privileged to work in the white house for my husband  and now in the senate  we know what works  let's take these proven programs like nurse home visitation programs  where we send in qualified nurses and social workers and others to go in and help these young mothers and fathers understand what they need to do for their children  let's emphasize a program i helped to start during the  's   the early head start program  let's expand and build on head start   a proven success  and finally  i have made a commitment to universal pre kindergarten for every four year old   access to quality  affordable early learning when it really can make a difference in the lives of these children  an astonishing fact  not from me because i believe this based on all the work i've done  but james heckman  noble prize winning economist from the university of chicago  hardly thought to be a hotbed of fuzzy thinking and liberal thought  he did a study  and he concluded that if we had universal pre kindergarten  we would close by   the achievement gap between white and black children  just with that early investment  children will stay in school longer  they'll do better  let's make that one of our priorities  second  once our children start school  we have to provide early mentoring and support to keep them on the path to success  it is not enough to give young men of color a chance to succeed  if then after they've started down this long and difficult path we step off of it  we need to be holding hands moving forward together  we know that many young men drop out of school  did you know that a child in america drops out of school every   seconds  many don't make it through high school  some don't make it through junior high school  that's why  as president  i will expand programs like gear up that intervene in middle school to provide mentoring and tutoring  i want college visits to help young people understand this can be part of their future  programs like the hillside work scholarship connection   created with the help of the rochester urban league in rochester  new york   that develops individualized college and career success plans for middle school students and gives these students a job  gives them a job after school  during vacations because they have to be exposed to the culture of work and learn all those habits and that discipline  and it has proven to be a great success  i also want to see schools like eagle academy in new york  in the bronx  i was honored to help start this charter school with the one hundred black men in new york  i think david banks  who was the principal  is here  we need a thousand of eagle academies for young men of color  where they feel accepted  supported  mentored and helped  i want to use a mentorship model that will reach an additional one million students  my administration will provide   million over five years to establish internship opportunities that will match students with businesses  with unions  with non profits like the urban league to provide the training they need to thrive in professional environments  this isn't just a chance to enrich our children  it's not a corporate charity program  we have to give both sides of the equation   the young men and the employer   a chance to discover and develop each other  and to have then  an opportunity waiting for that young person  the third part of my agenda involves building comprehensive  community based programs to reach out to young people who are failing to thrive  programs that don't just keep them from falling through the cracks   but actually start filling in the cracks  i'm going to ask our mayors and other local leaders to gather with representatives from across the community to develop such programs  now  that might mean creating one stop youth centers like those in baltimore and los angeles where case managers work to connect young people with tutoring  job training  and other support services  it might mean strengthening alternative education and career academies  apprenticeships and skills training  i had a visit from the new york auto dealers a year or two ago  they said   senator  we have   jobs that we can't get filled for auto mechanics  these are jobs in new york starting at   where do we go to find such people  well  to their credit  they started a school  but we need to have more partnerships like that  i'm talking about programs that give young people the skills and confident they need to compete for the high tech  ast century jobs  because one of the reasons those auto mechanic jobs are harder to fill is because you have to know about computers  it's no longer a low skill job  it's a high skill job with a very good salary  programs like focus hope in detroit that train young people to fill the   machinist jobs opening up each year in that city  programs like year up that give young people the skills to land good financial services jobs in downtown providence  rhode island  programs that train students for new  renewable energy  green collar  jobs  youthbuild  which have been putting our young people to work   they're beginning to train young people to do this and i have a program that will create   jobs of people that can't be outsourced  if we're going to start getting serious about alternative energy and do things like solar  somebody's got to climb up there and put that solar panel on the roof  we're going to create millions of jobs if we do this right and a lot of them will be in the inner cities  we also need to make sure our young people can get these jobs in the first place  yes there are problems because of low education and low skills  lack of mentoring and networks  but let's be frank here  some of those problems that stand in the way of young people and jobs is because of discrimination  plain and simple  which brings me to my fourth point  a recent study showed that when employers were presented   i'm almost done  mark  but you know i'm just fired up about this you can't stop me now  a recent study showed that when employers were presented with similarly qualified white and black applicants  they were twice as likely to hire the white applicants  they even hired white applicants with criminal records at the same or higher rates than black applicants  so we're going to get back to a justice department and a civil rights division that actually enforces the laws  and finally  we have got to tackle two remaining problems  first  how do we help these young men be responsible fathers  we've got to reverse president bush's dramatic cuts in child support enforcement  we've got to make sure that every dollar goes to the children who need it  we've got to make sure that the young men have the money to pay the child support which means raising the minimum wage again  and we have to confront the devastating impact of the criminal justice system  the brutal revolving door has already claimed so many young lives  and i want to have a second change program that really focuses on how we're going to keep our young people out of the criminal justice system  and how we're going to rehabilitate then and give them a new chance when they come out  so  i know this is not going to be easy  but i am up for it if you are  i am confident and optimistic we can make this happen together  now there will be all the naysayers who say   oh my goodness we can't do it  politics is so hard  well  we can't listen to them james baldwin once said   those who say it can't be done are usually interrupted by those who are doing it  and so we got to get about the business of doing it  let me tell you that if we work together  if we elect a president who cares passionately about our young people  understands what it will take to make the opportunity compact real in their lives  we're going to see change in america  i want to be your partner  i look forward to working with you  let's go out and make it happen  thank you all  and god bless you "], ["clinton", "i'm honored to have the keychain   actually the keychain is pretty useful  i will be a proud user of that  and i'm very grateful to the mayor and i appreciated his comments because i think what he said really set the stage for what i want to talk to you about this morning  it is a problem that has literally affected our entire countryof course we were watching the news this past week with a heavy heart at the sight of that broken bridge and those submerged cars and the grieving families and the heroic rescue and recovery efforts that are still ongoing  and i know that our thoughts and prayers are with everyone who was touched by this terrible accident  there may be nothing that we individually can do to try ease the pain and the difficulties that the bridge collapsing has caused the people of the twin cities area  but there is a great deal we can do as a nation to ensure that accidents like that don't happen in new hampshire and across america  this is a real wake up call  and over the last two years the mississippi river  that great river that goes down the middle of our country  first at its mouth  has reminded us of the importance of infrastructure with the collapse of the levies during katrina  and now at the near beginnings of the river  we've been reminded once again   we face an infrastructure crisis  i've been talking about and worrying about and working on infrastructure as a senator from new york for the past six and half years  it's not a subject that usually gets headlines  people know we have problems  but there's always something that seems more pressing for us to deal with  and as the mayor was so rightly saying  there are problems right here in rochester  there are problems throughout the state like there are in every other state  but unless it's a crisis  we don't really pay attention  well my point today is   it is a crisis  it's a silent crisis  it's a crisis with the potential of not only death and injury  property loss and other kinds of dangers and inconveniences  but it is imperative that we address this crisis for our economy and for the kind country we want to be in the  st century  every day  millions of americans inch their way through bumper to bumper traffic  they drive over structurally deficient bridges  millions board buses and subways which the federal department of transportation has deemed poor  substandard  or merely adequate  we get water from aging water pipes   some of the pipes in new york are over   years old  and because of the leaks the inevitably come from corrosion and other problems  they waste a billion  a billion and more gallons of water each month  they potentially expose our water   and i have to say new york city is consistently ranked among the very best in public water  so new york city does a great job  but any water system that has been there a long time  or hasn't been maintained  has the potential of exposing us to chemicals and toxins  and every single hour  our goods are shipped on under serviced  overburdened railways  we've had a rash of railway accidents in new york that i have followed very closely and worked both with the state and with the railroad companies to try and remedy  but derailments are becoming more and more common  goods travel through unprotected  overcrowded seaports or through waterways filled with broken locks  and we know all too well that the results can be tragic  not only bridge collapse in minneapolis and the levies collapse in new orleans  but the collapse of the big dig tunnel ceiling  and the highway overpass that collapsed last week in california  this is a wake up call that is screaming  it's like when you have an alarm clock and it gets increasingly louder because we don't want to hear it or we hit it because we want to get a few more minutes of sleep  well we've been asleep  and certainly what happened with katrina   which was a natural disaster that turned into a national disgrace and became international embarrassment and cost nearly   of our fellow citizens their lives  was the loudest of all wake up all calls  and keep in mind  the bridge in minnesota  that the mayor use to live near  was one of nearly   bridges across america   more than   of those bridges are in need of serious repair  something is very wrong when  at the dawn of the twenty first century  in the richest country on earth  people are actually nervous about driving over bridges for fear that they might collapse  or they're worried that their levees might burst  or their highways might buckle  and the degradation of our infrastructure isn't just a serious threat to our families' safety   it is a threat to our homeland security as well  more than five years after   we still have not secured our borders  our railways  our mass transit systems  our ports  our chemical plants  our nuclear facilities and more  and in addition  if we needed even more arguments about why we should act  in addition to threatening our safety and our homeland security   the problems with our infrastructure are also a grave threat to our economy  did you know that those hours we spend sitting in traffic cost as much as   billion a year in wasted time  fuel  productivity and damage to our environment  those railroads carry half of all freight not carried by air  those waterways carry roughly one sixth of our inter city freight  and those seaports are our gateway to international trade  when there are shutdowns or delays or a lack of capacity  america's businesses and workers pay the price  we don't always think about this  but i was listening to an npr report about the consequences of the collapse in minneapolis and there was a man who owned a trucking firm and he said the price of everything is going to rise  because we're going to spend more on fuel  because we have to take detours  and they began to talk about things we don't think about as consequences to the cost of the living and to the economy  in short  we're trying to run today's economy on yesterday's infrastructure   and we're jeopardizing tomorrow's prosperity  it's like trying to run a company today with typewriters  or mimeograph machines or rotary phones  if you're lucky  you might break even   but you sure don't expect to break much of a profit  the american society of civil engineers gives our dams a d  our power grid a d  our drinking water systems a d  our roads a d  i have to ask  do you really think america is really a country that is satisfied with ds on our report card when it comes to infrastructure  that's not the country i us grew up in  that's not the country i was raised to believe in and it's certainly not the country we want for our children  here in america  we've never been content to sit back and make do with what worked for our parents and grandparents and our great grandparents  when we've caught a glimpse of a new frontier   we've built the infrastructure to reach it  when we've discovered new opportunities   we've built the infrastructure to seize them  in america  our infrastructure has always been the engine of our aspirations  think back to the early  s  i just visited the portsmouth naval shipyard  it was started in   as many of you know  think about the audacity of this new country deciding they were going to build this shipyard  and they kept at it now for   years  think about early  s in new york  when the governor of new york   who happened to be named clinton   i like that too   persuaded the state legislature to construct a   mile canal connecting new york city to the west  now you can imagine that we had a lot of naysayers in the  s just like we do today   why are we building it  it costs too much money  it'll never work  if fact  the naysayers deemed the project  clinton's ditch  but here is what governor clinton said   the city will  in the course of time  become the granary of the world  the emporium of commerce  the seat of manufactures  the focus of great moneyed operations  and he was right  fifteen years later  the erie canal had made new york city america's busiest port  think about president lincoln  who decided to build the transcontinental railroad in the midst of the civil war  while he struggled to hold north and south together  he has the vision to lay the groundwork to connect east and west  the completion of the railroad reduced coast to coast travel time from months to just a week   and settlers flocked to the new frontier  or think about president eisenhower and his belief that   our unity as a nation is sustained by free communication of thought and by easy transportation of people and goods  today  we're still reaping the economic benefits of the interstate highway system he championed  now  these leaders and so many others understood that expanding our infrastructure was the key to expanding our economy  they knew we could start all the companies  and manufacture all the products  and grow all the food we wanted   but if we couldn't get the goods to the customers   if we couldn't get the workers to the jobs   the economy would never flourish  and today  that same understanding extends to everything we need to do in both our physical infrastructure and our virtual infrastructure  like expanding broadband the critical worldwide infrastructure of the modern global economy  now  we also know that investing in infrastructure creates jobs  the estimates are pretty reliable  for every   billion spent on fixing crumbling infrastructure creates nearly   jobs  but instead of investing in the infrastructure of the future and growing our economy  we continue to make do  we patch and repair  we ignore the advice of our engineers  economists  businesses  unions  community leaders  we try to build our children's future with our grandparents' infrastructure  and we are falling further and further behind  we don't need any more warnings  we don't need any more wakeup calls  it is time to stop wringing our hands   and start rolling up our sleeves and rebuild america  it's time to stop asking how we can afford to fix our infrastructure   and start asking how we can afford not to  it's time to ask ourselves  what if we could shave minutes   even hours   off our commutes  what if we could shave hours   even days   off our shipping times  what if our ports could send and receive tons of additional goods each week  safely  what if we had public transit system and a rail system that dramatically reduced our reliance on foreign oil  and our carbon dioxide emissions  and our smog and air pollution  well  i'm here today because i believe we can do all of these things  i consider myself a modern american progressive  and in the spirit of those early progressives   who were republicans as well as democrats  who i think put country before party  who made commitments to bring us together and work side by side   i think we can do this  and that's why i have been working as a senator and why i think it's imperative to make this a priority for my presidency  you know i've co sponsored  on a bipartisan  the national infrastructure improvement act of   with my colleague  senator voinovich from ohio  this act  because we couldn't get the kind of program we wanted  we set up a commission to ensure we got the data that would provide the basis for congress asking  with a new president who actually cared about our infrastructure  we want to know  can our infrastructure sustain economic growth for the twenty first century  we don't think so  how do we get adequate funding  obviously that's big unanswered question  how do we develop comprehensive recommendations   that instead of divvying up the money on political pork barrel spending  we do it on the basis of a real plan for america  this legislation has passed the senate  i'm hopeful that it will pass the house and i'm hopeful the president will sign it because that will give me the basis for what i want to do as president  i want to set big goals as your president  big goals  like universal health care  quality  affordable healthcare  i want to set a triple goal of moving us toward energy security and independence  dealing with global warming  and creating lots of jobs from dealing with energy and global warming  i want to end the iraq war and bring that money home  and in addition to all the other goals on education  and stem cell research and reforming our government  i want to make modernizing our nation's infrastructure  as the backbone of our prosperity  one of my goals as well  you know  every generation faces tough challenges and they require tough choices  we talk about the greatest generation of my father  my late father  because they survived the depression  they fought and kept our country going during world war ii  and they deserve our thanks  but at the very same time they were making commitments to a country that they believed in  and we have to ask ourselves  what commitments have we made  what have we done to sacrifice and share a burden that i think should be the responsibility of each american generation  the reality is that with what we've seen in minneapolis and new orleans it's hard to answer that question  that is why i'm going to challenge us  our generation and all of american  to stand up and fix our country   to rebuild the failing infrastructure of the  th century while we build the new digital and energy infrastructure of the  st century  it's going to take serious resources and a serious national commitment  it's going to take a national partnership among all levels of government and between the public and the private sector  it requires a smart  comprehensive plan  and it requires that we deal not only with repairing and expanding our infrastructure  but solving the problems that are created by infrastructure   you know  congestion  urban sprawl  environmental degradation  and that is what i want to talk with you about  my rebuild america plan   which will create millions of good new jobs  elevate our standard of living  and enhance our ability to compete in the world marketplace  i start with three emergency initiatives to help states and localities immediately review and repair critical infrastructure  and we've got to have the federal government at the table  i think we should provide   million in  emergency assessment grants  so that state cans pull together the information that is there  conduct any new assessments and inspections that they need to and give grants to prioritize what things they have to do and in what order  you know if everything's a priority  nothing gets done  if you set priorities  you can begin to assess them right away  at the same time  i'll invest   billion over ten years in an  emergency repair fund  to begin addressing the extensive backlog of emergency infrastructure repairs  right now    of our bridges are  functionally obsolete    meaning that they don't meet current transportation standards  they could go any time  another   are  structurally deficient    including that bridge in minnesota   meaning they're deteriorating and losing the capacity to sustain their loads  right here in new hampshire    of the   non covered state and local bridges are on the  red list  that means they're bridges of greatest concern  that includes the memorial bridge  which i just saw for myself today  in addition  today  nearly half the locks on our waterways are obsolete   that's a figure that if we do nothing could rise to   within the next   years  it's time that the federal commitment stepped up and addressed these deficiencies  now  states are already spending money on these projects  the federal government is also  but together  we're not spending enough  my fund will supplement what they're already doing  we know states  as the mayor alluded to  sometimes put off even starting certain repairs because they don't know where the money will come from to finish the repairs  one of the problems with the federal government is that we don't have a capital budget  that means we don't budget smartly for long term capital projects  if you're going to fix the levees in new orleans you've got know that's going to take a couple of years  if you're going to fix a lot of our infrastructure that's an investment you don't get done in one year but the way that our federal budget runs  we budget every year  and that is just a really foolish way if you're talking about getting the biggest return on your dollar  that's something that i will raise with the congress  we've tried it before  they aren't likely to respond very favorably because every year they get to make these decisions but we need a capital budget  that would help us set priorities for some very big projects and then see them through  i also believe it would save us money  because if we could actually plan for three to five years  we would have a much better way of controlling costs  so i hope that we'll consider that  but  my emergency repair fund will give states the predictability to get certain projects underway and then we can allocate over time and people shouldn't have to worry about that  we also need to upgrade the standards  that's why national academy of engineering and the national institute of standards and technology will be the institutions i ask to give me answers to two critical questions  one  i want them to review the safety certification process and standards currently in place  those standards may not be rigorous enough for heavy trucks or for increased traffic  you know when some of these bridges were built in the  s the projections for traffic and weight on them didn't take into account what are now doing    or   years later  two  we've got to set that priority list  and i want an independent group to do that  my second point in my plan to rebuild america involves investing an additional   billion in our intercity passenger rail system  which carries   million passengers a year  links more than   communities  connects communities with airports  city bus systems  providing additional convenience for passengers  and with gas price very unpredictable and traffic worse than ever  airline travel riddled with overbooking  overcrowding and delays   train travel is actually becoming increasingly appealing  but there's very little federal funding for these rail systems  they treat them as primarily a state responsibility and i think that's the wrong approach  train travel protects our environment  it reduces our dependence on foreign oil and helps alleviate congestion  one of the reasons that some of the asian countries and some of the european countries are really make progress against us economically is that they have heavy investments in trains  and those trains are high speed trains  they move quickly both people and goods and this should be a national priority  third  i think we also need to more to build up our intra city transportation systems   the subways and buses that comprise our public transit systems  in   americans took more than   billion trips on local public transportation  and those systems serve as a lifeline for so many low and middle income americans and for many senior citizens who are no longer able to drive  public transportation is also one of the best strategies for protecting the environment  believe it or not  emissions from road vehicles accounted for more than   of air pollution in america  if we just increased our public transportation from   to   we'd reduce our reliance on foreign oil by roughly   reduce carbon dioxide emissions by   and reduce smog causing nitrogen oxide emissions by about one third  but despite the benefits of public transit  today    of public transit spending goes toward maintaining existing capacity   only just   toward expanding our systems  i want to change that ratio  so i want to increase federal funding for public transit by   billion a year  i want to get those funds to communities committed to using them effectively   communities committed to avoiding sprawl by locating homes  jobs and stores nearby  reducing the need for unnecessary car trips  over the next   years  many of the buildings in which we live  work  and shop will be built or rebuilt  so today  we have a unique opportunity to encourage sustainable development  fourth  i want to work with state and local governments and the private sector to create a national policy to modernize our seaports  you know this is something sort of out of sight of mind  if you're not in a coastal state like new hampshire or new york  you don't think about seaports as much as we should  twenty six percent of our gross domestic product   and a growing share goes through our seaports    united states ports handled just   million containers   by   it was up to   million  by   we expect it to be   million  the ports simply are just not keeping up  many are running out of space  they are plagued by navigation channels that are too narrow  or harbors that are too shallow to accommodate larger ships  they don't have modern technology including  homeland security technology  yet there is not one  single federal agency responsible for our ports  so while ports are of national economic significance  responsibility for port funding has fallen primarily to state and local governments  that's why  we need to bring out ports into the  st century and work with our state and local governments  but have the federal government provide support to upgrade technology  expand capacity and reduce congestion  fifth  i will want to make it a national priority to confront the growing national problem of congestion  you know  right now  traffic has pretty much taken its place alongside death and taxes as one of those things you just can't avoid  and between   and   the amount of time americans spent in traffic delays increased more than     and gallons of fuel wasted increased nearly   if current trends continue  by   moderately dense areas will experience the same kind of traffic problems we see in gridlock in new york city or chicago or la  and the rise of communities that are further and further away means longer commutes  and when you think about wit the internet we need to be figuring out how to promote more telecommuting  i think we should of course increase what we do to be smart about congestion  but why can't we be smart about giving more people the opportunity to work from home  especially mothers who are balancing family and work   because right now we have good evidence that it's actually good for productivity but there's a reluctance to do it  that's true in government  that's true in the private sector and i think we need to support initiatives that promote telecommuting  maybe not five days a week  maybe three days a week but anything we can do to try to limit the traffic congestion actually increases productivity and helps our environment  i think that when we look at technology we don't realize that today we can collect real time information on road and travel conditions and we can actually detect traffic density and adjust their traffic signals and post the information on electronic road signs to warn drivers of congestion ahead  we can have more efficient electronic toll systems  and make sure that we have a good camera system high traffic areas to monitor accidents and speed the deployment of ambulances and tow trucks  san diego even has reversible toll lanes  so when traffic is much heavier in one direction than another  they can reverse a lane and ease the congestion  so let's use technology as our friend to get us out of these traffic jams that so many of us experience  and sixth  we need to make a serious commitment to modernizing our electric power system  the average power generating station in our country was built in the  s  today  interruptions   some of which are big enough that they really shut everything done  some of which are just sporadic and happen in certain areas   but interruption in our supply of electricity cost us roughly   billion a year  and yet  the electric industry devotes fewer dollars to research and development than the dog food industry  we had a brown out in queens  no body could figure what had happened  and it really interfered with a lot of people who lived in apartments with no operating elevator once the electricity went out  it really put a great burden on a lot of elderly people  a lot of small businesses lost refrigeration   floral shops  ice cream shops  and i went to visit some of my constituents to figure out what we were going to do about it and i was standing outside of a little restaurant that has lost thousands of dollars worth of food because of the shut down  and a gentleman came up to me and introduced himself  and he said to me  senator  i am from india  i never thought i would move to the united states and see electricity disruptions  and it really struck me  because we think of ourselves of being so far advanced of any other country  and yet we're not keeping that advantage  i think we can do better  that's why i sponsored the electric reliability act which has been signed into law  helping to give our federal government more authority to make our electricity system more reliable  this is a disaster waiting to happen  we've got an outdated grid  an outdated transmission and distribution system  nobody is responsible for investing in it and it is the lifeblood of how we power our economy  seventh  we need to dramatically increase our investments in broadband deployment  back in   america was fourth in the world in broadband access  today  we're  th  other countries are investing heavily in broadband to connect up their entire country  and i've have seen the power of broadband firsthand  in new york  we started a program where we brought together leaders from the business  non profit  university  banking  and computer technology communities   including e bay   to give local businesses the capital and technical assistance they needed to expand onto the internet  i did this because  any of you who have been up in the adirondacks up in northern new york know how beautiful it is  but we have a lot people who can't make a very good living because they don't have big market for their goods  and so we worked to put them on e bay and we proved that we could take somebody who was making fishing rods in northern new york  or making soap  and give them a global market place  now  i believe in markets     markets are one of the great advantages we have for making our economy dynamic  but when the market isn't working   when the companies are not wiring certain areas   either underserved urban areas or underserved rural areas   then the federal government has to step in with planning grants  and equipment grants  and tax incentives  that's what we had here with electricity  utilities didn't think it was possible to extend electricity to certain parts of our country  and so the federal government had to step in  and i think if we focus on expanding broadband and i've recently called for an innovation agenda to support state and local communities to expand and develop broadband  then we know we can make progress because information highways are to the  st what canals and railroads were to the  th century and interstate highways in the  th  eighth  and finally  we don't just need to build the broadband and electrical infrastructure of the  st century   we need to build the clean energy infrastructure as well  that's why i've proposed creating a  green buildings fund    a   billion investment in grants and low interest loans to states to improve energy efficiency in buildings  it'll help us cut pollution  combat climate change  and create thousands of jobs   what we can call  green collar jobs  i've sponsored legislation with my colleague  senator sanders of vermont  because we want to train people to do these jobs  investing in energy efficient infrastructure is one of the cheapest  cleanest  fastest ways we know to cut energy use and reduce emissions  in fact  the department of energy estimates that energy efficiency along  could cut national energy use by   percent in   years  it's a no brainer   which is slightly higher standard than the current one we have washington  this is an issue whose time has come  and i'm proud to co sponsor senator dodd and senator hagel's national infrastructure bank act that we just introduced to establish a federally backed independent bank that will evaluate and finance large infrastructure projects by subsidies  loan guarantees  and bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the united states  that's what our competitors are doing  they are on the march  you know japan  and china  and even india  and certainly europe  they are making progress and we are treading water and being swept backwards  now  will all this be easy  of course not  but i believe that it is imperative and it is truly one of the challenges that it is going to determine whether we're up to the task of remaining a great nation with the strongest middle class in the history of the world  and a rising standard of living and quality of life  i have faith that we will answer the call  a country that dug a   mile canal  by hand with only the help of mules  that built a railroad from one coast to the other   that connected communities across america with more than   miles of highway   that sent a man to the moon   that's who we are as americans  you know  one of the most discouraging aspects of the bush cheney administration is the way they have talked down america  they have been fatalistic  i reject that out of hand  we can do whatever we set our minds to  we can roll up our sleeves  we can be problem solvers again  and i have faith that we will answer that call  with your help we will rebuild america thank you very much "], ["clinton", "thank you  thank you all so much  and i would like to thank becky for being here and for chairing the democratic party in dallas county  its was wonderful becky  thank you so much we have a full house  some of you know  we were originally planning to do this in a slightly smaller setting  so there are one or two chairs left  but not very many  there are a couple up here for people standing in the back  i see three here  it is not like church where we are going to call you forward  we want to try to give you a char to sit in  i am thrilled to be here and there are a number of people who are with is that i would like to recognize starting with my great friends and your former governor and first lady tom and christie vilsack who are here  another great friend of mine who has been active in iowa and active on so many issues in washington for so many years on your behalf is ruth harkin  senator tom harkin's wife  i want to welcome the mayor  mayor peard  thank you very much for being here  i really appreciate you coming  i saw the state senator  staci apple come in  thank you so much staci for coming  and in a few minutes i'm going to introduce you to our very  very special guests who will talk about their own experiences concerning some of the issues that i want to raise today  so you will be hearing in a moment from pat twerpy  and mary rose brown  and i am very happy they are here because what they will talk about are issues that are affecting seniors and their families  but i want to start this morning by asking a few questions  how many of you are caring for an aging relative or know someone who is  you can raise your hand  and how many of you have every worried about whether social security and medicare will still exist when your children and your children and your grandchildren may need it  i think every hand went up on that one how many of you do not want to be a burden on your children either emotionally or financially when you retire or if you have already retired  yea lots of hands  my mother is   and let me tell you that is how she feels  now  i know that behind me we have got  you know ready to change  and ready to lead  well i think we're ready for changes when it comes to helping take care of our seniors but to recognize  as all of the hands just did  that we are not talking only about issues that effect seniors these are family issues  these are issues that effect all generations together  there're really american issues and we've had in the past leader who have called on us as a nation to make smart choices about what needs to be done  yesterday i was in dubuque talking about some of the issues that i think are important on this campaign and i mention that it was   years ago yesterday  that president roosevelt singed the social security act  and when he signed the social security act he made it very clear that it was just a corner stone in a structure that was being built  but was by no means complete  and certainly president johnson   years later knew that we had to do something in order to help  seniors who didn't have the resources  as they aged to be able to deal with the health problems that do come  the older you get  you know that old story  the good news is  that you wake up in the morning  and the good news is you know that because you hurt everywhere  and so i think everybody knows as we get a little older  and things start to break down a little and you need some more help  and so president johnson recognized that and when he signed the medicare bill  he said no longer will this nation refuse to hand the justice to those who have given a lifetime of service  and wisdom  and labor  to the progress of this progressive country  well i consider myself a modern progressive  i am proud of all of the progress  we've made as a nation  but it didn't happen by accident  i didn't happen by wishing for it  it happened because people came together  and worked to achieve them  and sometimes over great odds  to reach what we saw as goals for our county  well today we face a new set of challenges  in part because of the very success of programs like social security and medicare  the good news is  we are living longer  and we are living healthier lives  but we still have to figure out  how we are going to get our system to catch up  with what is the reality of life today  long term costs already consume   percent of what we spent on medicaid  and is estimated by   that's going to grow by more than   percent  the average cost of a private room in a nursing home today is more than   dollars a year  the average hourly rate for home health aids has gone up   percent over this past year  medicare also faces significant financial challenges they are driven by the spiraling cost of health care  and unfortunately we are not addressing any of these issues and planning for the future  our current president hasn't called on us to make a national commitment to saving social security and medicare and in fact he's tried to privatize social security and instead of focusing on medicare he has given tax cuts to billionaires and contracts to companies like halliburton and his answer to the prescription drug needs of our seniors is a plan that takes a phd in bureaucracy to figure out and as you'll hear in a minute  it is not working for a lot of people  medicare part d  now this is all consistent with how this president sees our country  he wants to leave everything up to the individual  he believes in the  you're on your own  society  and if you look at you're on your own and you take the first letters  that's the yo yo society   applause  describes the up and down  well i think its time that we talked about and confronted a lot of these issues because for too many people  its like they're invisible to the president  we don't see what's happening in the lives of people here in iowa  and across the country from this white house  and i think that's outrageous because so many people have worked hard their entire lives and they realize they cant afford to retire  i was in las vegas two days ago  and i was in a super market  and i was shaking hands with everybody working in the super market  and i met a man  and he looked to be elderly  he looked to be probably in his  's  but ha had a staff badge on  so i greeted him  and i said   are you working here  he said  i have to  i don't have enough money for my wife and me to live on  so what do they have you do  he said   well you know i kind of help around and greet people and try to guide people to where they need to go but i don't know what i would do if they didn't give me a job  in his  's if you're a senior who has diligently paid your long term care insurance premiums for years  only to have the insurance companies turn around and deny you benefits because of some technicality buried in the fine print of your policy  well you're invisible to  and if you are a mother or father trying to raise your children and care for your aging relatives you're at your wits end trying to juggle it all  and you are invisible as well  and if you are that grandmother or grandfather struggling to make ends meet and heartsick at the thought of burdening your children and your grandchildren  it turns out you are invisible as well  well i want you to know that you are not invisible to me  and you certainly are not going to be invisible to the next president of the united states  because when we take back the white house  we are going to start seeing our fellow americans again   applause  i have a very different vision of our country  it's more in line with franklin roosevelt  harry truman and lyndon johnson  than george w  bush  because i reject the idea of a  on your own  society  the yo yo society  i think it is far better if it's a we're  all in this together society  where we're helping each other  you know  i wrote a book called it takes a village to raise a child  well it also takes a village to care for your aging relatives  you need these people to be there for you  to back you up  to provide some respite care and we're going to try and create support for people to do the most important work any of us will ever do and that's taking care of each other  whether it's our children  or our parents  or our spouses  i don't think long term care is a burden  i think it is a fundamental obligation  and i think if we work hard together  we can get policy that will help us all do what we should do as members of families  first  when i am president  i am going to take immediate steps  to address the growing problem of fraud and abuse committed against our seniors  and i am going to start with the long term care market  you know in recent years  millions of americans have done what they thought was the right thing  they have done out and they have purchased long term care insurance policies  they see the adds on tv  they get the phone calls at home  you know  they are talking for their neighbors  maybe a church somewhere people are saying  we got to prepare for the future  so guess what  millions of american have done that  including   right here in iowa  and they though they were being responsible  that if they ever needed long term care  it was paid for  only to find out when they actually needed the coverage the company denied it for no good reason  or they increase the premiums  or they withheld payments for months and even though people have been paying the premiums for years  they were stuck with the bill  now the bill can run into  's of thousands of dollars pretty quick  and many of you probably read the heartbreaking series in the des moines register over the last week or two and it describes what the means for families here in iowa  well  i became concerned about this  and back in march i wrote a letter to the government accountability office demanding an investigation into these practices  what was going on  because i was starting to hear these long term care policies are kind of new so it's only now that people are really starting to try and collect on them and get the help that they need from them  so in my office in new york  and people around the country are starting to hear these stories and i want to know what is really gong on  now as president  i will require all insurance companies that benefit from federal tax advantages or that want to market their products  through the federal employees' health benefit plan  which is all of them  they're going to have to meet new consumer protection standards  that will be the fastest way to begin to regulate this market  because the federal employees' health benefit program covers   million federal employees to compete for the business  so if they want to compete for the federal employees business  as well as mary rose's or pat's business  they are going to have to meet standards that will protect against fraud and abuse  they're going to have to disclose their average rate increases over the past   years so that seniors know which companies inflate their prices  we are going to put all of that in an easily accessible format  so that people can get the information they need before they make a choice  we're going to require that they put all of their fine print into easy to understand english  people are going to be able to read it  know exactly what it says  and what they are purchasing  no more hiding behind  loopholes and traps that they spring on seniors when the seniors need the help  we are going to require that insurers offer inflation protection  because many seniors don't realize that a nursing home facility that costs   dollars a day in   could cost   dollars a day in   years  so we have to protect against the cost going up and let seniors know what they are buying when they actually give that check over  in addition  i will require that companies be more careful in setting their rates in the first place  so they will be less likely to hit seniors with ballooning premiums later  if a company decides it wants to increase premiums  they are going to have to put a larger share of their increases into paying claims instead of building up their profits  and i will require insurers to sit down with potential buyers and assess whether long term care coverage is really right for them  because medicaid already covers long term care for low income americans  i don't think it's right that some companies are tricking customers into buying double coverage which they do not need  and the way i see it  i don't think anybody should have to worry about some clause buried in   pages of fine print  or having some insurance company make them feel that they're going to be secure  and when affect what they are doing is just pulling the wool over their eyes  and we are going to put an end to that  we are going to change the regulations we are going to force them and then when seniors do have to move into assisted living or long term care facilities we want to do everything we can to protect them from abuse and neglect  you know  there are thousands of professionals and paraprofessionals who are providing excellent care for our seniors every single day  but sadly  senior abuse cases are on the rise  they jumped   percent in the last   years  i co sponsored legislation called the patient safety and abuse prevention act  we need a nation wide system of criminal background checks not only for long term care workers  but home health care workers as well  when someone comes into your home  you need to have confidence that that person will not hurt you  or rob you  or in some other way take advantage of you  but you know elderly fraud and abuse  isn't limited to long term care  or home health care  for many of our seniors  it's on the other end of their telephone line  today    percent of the victims of telemarketing fraud are over   fraudsters pray on seniors  offer prizes and sweepstakes  and lotteries that lure people  into a web of deception  i have seen things in what's happening in the mortgage market  a lot of seniors were talked into taking out home equity loans allegedly at low interest  and the interest was raised on them  and there are seniors across our country that are in danger of losing the home that they have purchased had paid off  until they bought into a home equity scam  so it's not only on long term care  we have got to send out the alarm  seniors should be extremely careful in buying anything somebody tries to sell you  over the telephone  and once someone has responded to any of these scams  their personal information is often added to a so called  suckers list  which is sold to other fraudsters  making them prime targets for identity theft as well  that's why i'm proposing we give seniors and other victims  the right to sue companies that misuse their personal data to perpetuate fraud  i also think  we need to have a center for telecommunications record privacy  because we've got to stay ahead of the fraudsters  they are a step ahead of us  you know  it started with people calling from i think nigeria or somewhere years ago  saying that if you just sent me money  somebody will be saved from a terrible persecution and its gotten much more sophisticated than that  so we need people to be up to date about what is going on and we need one person in the government in charge of developing a coordinated strategy to protect personal phone records  and years ago  about   years ago i think  i proposed legislation that you could not export people's private information unless they agreed to it  because you know what happens with all these call stations  and other things that are going on in foreign countries  they have no laws protecting privacies so we've got to get smarter about how we are going to protect privacy and particularly protect our seniors second  when i am president we are going to offer a renewed commitment to social security  we have fought the president on his ill advised scheme to privatize social security  that was a terrible idea  and thankfully we beat him back and we are not going to have to face that  but the problem is that the president has two big priorities  tax cuts for the wealthiest americans and the iraq war  and he hasn't paid for either one of them  he has put them on the giant credit card   applause  and where has he gotten the money for tax cuts for the wealthy and the iraq war  two sources  borrowing from the social security trust fund  and borrowing from foreign countries like china  we have got to get back to fiscal responsibility and shore up the social security trust fund  when my husband left office in   because we had a balanced budget with a surplus  the social security trust fund was totally solvent and safe until   six and a half years later with george bush's reckless fiscal policies  its lost   years  its down to   so we have to get back to fiscal responsibility and use those surpluses to shore up the social security trust fund  and i will do that  third we have got to get seniors a real prescription drug benefit that is truly there whenever they need it  right now  american seniors pay   to   percent more for the very same drugs that seniors in europe and canada pay  and some pay hundreds  some even pay thousands of dollars a month for their medication  i did not vote for the medicare part d plan  because i thought it was a plan for drug companies and not a plan for our seniors   applause  and we are going to work  to reform and change that plan  we're going to let our seniors through medicare negotiate for lower prices with these drug companies  something that the bush administration has forbidden  now this makes no sense at all  why wouldn't you want to negotiate for a lower price if you were really on the side of seniors  you're on the side of drug companies  you don't want to negotiate for a lower price  well we're going to do that  we are also going to keep our fight up to allow the re importation of american drugs back from canada so people can by them safely   applause  as a lot of people have done over the years over the years  and i know  i bet there are people  we are going to hear from them in a minute  from mary rose  i bet there are more people here who have fallen into the so called doughnut hole under part d of the prescription drug benefit  you know  you spend more than   dollars and get no help until you spend more than   dollars  that just doesn't make any sense at all  and we are going to hear a very specific example of that  fourth  here's an issue i care deeply about that nobody ever talks much about and that is we have to support the growing number of grandparents who are raising children  you know it's not an issue you hear much about  is it  but believe it or not four and a half million american children are living in grandparent headed households  nearly   of them here in iowa  many of these grandparents  and it is mostly grandmothers  find themselves in a very unexpected position  they are living on fixed incomes  they are not as strong and healthy as they used to be and all of a sudden they have to figure our school enrollment forms and health care and keeping up with small children again  i have been working on smoothing i call the kinship caregiver support act  its bipartisan  i introduced it several years ago to give more help to grandparents who are raising children later in life  programs like the muscatine community y here in iowa provides support groups here in iowa provide support groups and counseling and educational seminars and recreational activates  i helped to start a housing complex in new york city for grandparents raising children so they can be safe together  they didn't want to life in apartments where there were people they did not want to trust with their grandchildren so it's all grandparents raising children and they support each other  we have to start thinking about how we are going to do more of that  and finally as president i will continue the work i started in the senate to help seniors keep their independence and live in their won homes and communities  the work starts with our caregivers  the ones who are juggling the needs of sometimes growing children and aging parents  and maybe having to work full time as well  and if everybody who is giving care stopped today it would cost   billion dollars to replace  cut off  this is not only the right thing to do  this is an economic service being done to care for people who cannot totally care for themselves  but just because family care giving is unpaid does not mean it doesn't cost  and obviously it's very rewarding and important but it can be exhausting and expensive  and i was proud to finally pass legislation i introduced called the lifespan respite act  to give temporary relief to those caring for their loved ones   cut off  i also think we should consider tax credits for individuals and caregivers  tax deductions for long term care insurance  and now there is a new phenomenon where people are banding together themselves to help buy services that they will need in order from them to stay in their own homes  so i am very hopeful that we can really focus  cut off  on the issues that seniors talk to me about  you know my   year old mother who has always been very independent  after my father died in   she did not want to give up her home  she didn't want to move in with any of her children  so she held on as long as she could  but it got to be difficult driving and that's what really convinced her that she could no longer live on her own because she couldn't see well at night to drive and see needed  cut off "], ["clinton", "thank you  oh my goodness  i'm very appreciative on a personal level for that wonderful introduction and it is a great pleasure for me to serve alongside such a great leader as congressman clyburn  i don't think there's any doubt in anybody's mind that he is a big dog  and he's a big dog who's leading the pack for our country and i'm very grateful that he would be here because obviously i am well aware there is a historic football game being played tonight  you know  when i heard that the dinner was going to compete with the game between the university of south carolina and south carolina state university  i thought for a moment that it might just be president scott and me here  but i appreciate that so many of you are committed to the work of the naacp here in charleston  throughout the state  and indeed across the country and i am deeply honored that i could be with you  i want to thank our two mcs  who have done a wonderful job this evening  thanks to both octavia and rafael  i also want to thank our two musical performers who i thought were unbelievably special  daniel davis and crystal brown gibson  it's wonderful being here with so many elected officials and i'm grateful they are here to be with your mayor  whom i've known a very long time and am very proud of the work that has been done under his leadership in charleston  and of course  it gives me a lot of pleasure to thank dot scott and to call her madame president  i love the ring of that  and i was very moved by the tribute to your fallen firefighters  obviously  as a senator from new york  i have some understanding of the pain and the loss  the grief and shock that losing those nine brave firefighters has caused in this community and particularly to their families  it reminds us every day of the preciousness of life and the both opportunity and obligation each of us has to do our part to advancing the cause of freedom  to caring for one another  for walking our individual journeys with a sense of a destination that is better for everyone  and that's what the naacp has done for so many years and now with this  st annual freedom fund banquet  it continues the tradition  dot and i went over and met some of the young people  the next generation of leaders for the naacp  for this city  this state  and this country  i want to thank everyone who understands the mission of the naacp  it is a big dog  but it's a dog with a conscience   that's an unusual combination   calling us to understand that  as americans  we have to keep faith with all that came before  the naacp's leadership was evident these past few weeks  as you called the nation's attention to an example of present day discrimination happening in jena  louisiana  and the naacp and people of goodwill everywhere stood up and made sure their voices were heard  asking tough questions about the administration of justice  and yesterday an appeals court heard those voices and it took another look and said justice was not done  let me be clear  there is no excuse for the way the legal system treated those young people  this case reminds us that the scales of justice are seriously out of balance when it comes to charging  sentencing and punishing african americans  and we cannot forget this is not over yet  there are still questions unanswered  the case in jena cries out for a full investigation by the department of justice's civil rights division  and it reaffirms my conviction that the next president must have a justice department devoted to justice and a civil rights division that works for all americans  this case reminds us that we have so much work yet to do  america's long march to freedom  equality and opportunity has been marked by many milestones like the creation of the naacp  or the montgomery bus boycott  the sit ins at the orangeburg lunch counter organized by a young jim clyburn  that fateful sunday march across the pettis bridge in selma  alabama  but these milestones do not mark the end of the journey our country has been on  they are way stations along that journey  the march is not over  and today  america needs the naacp and its leadership as much as we ever have before  i've been traveling across our country  i came today to be with you from california  i crisscrossed the country  from one coast to the other  from north to south  and i see the strength and the dynamism of our great nation  but i also hear the voices of so many americans who are worried about our future  they're not sure of the direction we are headed and they ask with concern and even insecurity  what's next  they're aware that we have an income gap that has grown like a chasm in our country  between the very very best off in america and all the rest of us  and it's a gap that is even greater between african americans and white americans  we have a health care gap  the access to health care is not even in our nation  we all know that  the rates for disease and the failure to treat those diseases is a disparity that we should not tolerate  we have an achievement gap between the rates of graduation and access to higher education  between the gleaming corridors of suburban schools and the deplorable conditions along the corridor of shame  and we have an investment gap when inner cities and rural america are left behind because we are failing to invest in either the physical infrastructure or the human potential  and indeed we even have a democracy gap right now in america  when some americans  particularly people of color  have to wait at the polls for hours while others down the road or in the next town cast their votes within minutes  there's something wrong  and as we have seen  most recently  we have a justice gap  reverend darby referred to the disparity in sentencing when it comes to cocaine  well  that is just one of the disparities  of drug users in america are african american  but african americans make up   of all drug offenders sent to prison  so how do we close all of these gaps  how do we move forward toward a more perfect union  continue that progress that has been the hallmark but we cannot let it stop now  i start with my conviction that our families and communities  our churches and civic organizations  our states  and our country have to work together to help each child live up to his or her god given potential  that  to me  is the rallying cry for america  but instead of tapping that potential and working to bring america together  too many americans today feel as though they are invisible   that their problems  their daily struggles  are not covered in the media  not the concern of people in public life or in the boardrooms of america  and indeed that they are being forgotten instead of enlisted in this great american commitment to a better future  well  indeed that's what's happened in the last years  you know  we've had an attorney general who doesn't respect the rule of law or enforce the civil rights laws on the books  we've seen supreme court justices turn the clock back on brown vs  board of education  tax breaks have been given for drug companies ahead of health care for poor children  no bid contracts given to halliburton  while more than   people still live in trailers along the gulf coast  in short  we have seen the creation of a government that turns american values on their heads   a government of the few  by the few  and for the few  it breaks tradition because  for us  we want to believe that our government represents all of us  don't we  it's taken many years of struggle to get to that point  most of us in this room tonight were not in our constitution  it took a long time before we amended it to include  at least on paper  constitutional rights for us all  and to feel as though the clock is being turned back is unacceptable in our country  this new vision of government that has been propagated in washington  that jim clyburn and i have been fighting against  is called the ownership society  well  the reality is they own it and want you to work for it  you're on your own is a better description  if you take the first letters of you're on your own  it spells yo yo  and that's the way a lot of people feel  somebody else holding the string and moving it up and down  because if you are a child in a crumbling school along the corridor of shame  you are invisible  and if you're a young man caught in the brutal revolving door of low skills  no jobs  and a justice system stacked against you  you're invisible as well  if you're a mother without health care  a father without a job  a family that can't get by on the minimum wage  well  you're invisible  too  if you're a voter  turned away from the polls for no good reason or voting on a broken machine that doesn't even record your vote  you're invisible  and if you're stuck on a rooftop or stranded at the super dome during a hurricane  you're invisible to this president  even when you're on cnn  well  these people are not invisible to the naacp  and they're not invisible to me  and they should never be invisible to the president of the united states  these stories and these concerns should be there on a daily basis in the oval office because when we're invisible to each other  we're not working together  we're not rolling up our sleeves and trying to solve problems  we're not seeing each other or listening  and we are the poorer for it  we've got to get america back into the solutions business  when i was growing up  i believed that my country could do anything we set our minds to  and during my lifetime  i saw many examples of that  i saw a supreme court come down with the decision called brown vs  board of education  i saw a president who sent in troops to make sure children could go to school in little rock  arkansas  i heard a president say we'll send a man to the moon and bring him back safely before the end of the decade  i watched as a president signed civil rights laws and voting rights laws and medicare and medicaid to care for the poor and care for the elderly  republican and democratic presidents alike kept moving us forward  we have been in the grip of a dangerous experiment in extremism the last six and a half years  it has been  it has been a repudiation of the bi partisanship that together has moved our country  jim quoted abraham lincoln  a great republican president  and you could pick many others from both sides of the aisle  our current president campaigned as a compassionate conservative and it turned out he was neither  and we have been paying a price  and this is not about partisanship  this is about being an american again  this is about caring that our country has these challenges and then working to overcome them  now  all of you in charleston know how important the ongoing struggle is  and i know later we'll have a chance to join hands and sing  we shall overcome  well that story of that song speaks volumes about the power of working with one another and looking out for each other  sixty years ago the workers of the american tobacco company here in charleston were on strike  these women sang a song on the picket line that many people had known as  i'll be alright  or  i'll overcome someday  but the women of charleston sang it with a very important difference   we  they sang  we will overcome someday  and your own septima clark would later help change the word  will  to  shall  and this version echoed across continents and generations  out of the mouths of protesters and the mouths of presidents   i will overcome  was a fine song but  we shall overcome  moved mountains and changed the world and we need a president who will make that same change in our government   the change from  i  to  we  we are all in this together  and it's time we make government work for all of us again  it's time that we make government a true partner not just with those who are already privileged but with every small town  every small hamlet  every group of people in our country  i believe that one of the most important jobs of the next president is to define a new vision of prosperity and fairness for the  st century   a vision for how we restore prosperity for working and middle class americans who are the heart and soul of this nation and how we can achieve the promise of our founding  that we are all created equal  endowed by our creator with inalienable rights  and here's what i believe  the foundation of a strong economy is the investments we make in each other   in education  in health care  in jobs and housing  sarah ford talked about the problems we're having across america and the very great difficulty people are facing because of the mortgage crisis  we have so many middle class people who are hanging on and so many who used to be in the middle class falling back into poverty  during the  s we saw the creation of twenty two million new jobs and more people lifted out of poverty than at any time in our country's history  last month we lost four thousand jobs in america and people are justifiably concerned about what will happen to their home  their health care  their job  their future  greatness has come in america from our recognition that it is not rich people who made america great   it is the hardworking middle class and working people who made america great and continues to make us great  we've got to get back to creating good jobs with rising wages and i'm convinced we can do that  we have to move back to fiscal responsibility  six and a half years ago we had a balanced budget and a surplus  that has been squandered  the president has had two major goals of his presidency  tax breaks for the wealthiest and the war in iraq  but he has not paid for either  he's put them on the credit card  the way he's funded them is to borrow money from the social security trust fund and borrow money from countries like china every single day  so we are in  hoc  as a nation  we're borrowing money even from mexico  we need to get back to a sense of responsibility in the federal government and then we've got to look at how we're going to create new jobs by a new energy plan that puts people to work in america by going ahead and combating global warming right here at home   something important for coastal states like south carolina  we need to rebuild our infrastructure and i think that if we had a jobs program based no energy  the environment  and infrastructure  we would put millions of americans back to work again  we need to provide a high quality education for every single child  and i want to have a universal pre kindergarten program that is especially focused on children from disadvantaged backgrounds  i heard the mayor talking about that  we know that if children get a good quality pre school education  they stay in school  they do better  and the evidence is overwhelming that with a good quality pre school program in our country we would cut by   the achievement gap between black and white youngsters by the time they graduated from high school  we've got to make college affordable again and i want to brag on the democratic congress particularly with our leader here  leader clyburn  the democratic congress has just passed legislation to lower interest rates and increase the amount of pell grants so we can get back to making college affordable again  and let's not forget all of the decent young people who don't go to college  let's get more apprenticeship programs  more technical programs  they deserve our help to have a job that makes them competitive in the global economy  i believe we can guarantee every single american quality  affordable health care  it is time  we have   million americans without health insurance  but it's not just about insuring the uninsured although i believe that is a moral imperative  in some groups that i speak to some people come up to me afterwards and they say  i don't know anyone that's uninsured  i say  well  go to an emergency room some night and sit in that emergency room and watch people come in because they have no where else to go  so it is a moral imperative that we come up with a health care plan to cover everyone  but it's not only that  we have to make sure that the people with insurance actually get taken care of because too many people with insurance when their doctor says they need a certain treatment  the insurance company says no  i have this problem all the time as a senator  a man from northern new york called me and said 'senator  what have i done wrong  i've worked for the same employer for years  i've always paid my premiums  my family has always been healthy  now my son has been diagnosed with a rare disease and the doctors say there's one place in the country where he should be treated and the insurance companies say they won't send him there  or a mother from long island  ny calls and says her daughter has leukemia and she needs a stem cell transplant but they have to have a donor and it's expensive to search for a donor and the insurance company won't pay for the search  so i get on the phone and my staff gets on the phone and we argue with the insurance companies and they're afraid that we'll embarrass them and so finally they say  fine  the boy can have his operation and we'll pay for the donor search  it should not take a united states senator to get the health care that a mother and a father need for their sons and daughters  on monday i'll be releasing the third part of my health care plan  the first part is lowered costs for everybody  premium costs have gone up   in the last six years  more and more employers can't afford to cover people  insurance is getting more bare bones  so let's get costs down and let's improve quality and that includes emphasizing prevention  as dot and i were walking in  there's a poster outside that says   of south carolinians have heart disease  we stopped and starred at it  i was shocked at that high figure  mayor  we've got to do more to help people keep themselves healthy  we don't pay for prevention in america  if you are diabetic  a lot of insurance companies won't pay for you to have your feet checked or your eyes checked but if you have to have your foot amputated  they'll pay for the operation  that's just upside down and backwards  so we've got to get to a point where we are paying for prevention and then we have to cover everybody  i think the time has come because doctors  nurses  hospitals  employers  labor  everybody realizes we are losing jobs in the global economy because we don't have the health care system that can effectively deliver health care with high value at lower cost  but then we also have to restore competence to our government  now i never thought that would be an applause line that you stand up and say  we got to get our government to be competent ' but after katrina  we have to end the no bid contracts  we have to get rid of the cronyism in government and we have to get back to an old fashioned idea of appointing qualified people to the positions they hold in the united states government  in particular  we've got to have a justice department that functions again  today i released my agenda to restore and strengthen the civil rights mission of the department of justice  it is a five point plan that will meet the challenges of this time  the first is to begin undoing the damage of the past years  i want an attorney general who will conduct a thorough review and report back with recommendations on how to restore the department's traditional role in enforcing civil rights and respecting the rule of law  the attorney general should also review charges of improper  politically motivated hiring and firing to determine whether laws have been broken  remember it was republican u s attorneys who really sounded the alarm about all the partisan activity going on in the justice department  we cannot have that  ladies and gentleman  we have to believe that justice is blind in america  and we have to fully fund the civil rights division  we've got to get back to allowing local communities to look for ways to pursue integration and reduce racial inequality  the court's action in its recent case was a big setback to voluntary efforts that local communities had adopted themselves  nobody ordered them to  they decided what they wanted to do  and we've got to give some money and expertise to local communities to help them figure out how best to fulfill the meaning of the equal protection clause  i want to lead a great effort to fight discrimination in the workplace  a recent study found a shocking fact  employers were twice as likely to hire a white applicant with the very same qualifications as a black applicant  and even hired at a greater percentage  white applicants with criminal records over black applicants without one  anyone who says that we have gotten beyond racial discrimination is not living with their eyes open  i believe we have to shine a bright light on any discrimination  whether it be against people of color or against women and make sure that we truly fulfill our laws  not just by the letter but by the spirit  i also want to clean up our elections and i have introduced legislation to do that and we're attempting to get a bill through the congress  we have to prosecute and punish deceptive practices  you've heard about them  people come out of church and there's a flier on the window  under the windshield wiper and it says you're supposed to vote on wednesday not tuesday  or people pick up the phone and a voice says  we're just calling to inform you that if you're ever even had a traffic ticket you cannot vote  all kinds of deceptive practices  and then we've got the new challenge of the identification requirements  which are in many respects  discriminating against the poor  the elderly  i see that in new york  in new york city we have a lot of people that don't have a driver's license because they take the subway and now in order to be able to vote they have to produce something like a driver's license  so we've got to make sure that we are not disenfranchising americans after having spent fifty years trying to extend the franchise to every single american  i would also like to see us modernize and strengthen our laws against hate crimes and generally reassert our belief that we are stronger when we respect and protect the rights of every single one of us  and of course we must begin to end the war in iraq and bring our troops home as quickly and responsibly as we can  the reality is this is a sectarian civil war  there is no military solution  our young men and women who wear the uniform of our country have performed heroically and with great honor and dedication and they have done what they were asked to do  they were given a mission and they have fulfilled it  they were asked to get rid of saddam hussein and bring him to justice and they did  they were asked to give the iraqis a chance for free and fair elections and they did as well and they were asked to give the iraqi government the space and time to make the political decisions that only the iraqis can make for themselves  so their mission has been completed  unfortunately neither the iraqi government  nor our government  have done what they needed to do politically and diplomatically to deal with the challenges in iraq  the people voted for change in november   we have been fighting for change in the congress  and i hope that the president will work with us to start bringing our troops home  engage in a very concerted effort to get the iraqis to make the tough decisions they have to make and start a diplomatic process in the region and the world to try to bring more countries into the effort to stabilize iraq going forward  but if the president does not end the war in iraq  then the next president must  that has to be part of what happens as soon as possible  so i believe that america is ready for change and it's change that is part of the american character and experience  you know  we believe in change  we are the people of the future  when you travel around the world as i've been privileged to do  it's striking how own in places near and far  they are looking backwards not forwards  when i was first lady and i would represent our country and i would go to meetings with presidents and prime ministers and other dignitaries  often just as an ice breaker  i would say  so how are things going here in whatever country i was in  i cannot tell you how many times people started their answers by talking about something that happened   or   years ago   well things are fine except  you know  if it hadn't been for that war   years ago  things would be a lot better  we are the people of the future and we need to start acting like that again  there is no problem we face in the world that we cannot meet  if we decide as americans we will do that  you cannot be a leader if no one is following and right now our country has to rebuild our standing and position in the world because there is no problem we face whether it be global terrorism or global warming or global epidemics that we can take on by ourselves  so it's important that we give back so that feeling of confidence and optimism that has marked our country over these long centuries of progress and hope  when jim was talking about my own life  i did start out as a young lawyer working for a native south carolinian  marion wright edelman at the children's defense fund and i remember being so struck by how dedicated she and everyone working with her were to making it possible to change lives one at a time  i went door to door finding children who weren't in school because in those days  so many children were kept out of school if they had minor disabilities  if the had to take care of their siblings  and that was only   years ago  we had millions of children who weren't even going to school  and then we passed the individuals with disabilities in education act and we began to reach out to every single child  that's what i believe we do at our best  we reach out to one another  and i'm going to do everything i can  working with you to make the change happen that america is yearning for  i know it's not easy  there are lots of reasons why people would stop trying to get health care for everyone or trying to get a new energy policy that took the tax breaks away from the oil companies  if it were easy  anyone would do it  we do it because we are americans  we can't let ourselves be stopped by the partisan bickering or the divisiveness or the enormity of the challenges we face  there are those who will say it can't be done  there always are  but as james baldwin once noted   those who say it can't be done are usually interrupted by others doing it  for nearly   years  the naacp has been interrupting the nay sayers  changing laws and changing lives  that's why i'm honored to be with you tonight and i'm honored to walk alongside you in the march for justice  i look forward to continuing that march in the months and years ahead  because it leads to the destination that is america's destiny   that more perfect union  that place where not only we look at one another and recognize those inalienable rights  but we work to make sure that every single child has a chance to live up to his or her god given potential  and that americas goodness and greatness is recognized across the world  thank you all and god bless you "], ["clinton", "i am honored to be here with you today at broadlawns medical center  for many years  as you've heard  this center has been providing care for the people of this community including many of those most in need and i cannot think of a better place to discuss america's health care crisis than a medical center that confronts the consequences every single day i want to thank jody jenner  broadlawns' president and ceo  along with the board and the staff of this fine medical center  i want to thank lisa bechtel  a proud seiu nurse along with her colleagues who take care of the people who come through the doors here seeking help and support  and i want to thank susan kirstein  the chief nursing executive  i'm a strong  strong supporter of nurses and i appreciate the role that they play and i'm looking forward to expanding that role because i think it will be important to do so in the future of health care as i see it  and to the entire staff of broadlawns  thank you for being on the frontline  the statistics that you've heard are just really a snapshot  so many of the patients here come because they have needs that are not being met elsewhere and i hear their stories across our country and i've certainly heard them here in iowa  i want to start by telling you about judy rose  who i met last month in dubuque along with her husband john  back in   john lost his job of thirty years when the plant where he worked closed with just one day's notice  and so  judy and john lost not only john's job  they lost their health insurance  a couple of months later  judy was diagnosed with breast cancer  thankfully a special government program started during my husband's administration took care of her treatment and she recovered  but then in   john had a heart attack  he spent hours in surgery and was in the intensive care unit  fortunately he survived  but when the bills came  their luck ran out  the costs of john's care were so high they had to sell the home they lived in for thirty years  that is the tragedy at the heart of our health care system   the devastation when one stroke of bad luck undoes a lifetime of hard work  that feeling of being right on the edge that eats away not just at the   million who don't have health care  but many of the   million who do  it's the heartbreak you feel when your spouse asks   can we afford my pills this month  and you don't know the answer  when your sick child asks   can i see a doctor  and you can't bear to answer  when you ask your doctor   will my insurance pay for that  and from the look on her face  you already know the answer  it's what has led to so many people in so many places over so many years to ask me   what are you going to do about health care for america  and then more quietly   and what am i going to do about health care for me and my family  well i'm here today because i believe it is long past time that this nation had an answer  that's why i'm running for president  because i believe america is ready for change  because like you  i remember how we entered the  st century  filled with hope  ready to seize the promise of a more prosperous nation and a more peaceful world  but like you  i've seen how in the last six and a half years  we've done just the opposite  we've gotten mired in another country's civil war  a war without a military solution  we have failed to invest in our future  in our schools  technology  science and infrastructure  and we're falling behind  costs are rising and wages are lagging  premiums have almost doubled   up   no  up   since   and half of all personal bankruptcies in america are caused by medical bills  if there was ever a need for change in america it is now  and if there was ever a moment to do what america does best  to confront the challenges we face  this is it  that's what we've always done  whether it was teddy roosevelt busting the trusts  or fdr seeking to end elderly poverty  whether it was president truman sending the gis to college and into the middle class  or president johnson ensuring health care for all americans in their golden years and who were poor  when the time for change came  we weren't afraid  we didn't look away  we came together and we made american stronger  more prosperous  and more fair  we are and have always been a nation of opportunity   a nation that believes in giving everyone a chance to make the most of their own lives  and of course we believe in responsibility  but when families are struggling  when they don't have the basic necessities that allows them to see these opportunities  we don't leave them to fend for themselves  unfortunately that's exactly what we've seen in the past six and a half years  instead of an era of opportunity  we've had a  you're on your own  era  so many people  families who can't afford health care  young people who can't afford college  seniors who can't afford to retire  it's like they are invisible to the president  like he's looked right through them  well  i don't think anyone in america should be invisible  i believe every child should have a world class education  every worker should have a job with good wages and good benefits  every american should have a secure retirement  and today  as we strive for a new beginning to the  st century  i believe everyone  every man  woman and child  should have quality  affordable health care in america  we should do it  we should do it because in this new economy  when people move jobs more than ever before  their health insurance should move with them  we should do it because doctors and nurses  not insurance company employees  should be calling the shots on patient care  we should do it because solving the health care crisis is key to ensuring american competitiveness in the global marketplace  we should do it because in a nation where we split the atom  sent a man to the moon  mapped the human genome  where we have some of the most promising treatments and cures available  hard working people should get the care they need when they're sick  and we should do it because it is the right thing to do  because we can no longer tolerate the injustice of a system that shuts out nearly one in six americans  ultimately this is about who we are as a people and what we stand for  we can talk all we want about freedom and opportunity  about life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness  but what does all that mean to a mother or father who can't take a sick child to the doctor  to someone who can't take the job of his dreams because it doesn't offer health care  to a family filing for bankruptcy or losing their home because their medical bills were just too high  we are the richest country in the world and we spend right now  more on health care than anyone else in the world  two trillion dollars a year  but we're ranked  st in life expectancy and  th in child mortality  each year    people die in america because they don't have health care  let me repeat that  here in america  people are dying because they couldn't get the care they needed when they were sick  at the same time  over the past six and a half years  the special interests have had a field day at the expense of the middle class and hard working families  just look at our prescription drug program  it doesn't allow medicare to use its purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices  so every year  billions of dollars go straight from the pockets of families to the profits of drug companies  this is unconscionable  it is intolerable and it is time to put an end to it  it is time for us to come together and to start living up to our own values  to provide quality  affordable health care for every single american  and i intend to be the president who accomplishes that goal finally for our country  now as you may know  i've been fighting on health care for nearly thirty years  starting as first lady of arkansas  where i headed a task force to improve rural health care  and most memorably of course back in the early  s  and i still have the scars to show from that exercise  but i've also learned some valuable lessons that have shaped how i approach health care reform today  first  i think we have all learned that america needs to provide health insurance for all americans  the last twelve years have shown how left on their own  this crisis and those who contribute to it  and people from all corners of our economy will see our situation deteriorate  a growing number of ceos and union leaders are coming together because they agree that now is the right time to renew the national call for quality  affordable health care  when andy stern  the president of seiu stands with lee scott  the president of wal mart  and they both demand health care reform that covers everyone  you know we're ready for change  second  i learned that people who are satisfied with their current coverage  want assurances that they can keep it  part of our health care system is the best in the world and we should build on it  part is broken  and we should fix it  the first rule of medicine is do no harm  and we will do no harm to the parts of our system that are working  instead  we will build on them  that means not just expanding coverage  but also cutting costs and improving quality  so that we will have health care for all  and better health care for all  because we need to address the concerns of those who have insurance  as well as those who do not  that's why i started my path to this place here  at broadlawns  with a series of health care speeches  i gave a speech on lowering health care costs which helps everyone in the system  and i gave a speech on improving quality  which also helps everyone  third  i learned how important it is to present a plan that is clear and easy to understand  today's plan is simpler  yet still bold  now i know my republican opponents will try to equate health care for all americans with government run health care  well don't let them fool us again  this is not government run  there will be no new bureaucracy  you can keep the doctors you know and trust  you keep the insurance you have if you like it  but this plan expands personal choice and increases competition to keep costs down  fourth  i learned about how to build the national consensus you need to get health care passed  my plan is the result of discussions with many people  doctors and nurses  hospitals administrators  and lawyers  unions and most importantly  america's families  who are frustrated with the system we have now  i have been asking a lot of questions and doing a lot of listening  having spent six years in the senate  i know that fixing health care will require political will to get the votes we need  and it will take a movement for change  a solid national consensus for reform that can withstand the impact of the special interests  and i will work to build that movement throughout my campaign and as your president  because in the end  change is just a word unless you have the strength and experience to make it happen  these are new times and this is a new plan  and when it comes to health care reform  i believe i have exactly the experience we need to get it done in my first term as president  while i was disappointed by what happened in   i did not give up  i continued to fight  i worked to expand coverage step by step  person by person  i began working to expand and improve health care for children  helping to create the state children's health insurance program  it's known as the hawk i program here in iowa  that program provides insurance for more than six million low income children  and i worked to create the vaccines for children program  today  childhood immunizations are at an all time high  i worked to ensure that new prescription drugs are tested not just for adults  but for children too  and i wrote legislation in the senate to get that accomplished  because children should have access to the best and safest treatment and cures available  i also worked as first lady to ensure that breast and cervical cancer treatment would be covered by medicaid  and i helped to establish the commission that recognized gulf war illness as the serious problem it is for our vets who served in the first gulf war  and we began to address it  in the senate i've worked to expand health care to our men and women in uniform  believe it or not  many of our national guard and reserve members  the men and women who have been called to fight in iraq and afghanistan did not have health insurance for themselves or their families when they were activating  i'm proud of the legislation i passed to address that glaring problem  i've been fighting more generally to improve health care for veterans because it is outrageous that so many service members are returning home and being told to take a number and wait in line for the health care they need  and i will pass what's called the heroes at home legislation that helps those affected by traumatic brain injury and supports their families  i'm fighting to improve care for our seniors  to lower prescription drug costs by empowering medicare to negotiate with drug companies and by allowing imports of our drugs from canada at lower prices  and finally  following the horrific attacks of   i fought the epa and the bush administration when they claimed that the air at ground zero was safe   safe for our first responders and emergency workers  safe for our construction and building trade workers  safe for our residents and our volunteers  it wasn't  so i fought for health care for all of the first responders  the workers  the volunteers and residents who have gotten sick and some have even died  and i will keep fighting to protect them until they have the care they need  i know that reforming health care takes a consensus for change  that's what i've been doing   building that consensus vote by vote  working to bring people together  to get my colleagues from across the aisle to join our cause  unfortunately back in   and   too many of our opponents adopted a strategy that allowed them to  just say no  they said no  not just to our health care plan  but any health care plan  and the current administration hasn't even tried  in fact  the president's most newsworthy contribution on health care was his recent threat to veto coverage for low income children  well  today americans are impatient  we've seen that doing nothing makes the problem worse  we've gone from   million uninsured in   to   million today  from spending   of our gross domestic product for health care to spending   and now we are spending   more per person than the next highest spending country in the world  switzerland  which has high quality and good outcomes for the people there  so today we are spending more money and covering fewer people and too many of our families are paying the price  we know we have to act  and so the question is  if union leaders and employers can come together  that the mayo clinic has just done an extensive survey including   experts coming to a report urging that we have health care reform  if democratic and republican governors and legislatures can work together on health care  if doctors  nurses  patients  hospital administrators  ceos  small business owners can all agree that it is time for a change  then why can't washington  i believe that together we can change washington by sticking to our principles and reaching out to find common ground  america faces a choice  continue the status quo as more and more people lose coverage or change our system to cover all of our people  i believe that is america's choice  to do something about health care   america's choice to tackle problems of cost  quality  and coverage  it should be every american's choice to have the kind of health care that they want  that choice is at the heart of my plan  i call my plan  the american health choices plan  this plan is the result of a thorough analysis of the nature and extent of the health care crisis  starting with the reality that roughly eight in ten of the uninsured  those who come through the doors of this medical center  come from working families  most are middle class  and families earning between   and   dollars a year are the fasted growing group of the uninsured  we all know that younger adults  ages   and older adults  ages   are the most susceptible to losing insurance coverage  indicating that it's hard to obtain coverage when you first start out in the world of work and harder to maintain it as you age and experience health problems  finally  employer sponsored health insurance is on the decline  in     of employers offered health benefits  down from   six years ago  this is at a time when people are changing jobs more frequently than ever before  many americans are now self employed  running businesses out of their homes and they struggle to buy health insurance  my plan takes all of these realities into account and addresses them head on  and this plan isn't just my plan  it's the product of hundreds of discussions with thousands of people in hospitals  and union halls  homes and businesses across america and going forward in this campaign and then as president  i'm going to keep reaching out  asking for ideas  not just in improving and enacting the plan  but in the daily work to make it a reality  now here's how this plan would work  if you have private insurance you like  nothing changes   you can keep that insurance  if you like the doctor you have  you can keep seeing that doctor  if you like the hospital where you receive care  you can keep receiving care at that hospital  if  however  you don't have health insurance or you don't like the insurance you have  you can choose from the same wide variety of private plans that members of congress choose from  i'm calling it a health choices menu  so essentially the congressional health care plan becomes the american health care plan  the idea here is simple  the american people should have access to the same array of health care choices and benefits as the senators and representatives they elect  you will also have as one of those choices a public plan  just like medicare is a public plan  you will have access to a public plan that will provide a stable  competitive alternative to private insurance if that is your choice  my plan does not create a single new government department  agency  or bureaucracy  it is not a government takeover of health care  it is a public private partnership that provides more choices  if you're an employer  you choose whichever plan is best for your business  if you're an individual  you choose whichever plan is best for you and your family and we will provide tax credit to ensure that you can pay for it  now whether you keep the insurance you have  or you choose one of the options in the health choices menu  you will have the following guaranteed  first  you will never be denied coverage because of preexisting conditions or risk factors  insurance companies will no longer be allowed to discriminate against high risk patients or charge exorbitant premiums to screen them out  so whether you were sick in the past or a genetic test shows you may get sick in the future  you will never again have to worry about finding affordable coverage  second  your coverage will be guaranteed  if you pay your premiums and follow the rules your insurance company will be required to renew your coverage each year at a price you can afford  even if you lose your job  even if you decide to start your own business or stay home with your children for a few years  third  your coverage will be affordable  my plan provides tax credits to make health care both universal and affordable for everyone  these new tax credits guarantee that you'll never pay more than a certain percentage of your income for your premium  no more worrying that one illness or one accident will lead to financial ruin  fourth  you will always have an option for coverage that is fully affordable  i will require insurance companies in the health choices menu to let you take your plan with you as you move from job to job or even state to state  now exactly  how will all of this be possible  well it's going to take shared responsibility  everyone with a stake in our health care system will have to step forward and do their part  while i will be requiring all americans to have health care  i will be calling on employers to do their part as well  today  large american companies compete in a global economy against companies in countries that impose far lower health care burdens on employers and many of our manufacturers are struggling to pay for retiree health commitments that our foreign competitors simply don't have  under my plan  large companies will be required to help pay for their employees' health care  those that do so can simply maintain their current policy that they choose  those that don't  will need to contribute towards the cost of covering their employees on a sliding scale based on their size and average wages  my plan also helps american manufacturers become more competitive by providing a tax credit for those struggling with the high cost of retiree health benefits  these costs are making it virtually impossible for american manufacturers to compete with their foreign counterparts  who don't have these kinds of costs  how can we possibly compete if a car company like general motors pays   in health care cost per car produced while toyota is only paying   per car  and think about the retirees who rely on these benefits today  people have accepted lower wages over the years in return for the promise of a secure retirement  the tax credit i provide will help employers cover catastrophic costs above a certain threshold   costs incurred by a few retirees with the most of your health problems  costs that can run hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single person  this relief will be a temporary measure designed to address the needs of the aging baby boomers and it will be available not just to qualifying private sector manufacturers but to states to help pay retiree costs for teachers  police officers  fire fighters  and others  in return for this assistance  companies will have to modernize their plans with initiatives to cut waste and improve quality   and they will have to show that they're using the tax credits to enhance their competitiveness and support their workers  we also know that health care costs are plaguing too many of our small businesses  that's a serious problem  because small businesses are now the engine of job creation in america  according to the federal reserve  since   companies with fewer than   employees were responsible for   of the additional new jobs in america   jobs that often cannot be outsourced  but at the same time  small businesses face higher premiums because of their limited purchasing power  and they tend to employ lower income workers  as a result  they cover far fewer of their employees  and that coverage is eroding  since   the percentage of small businesses offering benefits has fallen from   percent to   percent  now  under my plan  we won't require small businesses to cover employees  instead we will provide tax credits to ensure that many of them do  these tax credits will be based on size and average wages  so that small businesses can provide health care without destroying their bottom line  this credit could be as high as   of premiums for firms with fewer than   employees  it's a good start that small businesses are leading the way in creating new jobs  my goal is for them to create new jobs with good health care benefits as well  government also needs to do its part to promote shared responsibility  under my plan  the government will provide tax credits to insure that every single american can afford health insurance  the government will also invest in measures to improve health care quality and cut costs  this will result in dramatic savings which i will use to continue to make health care affordable  i outlined my cost saving measures in a speech back in may  i proposed a seven point plan to save   billion nationally each year by bringing our health care system into the twenty first century  by transitioning from outdated paper records to an electronic medical records system  by getting our chronic disease management costs under control  by allowing companies to compete for medicare's prescription drug business  and more  last month in new hampshire  i laid out my agenda to improve health care quality  a plan to raise standards  educate patients and help our doctors and nurses provide world class care  taken together these policies could save hundreds of dollars a year for the average american family  and make americans healthier  individuals will have to share the responsibility as well  much like drivers in most states are required to purchase car insurance  all americans will have a responsibility to get and keep health insurance in a system where insurance will now be affordable  the sad reality is that the uninsured don't just struggle with costs themselves  they impose costs on the rest of us  it's a hidden tax  the high cost of emergency room visits that could have been prevented by a much less expensive doctor's appointment  the cost of unpaid medical bills that lead insurance companies to raise rates on the rest of us  covering these individuals is the only way to get rid of these hidden taxes  the only way to guarantee affordable coverage for everyone is to cover everyone  and that is the choice we need for america  finally  i'll call on drug companies and insurance companies to do their part as well  it is time that we put patients  not drug companies and insurance companies  first  that means changing the way they do business  now clearly with drug companies we have to do more to get generic drugs to market  including the new biologics that are coming into the marketplace and are often extremely expensive  we do have to provide more negotiation to get drug prices down and to import from canada and other countries that are similar to ours  because ultimately  the american tax payer pays for the development of a lot of these drugs through nih grants and other kinds of research grants  we pay for the clinical trials  and then we pay the highest prices in the world  and we're going to begin to rein that in  it also means changing the way insurance companies do business in america  i will start by banning insurance company discrimination  right now  insurance companies have free reign to cherry pick the healthiest patients and shut out anyone who seems to them like a bad risk  insurance companies spend   billion a year on elaborate calculations and schemes to figure out how not to insure people    billion trying to shut out those who need care the most  and everyday they deny people coverage because of pre existing conditions or the result of genetic testing  think about what this might mean down the road with advances in genetic testing  the vast majority of us could wind up being bad risks because genetically most of us will probably show we are susceptible to something and therefore we will become uninsurable  so one of the urgencies behind this plan now is that the insurance industry as it has been constructed and executed over decades now will no longer be able to take care of increasing numbers of americans if they stick with the policy that eliminates our fellow citizens  this legalized discrimination against the sickest of americans is unfair and immoral and it defeats one of the central purposes of insurance  which is to share risk  my plan puts an end to this  it forces insurance companies to compete based on cost and quality  not how skillfully they can weed out the sickest patients  my plan also has a prevention initiative  requiring the insurance industry and public programs like medicare and medicaid to promote wellness as well as treat illness and provide every american with comprehensive preventive care  today we pay doctors and hospitals to treat diseases and injuries but not to prevent them from occurring in the first place  in fact  we've made it increasingly difficult for doctors to do that because of the way insurance companies reimburse physicians  diabetes care is a perfect example  many insurance companies won't pay for a diabetic to see a nutritionist to learn how to eat properly or a podiatrist to get their feet checked  but if you wind up having to have your foot amputated from complications due to diabetes  the insurance company will pay for that  and if you ask why  the insurance company will tell you  they don't want to pay for preventive health care because the patient might switch to a different company and they will lose the benefit of the investment in prevention  but if a patient needs his foot amputated  the reason he goes  the insurance company is pretty much stuck with that on their watch  now that is upside down and backwards and i'm going to change it because i think it's time we focused on keeping people healthy  not just on treating them when they become sick  now i know that these proposals will not make me the insurance industry woman of the year  but i don't think i've been in the running for that title since   at the same time  i truly believe there are plenty of people in the insurance industry who wish their companies did not make a profit by excluding the woman who discovers she's genetically predisposed towards getting breast cancer  or by burdening the family whose child has autism with unmanageable premiums  the idea is not to put the health insurance industry out of business  but to help it find a better way to make a living  under my plan  insurance company employees will have a whole new set of incentives  they will wake up everyday and focus on making profits by providing the highest quality care at the lowest cost and they'll never again be torn between turning a profit and improving the health care of individuals who make sure of communities and our country  now  how will i pay for this plan  first let me tell you how i will not pay for it  i won't pay for it by pouring money into a broken system  i won't pay for it by raising taxes on middle class families who are already struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages  instead  i'll pay for part of it by implementing the cost saving measures i outlined in may  and i will pay for some of it by rolling back part of president bush's fiscally irresponsible tax breaks for the highest income americans  and i'll pay for some of it by limiting the tax breaks for people making over   a year to the same level that ordinary  middle class americans get  right now  the highest income americans get some of the most generous health care benefits and the most generous tax deductions to go with them  well off americans should be able to deduct the cost of the same quality health plan that middle income families can deduct  if they want to receive extra benefits beyond what most middle income families get  they should pay for it themselves  not have tax payers foot the bill for them  announcing my plan today is just one step in a larger process  in the coming months  i will continue to reach out to people all across america and ask for their ideas and their reactions  because  to truly reform health care in america  we need more than a plan  we need a movement   a movement of people determined to change the system who will not rest until we succeed  lisa scott from greenville  iowa  whom i met back in may  is one of those people  six years ago  lisa's daughter  janelle  began having chest pains and black outs  she was sick for almost a year  janelle requested a chest x ray  but she never received it  because while she was working two jobs  she didn't have health insurance  and she couldn't afford to pay for it out of her own pocket  one week after being denied the chest x ray  at the age of   janelle died  her death certificate listed the cause of death as unknown  because janelle was never able to afford a proper diagnosis  a diagnosis that with care might have saved her life  it's too late to help her daughter  but lisa scott hasn't stopped speaking out and calling on us to come together and fix our health care system  she is determined to help other families  to spare them the loss and pain that her family felt  now that is who we are at our best  we are a nation where people help those they've never even met  where we do understand we are all in this together  that when a child is sick and can't see a doctor  the family loses everything because someone had an accident  when a mother or a father lies awake at night worrying about how they possibly care for the people they love  that diminishes all of us  now after   when people asked me if i was going to give up on health care reform  i always had the same answer  why would i give up on america and the american people  for so many years i have listened to their stories  i carry these stories with me everyday  and perhaps more than anyone else  i know just how hard this fight will be  but that is why i'm running for president  because i'm ready with you to help write a new story  the story about how we finally put aside our differences to face up to one of our greatest challenges  the story of how people of good faith and good will came together and worked out a solution because they cared too much about our country and their fellow citizens to let this crisis continue  the story of how everyone took responsibility  we all did our part  and we became a healthier  stronger  more prosperous nation because of it  we owe that to the rose family  we owe that to the memory of janelle and to her family  we owe that to every family in america  today  we have an opportunity to make history together  as president  i will seize that opportunity and i hope all of you will join me  thank you and god bless you "], ["clinton", "the carnegie institution for science  as president meserve just briefly recounted  has such a distinguished history  it has a record of supporting groundbreaking discoveries from edwin hubble's work in astronomy to more recent breakthroughs in our understanding of genetics and the function of rna and as part of that work was honored with a nobel prize just a few years ago i could not imagine a more appropriate place to discuss our nation's commitment to scientific discovery and innovation  nor could i imagine a more appropriate day  it is not a coincidence that we are doing this today  fifty years ago today  in a remote  sparsely inhabited region of the former soviet union the world's first artificial satellite took flight  this hollow aluminum sphere named sputnik   which contained little more than a battery  radio transmitters  and an internal cooling system   caught america off guard and changed the course of history  sputnik transmitted a signal from orbit and through it the soviet union sent a signal to the world  even ham radio operators could hear it  the soviets had won the first leg of the space race  now many of you have probably known before you came today that this is the anniversary of sputnik and i bet none of you bought an anniversary card  but i have been fascinated by sputnik ever since i was a little girl and as i have moved on in life and become involved in the public service and public office holding of our nation  i have spent time reflecting on what sputnik meant and what our nation did in response  historic decisions were made in the days  months  and years following sputnik and i think we had a great response as a nation  less than two weeks after news of sputnik swept the globe  president eisenhower called a meeting of his science advisory committee and asked for recommendations  he would come to rely on that panel for unvarnished  evidence based scientific advice  shortly after that first meeting  president eisenhower addressed the nation  it was a sober yet optimistic assessment  yes  the soviets had made gains which carried implications for our security and our economy  yes  we had work to do  but there was no reason to fear  because america  he said  stood at the ready to draw on our  voluntary heroism  sacrifice  and accomplishment when the chips are down  then we set about proving it  in february of   four months after sputnik's launch  america launched darpa  the defense advanced research projects agency  by july of that year  congress passed the national aeronautics and space act  creating nasa and ushering in the missions that would define the space race  mercury and gemini  in september   president eisenhower signed into law the national defense education act to advance at every level our ability to compete and innovate  math and science education in primary and secondary schools  college loans  graduate fellowships  vocational training  i remember as though it were yesterday when my  th grade teacher mrs  kraus came into our classroom and told us we had to study math and science because the president said so  i was convinced president eisenhower had called up mrs  kraus and told her  you tell those children and particularly that hillary  who doesn't really like math that much  that her country needs her  in   president kennedy created the apollo project  and declared that our nation would land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth by the end of the decade  by   we had done it  by   we had done it   times over  it was a national  bipartisan effort  it was a public  private partnership  we bolstered investment in research   and encouraged children to learn math and science  we asked young people to become scientists and engineers   and helped them pay for their degrees with new national science foundation fellowships  we believed that we could  by rolling up our sleeves and getting to work  do what we all knew we had to  begin to demonstrate that america still was the leader in science and innovation  we set big goals  we didn't give in to our fears  we confronted them  we didn't deny tough facts  we responded to them  we didn't ignore big challenges  we met them  once again  we proved  as president eisenhower had predicted  that when the chips are down it is always a mistake to bet against america  fifty years ago  sputnik marked the dawn of the space age and the beginning of a new era filled with new challenges  fifty years later  there is no single  galvanizing event to steel our resolve and to lift our eyes to the heavens  the challenges we face are more complex and interconnected  from the rise of globalization to the threat of global warming  these challenges require big ideas and bold thinking  but instead of fostering a climate of discovery and innovation  the bush administration has declared war on science  the record is breathtaking  banning the most promising kinds of stem cell research  allowing political appointees to censor studies on climate change  muzzling global warming experts like dr  james hansen  overruling doctors and the fda on emergency contraception  suppressing and manipulating data on mercury pollution  even delaying one report which found that   percent of women between   and   years of age have mercury levels in their blood that could harm future children  denying the risks of toxins like asbestos in the air after the   attacks  overruling scientists who sought to protect animals under the endangered species act  eliminating scientific committees at the department of health and human services that did not parrot the politically accepted ideology   or packing those committees with industry insiders  altering scientific tests on the lead content of children's lunch boxes   and appointing a lead industry consultant to a key panel formed by the centers for disease control  barring a usda researcher from publishing or even discussing his work on antibiotic resistant bacteria  censoring government websites on breast cancer research  contraception  climate change  and so much else  to paraphrase stephen colbert  this administration doesn't make decisions on facts  it makes facts based on decisions  and to further paraphrase   my predecessor  the extraordinary late senator daniel patrick moynahan  everyone is entitled to his own opinion but no one is entitled to his own facts  for six and half years under president bush  it has been open season on open inquiry  they've tried to turn washington into an evidence free zone  and by ignoring or manipulating science  the bush administration is putting our future at risk and letting our economic competitors get an edge in the global economy  well  when i am president  i will end this assault on science   applause  i will reaffirm our commitment to basic research  invest in clean energy  combat global warming  create the millions of jobs that i think come from doing both of those  reemphasize math and science education  and ensure that america is training the future innovators of our country  america will once again be the innovation nation  what america achieved after sputnik is a symbol of what americans can do now as we confront a new global economy  new environmental challenges  and the promise of new discoveries in medicine  america led in the  th century  and we saw the benefits of that  as richard referenced  probably half of our gross domestic product increase since the end of world war ii can be traced to investments in science and research in both the public and the private sector  of course fueled by non profit organizations like the carnegie institution  with a renewed commitment to scientific integrity and innovation  i know we can lead in the  st century  first  when i am president  i will lift the current ban on ethical stem cell research   applause  in   president bush issued an executive order banning federal funding for some of the most promising avenues of stem cell research  and this year   yet again   he vetoed legislation to open up new lines of embryonic stem cells for federal funding  every day  we are learning more about the opportunities this kind of research offers  within these cells may lie the cures for parkinson's disease  alzheimer's  spinal cord injuries  diabetes  huntington's and more    million americans live with these conditions   and their families live with them too  the president's ban on stem cell funding amounts to a ban on hope  it's as if these families are invisible to their president  meanwhile  our scientists and world class research institutions are hamstrung  one report found that researchers have had to set up duplicate systems and equipment to keep federally approved stem cell research efforts separate from the kind that the president has banned by executive order  in one lab  researchers use one kind of pen for federally funded research  and another for privately funded research  one stem cell scientist at university of california at san francisco was conducting research when the power went out   including the power to the freezers that held the stem cells on which she has spent two years working  there was no back up power and the only freezers cold enough were federally funded  the result  two years of research literally melting away  states have tried to pick up the slack  as have private individuals  but because states and private institutions are prohibited from doing this research in labs funded by federal dollars  even a penny of federal money disqualifies the labs  they've been forced to build new labs and buy new equipment  so instead of forging ahead on the science  we have spent money on redundancy and duplication  so far they've only been able to spend   percent of their funding on actual research  and some of our brightest minds are forced to head overseas to do their research  two renowned cancer researchers  for example  a husband and wife team  decided to leave the national cancer institute right here in our country for the institute of molecular and cell biology in singapore  one half of the pair said this   we wanted to be in a place where they are excited by science and things are moving upward  that should be america   and it can be again  but today  countries from singapore to the united kingdom are filling the biotech gap that the president has created  one report recently found that the percentage of research papers on embryonic stem cell science authored by researchers in the united states has dropped from more than a third of all published to roughly one quarter in just three years  and that negative trend may continue  when i'm president  therefore  one of my first acts will be to lift the ban on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research  but we have to go much further than that if we expect to restore scientific integrity  secondly  i will end the politicization of scientific research that has marked the bush administration and restore a climate of scientific integrity and innovation  we will no longer place ideology ahead of evidence  i'll reverse president bush's recent directive which expands the power of political appointees in agencies and reduces the role of experts  i'll stop political appointees from manipulating scientific conclusions in government publications and prevent the suppression of public statements by government scientists  we'll commit to a national assessment on climate change that goes above and beyond any requirement in the law  and i'll demand that all agencies prevent political pressure from affecting scientific research and the free and open exchange of ideas  as part of this effort  i will restore the integrity and independence of advisory committees and strengthen whistleblower protections for those who expose potential political interference  when i'm president  scientific integrity will not be the exception   it will be the rule  that's why i've been fighting for these issues in the senate  one particular battle that i led involved emergency contraception  known as plan b  which can prevent unintended pregnancies  two fda commissioners   both appointed by president bush   blocked plan b from being sold over the counter for years  overruling the fda's medical experts  advisors  and the recommendation of the american medical association  and so  teaming up with senator patty murray  we blocked two successive bush appointees for a new fda commissioner until science not politics was allowed to guide decision making  i made it very clear i was not in any way dictating  suggesting  expecting any particular outcome  but i did not want the fda politicized to achieve an outcome that was not based on the best that science and evidence had to offer  it should not take an act of congress or an act of a senator to get the president to listen to health experts on a matter of women's health  i will also have an advisor for science in the white house who reports directly to the president   applause  and i will work to restore the office of technology assessment in congress  back in the  s  this office was charged with just one task  tell us the truth about science  for decades  they cut through the myths and the spin on everything from star wars to aids prevention to solar technology  it's time we put them back in business  third  when i'm president  we will again invest in research  that's a key to creating the jobs of the future  rebuilding the middle class  and meeting the challenges of the global economy  here too  however  we're falling behind  over the past twelve years  american investment in research and development has remained relatively static  china has doubled the share of its national wealth invested in r amp d  the education pipeline  the source of future innovators  reveals the same trend  between   and   america's global share of phds in science and engineering declined from   percent to   percent  the rate is expected to drop to   percent in the next   years  at the same time  under the bush administration  spending on basic and applied research has declined in real terms four years in a row  darpa   where basic research led to the precursors of the internet  the computer mouse  stealth technology  and so much more   is putting less and less of its resources into truly revolutionary  ground breaking research  i've become troubled by this because  of course  we have very specific issues we have to address  the search for some technology to disable these horrific explosive devices that cause so much damage for our young men and women in uniform and innocent iraqis and people in afghanistan is a very important project but i think we can do both  we can do the more applied  specific research to try to solve a problem and we can continue to fund the more visionary research that we don't know where it will lead  but who knows  the next internet may come out of it  the private sector devotes only   percent of all its resources to basic research  and that is a change from   years ago and the years after that  some of the great research breakthroughs came through private labs like bell labs and others and we have not only cut back on government funding but because of the pressures of the global market place  the pressures for quarterly returns  we have seen a cutback in research in the private sector as well  the nih budget was doubled between   and   and universities and researchers had high hopes for continued funding  in the years since  the rug has been pulled out from under them  the president's budget for   actually cut funding for several departments  the consequences of unpredictable and declining resources are halted construction on new laboratories  fewer grants  uncertainty in current projects  and less support for the creative ideas of younger researchers  nobel prize winning biochemist roger kornberg recently said   in the present climate especially  the funding decisions are ultraconservative  if the work that you propose to do isn't virtually certain of success  then it won't be funded  and of course  the kind of work that we would most like to see take place  which is groundbreaking and innovative  lies at the other extreme  i visited memorial sloane kettering about a year and half ago to meet with dr  harold e  varmus another nobel prize winner who led nih with such distinction and his top staff  and at that time he very clearly said that the way that the grants and now being issued by the nih means that it's less and less likely that young researchers like he was when he did the work that eventually won him the nobel prize  could be funded  and since that time i've heard this across the country  i will increase support for basic and applied research by increasing the research budgets at the national science foundation  the department of energy's office of science  and the department of defense  we'll significantly increase funding over   years  with a greater emphasis on high risk  high return investments  that combined with the increases again in the nih to kick start our innovative engine  we'll invest more in multidisciplinary research  where the united states has a built in advantage  no one commands the breadth and depth of excellence across different fields that we do  for instance  we should increase investments in non health applications of bio technology  one example  bacteria that could dramatically reduce the costs of cleaning up superfund sites  i recently saw craig venter  who many of you know of or know  and his latest project is trying to create bacteria that will lead to a substitute for petroleum  well  we don't know where this research will lead  that's the whole point and the excitement is letting loose our best minds  the failure to modernize our health care system is also holding back research  i have proposed creating a health information technology infrastructure as part of my health care plan  the american health choices plan  i think we can lower costs for everyone  and improve quality for everyone  and cover everyone  a health information technology infrastructure is estimated by the rand corporation to save us seventy seven billion dollars a year  it will prevent errors  it will stop waste  it will cut costs  and it will save lives because it will create billions of new digital data points from which we can glean new observations  i've also called for competitive prizes to encourage innovation  back in   president eisenhower  when he met with his scientific advisory committee again  wondered if there were a way to keep people as excited about science as they were about sports and competition  and this was back when reality entertainment meant playing in the neighborhood park  why not encourage people to innovate through healthy competition  we've also seen a decline in american leadership in space exploration and science  a recent survey by the national academy of sciences found that  the nation's earth observation satellite programs  once the envy of the world  are in disarray  the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has been forced to delay the launch of important climate and weather monitoring satellites  these technologies are critical tools to study climate change  measuring the rates of melting ice  temperature and humidity changes  sea level variations  meanwhile  nasa's budget for earth sciences has been cut by   percent and nasa climate scientists have been muzzled  last year  the bush administration went so far as to remove the following phrase  and i quote   to understand and protect the home planet  end quote  from nasa's mission statement  it's no wonder  the bush administration has shown little interest in the earth sciences mission of nasa   and a hostile approach toward the study of climate change  as president  part of my mission will be to reclaim our role as the innovation leader  i will pursue an ambitious agenda in space exploration and earth sciences  i'll fully fund nasa's earth sciences program  launch a new  comprehensive space based study of climate change  and reverse the deep funding cuts that nasa's and faa's aeronautics research and development budgets have endured in the last few years  you know  this is personal for me because when i was in junior high school  i was just captivated by the space program  it caught my imagination  there was such a great burst of interest  i did my  th grade science project on space medicine  some of you know that i even wrote to nasa asking how i could apply to be an astronaut and got back an answer saying that they weren't taking women   laughter  i have lived long enough to see that change   applause  but that great burst of activity led to so many people who are the phds  who are the scientific leaders  who have made such a difference to our public life and our private sector  a lot of them are reaching retirement age  they came into school in the  's and the  's motivated by this desire to innovate and in our government we're not finding the replacement for a lot of people  i know that at the nuclear regulatory commission the workforce issue going forward is a very big one  so this is not just about let's have more scientists  this is how we run our economy and how our government retains or should i say regains competence to do what it needs to do for all of us  i think that we've got to make science research  technology  mathematics a career in those fields  exciting again  i think it's possible to do that and i think the president  even a president who doesn't know very much herself can ignite that interest with other people who are playing the lead roles in demonstrating what it means for us to be the leaders again  we really need a television series about scientists  you know  the study of forensic science skyrocketed after all these csi programs  so i'd like all of the scientists in this auditorium to start thinking  make up a character that can light the same excitement in young people because lightbulb moments require electricity and we've got to look at this challenge comprehensively  we still have a problem in women and minorities to enter science and engineering  and let's do a better job of replicating educational excellence in math and science from school to school  congress recently passed into law the america competes act which contains two of my proposals  one would study promising practices in math and science education  we have to quit reinventing the wheel   if something works in a school  especially where children come from disadvantaged backgrounds  to light their faces up  get them involved  let's replicate it  let's work to do what we can to make sure that something happening in new york or los angeles is followed in houston or miami   applause  and i think that one way we can help this is to create new fellowships at the national science foundation to allow math and science professionals to become teachers in high need schools  a lot of people who as they are retiring or are mid career are looking for some way to keep giving and they face the array of difficulties and obstacles to becoming teachers and i think we have to break through that barrier and give more people a chance to share their enthusiasm  their life's work with our young people  i've also proposed tripling the number of national science foundation fellowships and increasing the size of each award  nsf fellowships were created in response to the space race  in the decades since  the number of grants has remained largely unchanged despite a three fold increase from that time until now in the number of college students graduating with science and engineering degrees  we also  as we move toward comprehensive immigration reform have to once again open our colleges and universities to students from abroad who wish to study here and then hopefully stay here as part of the american innovation agenda  what is happening now is we're not accepting them and if we do accept them  we're not allowing them to stay and work  so we need to get the best minds from the world once again coming to america  fifth  we need an apollo like effort in clean  renewable energy  last week  the president gave a speech in which he decided to address global warming   seven years into his presidency  and what he found  unfortunately  is that the rest of the world has passed him by  he spoke of aspirational goals to reduce green house gas emissions while people around the world including right here in america actually aspire to tackle the problem  for nearly seven years  the administration has dodged  denied  and dissembled on climate change  scientists muzzled  reports censored  according to a survey of the union of concerned scientists from last year  nearly three quarters of climate scientists felt inappropriate interference with their research was going on  one particularly egregious example is that of philip a  cooney  the former chief of staff at the white house council on environmental quality  a lawyer previously employed by the american petroleum institute  he had no scientific background  nonetheless  he insisted on editing scientific documents on climate change to cast doubt and greater uncertainty than the experts felt warranted  meanwhile  the evidence has mounted  i traveled to the alaskan arctic as well as to the european arctic with senator mccain on two occasions over the last several years  we found ourselves in the northernmost inhabited place on earth  the island of svalbard  in norway  we met with scientists who'd been studying the arctic and we listened to what they had to say  they are seeing first hand the impact of changing climates   from invasive species to shifting weather patterns to melting polar ice  and then at point barrow in our most northern part of america in alaska  we heard from the scientists who have been studying climate change there for   years  as the evidence mounts   other countries are mounting a lead in the race to develop the next generation of energy technologies  nations in europe and elsewhere are working to meet the standards set by kyoto and to create jobs in the process  germany  for example  has made major commitments to renewable energy  recently upping their targets to produce more than one quarter of their energy from renewable sources by   their approach has already paid dividends  in the last two years  employment in the german renewables sector rose by   percent to   jobs  they expect to create more than   jobs in renewables by   as a german official recently told congress   solar power installations and wind turbines made in germany are an export hit all over the world  i believe america can retake the lead  energy dependence and climate change represent the greatest innovation challenge and opportunity that americans have faced in a generation   we can create millions of green collar jobs  i have proposed a   billion strategic energy fund  paid for in part by closing the tax subsidies and loopholes for the oil companies   applause  it is almost impossible to imagine but you and i and all the taxpayers in america are still subsidizing companies that have made the largest profits in the history of the world   applause  and that no longer makes sense  and we've got to move now to take our resources and put them where we create a new market  it might have made sense when oil was ten dollars a barrel because it's expensive to explore  it's expensive to extract  but that no longer is needed  if we have smart legislative policy  we would have triggers on a lot of this  if the price of oil ever did fall again dramatically  and we did have to provide incentives  we could do so  but now what we are missing by failing to provide incentives for solar and wind and geothermal and hydrogen and bio fuels and the whole array of renewable resources means that we are falling further and further behind  the fund i have proposed would invest in technologies available right now to promote conservation  combat global warming  and end our dependence on foreign oil  it also funds an energy initiative modeled on darpa  the energy advanced research projects agency to bring together the best minds in the public and the private sectors to think outside the box   and the tank   to imagine new solutions  winning the  st century energy race is as important and potentially profitable as winning the  th century space race  we can do this   applause  the strategic energy fund is only the beginning  in the coming weeks  i will outline in more detail my plans as president to move toward energy independence  instead of leading the world in oil imports  we can lead in green technology exports  the country that split the atom can end our dependence on foreign oil and launch an energy revolution  we can call it energy   because we've got everything it takes except we have not organized ourselves to make it happen  when science is politicized  when the truth is subjugated by ideology  it's worse than wrong   it's dangerous  ending the war on science and once again valuing the ever skeptical but always hopeful scientific enterprise is about more than our economy  it's about more than our security  it is about our democracy  vannevar bush  no relation  among his many accomplishments as an advisor to presidents beginning with franklin delano roosevelt  as a pioneering scientist  as a leader who helped shape decades of science policy for our nation  also served as president of this institution  he authored a report at the close of world war ii  requested by president roosevelt but delivered to president truman  in that report  dr  bush laid out his vision for the future of scientific progress in america proposing  for example  the national science foundation  he described science as the  endless frontier  what could be more american that  i was heartened to learn that after sputnik went up sales of telescopes and binoculars shot up as well  actually in my house  my father went out and bought some binoculars  so we could be on the lookout for sputnik  and my memory of that  of peering into the sky in our backyard in a suburb of chicago  i don't think we ever saw it although my friends claim that they had seen it  was so exciting that somehow we were connected to what that meant  and it was not only a thrill for a young girl  but it really did start me thinking  fear is no match for the human desire to reach for the stars  and with the right leadership fear gives way to fortitude  to resolve  and to evidence based action  the free and open exchange of ideas in america  along with our entrepreneurial spirit  our work ethic  and our values  has always been the wind against our backs  it was true in the space race for the  th century  and it will be true again in the global innovation race of the  st century  thank you all very much  thank you "], ["clinton", "i want to introduce one other person  i don't know quite where she is right now but mary jo auliff  where is mary jo  is mary jo here  well mary jo auliff i know was going to try to be here this morning and she is someone whom i met in iowa city this past weekend  it turns out that mary jo and i went to the same high school  maine east  just a couple of hours from here in park ridge  illinois  she now lives in leclair with her husband russell  they have six sons  two of whom have served in iraq  and they both work  they work hard russell is a fourth generation iowa farmer and mary jo runs her own small business  but because both mary jo and russell have pre existing health conditions  they cannot afford insurance so they pay for their healthcare out of pocket    a month for prescription drugs alone  when russell got sick  and the medical bills started piling up  they had to sell off half of their farm to pay their medical bills  it was their only option  mary jo  russell and their family are doing everything right  they're working hard  they're serving our country  they're taking responsibility for themselves and taking care of each other  there are millions of families like them struggling and coming up short in an economy that just doesn't work for middle class americans any longer  today i would like to outline several of the challenges that this economy and our people face  globalization  rising income inequality  the growing housing crisis  all at a time of unprecedented fiscal irresponsibility in washington  this administration has failed to respond to these challenges and in fact  many of their policies have made things worse  i will chart a new course as president  we have to change our economic course just as we have to change course in iraq  and change course when it comes to health care  when it comes to the economy  i believe i have the strength and experience to make that change   and to make our economy work again for middle class americans  and for all americans  because in this new global economy  what have we seen  we've seen some jobs shipped overseas  and others replaced with machines  in this decade the jobs that had been created pay   less than the jobs we've lost  it's an economy that doesn't even create many new jobs  job growth  since   under president bush  has been the weakest of any economic recovery since the great depression  it's an economy that demands more from our workers and gives less in return  over the past six years  worker productivity   that means how hard you're working  how much you put out per hour of your work  productivity has risen   american workers are the hardest working people in the world  and yet just look around  wages have stayed flat  corporate profits are at a forty year high but the average family's income in america has fallen by nearly   income that is sorely missed as college costs have risen   health care premiums have doubled  and gas prices have more than doubled  according to a recent report  over the  month period that ended in july of last year  the slow growth in wages for labor accounted for   of the increase in corporate profits  so in other words  companies are actually profiting off of their worker's stagnant wages  that is not the way it used to be  it used to be that when corporate profits went up  workers wages went up  but the current group of corporate leadership is not sharing the benefits of that increasing profitability with the workers who make the profits possible  it's an economy where the gap between the few at the top and everybody else just keeps getting wider  in   all income gains went to the top   of households  while  the bottom   saw their incomes decline  and the wealthiest   held   of america's income  now it used to be less than   thirty years ago  this is the highest level of income inequality since   hardly a red letter year for america  and six and a half years of fiscal irresponsibility hasn't helped matters  between the president's reckless tax breaks to those at the top and a war that is costing   a day  we have run up record debts and we are now at   trillion and counting  now up until recently  at least housing prices were rising    between   and   so while hard working families were getting squeezed from every direction  and their credit cards were often maxed out  they'd use their homes as a safety net  when the bills got too high  they could dip in to their home equity to pay them  then housing prices started to fall  and suddenly the safety net shrunk  at the same time  families who financed their homes with non traditional high risk loans saw their mortgage rates jump  now many families finally stuck with mortgages they can't pay and expenses they can't afford  the result is   million foreclosures so far this year  filings in august alone were up   in iowa  and home prices are expected to decline this year  the first annual nation wide drop since housing agencies began keeping records in   alex pollick  the former ceo of the federal home loan bank of chicago  recently testified before congress and said that the problems in the housing market could cost america   trillion in household wealth  and while we all hope that the housing markets woes remain contained  experts worry that the prices in the housing market could spread throughout the economy  we're already seeing some early warning signs  consumer confidence has weakened  the pace of employment growth has slowed even more since the beginning of this year  automakers are recording that the housing prices is hurting auto sales and big investment banks are writing off billions in investments and starting layoffs tied to the housing industry  so taken together  the pressures of stagnant wages  rising health  education  and energy costs  increased household debt  and a softening housing market are creating a trap door economy  too many families are standing on that trap door  just one diagnosis  one pink slip  one missed mortgage payment away from falling through and losing everything they've worked for  they're bearing all of the risks of the global economy but reaping few of the rewards  so i hear all over as i travel throughout iowa and america  people asking me  people asking themselves   what am i going to do ' and i think it's fair to ask our leaders   what are you going to do ' well for six and a half years we've seen this administration's answers  their answer to jobs being outsourced  continuing tax incentives to companies that outsource jobs to tax havens  their answer to rising inequality  tax breaks for the wealthy that actually increase inequality  their answer to   million americans without health care  veto health care for five million children from working families  their answer to rising insecurity  shift even more risk onto the individual by trying to privatize social security  their answer to stagnant wages and anemic job growth  a war on science that has slowed the critical research we need to create the high wage jobs of the future  their economic philosophy boils down to this  in the new global economy  according to the republicans  america can't win unless most americans lose  think about it  that's basically what they're telling us  you know  just go along with it  some folks are doing really well  that's what we think it takes to compete and win  and everybody else  we're sorry but we just can't help you  now middle class families always end up drawing the short straw  growth  according to this republican philosophy  has to be unequal and government can't help  instead  the bush administration gives no bid contracts to political allies  allows no competition for senior citizens' drug prices under medicare  and assumes no accountability for outsourcing national security responsibilities to contractors like blackwater  they won't spend money to help working families get health insurance for their kids  but think nothing of giving health care providers billions more to take medicare patients off the rolls  well  my economic philosophy is exactly the opposite  it's what i learned growing up in a middle class family in the middle of america  my father came back from world war ii after having served in the navy  and he worked hard to build up his small business  he believed you should avoid being in debt at all costs and instilled in me the importance of being responsible with a budget at an early age  it's a value i still hold dear today  but it's that determination that i saw in my own family that i see across this state and across our country  that work ethic that has created the great american middle class  i believe the middle class is the backbone of our economy  the key to real growth  and the guarantor of the american dream  and to paraphrase an old saying  as america's middle class goes  so goes america  and so i judge the health of our economy very differently than the way this white house judges it  i ask whether our middle class is expanding and getting ahead  are we on the road to a stronger  more prosperous middle class or not  the administration has failed that test  my administration will not  we will get back to making it clear that we will have policies that support the american middle class and that will be our goal  you know  you can go back in american history and see it works  throughout our history  whenever we've made strategic investments in our people and our future  the american economy has created unprecedented prosperity  it has spurred scientists to make new discoveries  entrepreneurs to launch new industries  it's generated countless rags to riches stories and produced more millionaires and billionaires than anywhere else on earth  at the same time  it has sustained the world's largest  strongest middle class and given poor people the chance to work their way into the middle class  and left each generation more prosperous than the one before  the strength of our economy and the rise of the middle class were products of both a free market and good public policy  including sound economic stewardship by presidents from both parties  think about teddy roosevelt busting the trusts and rooting out corruption  franklin roosevelt building the infrastructure that drove this century's economy  president truman ensuring that american gis had the tools they needed to seize the promise of a great and growing future  president eisenhower supporting more science and math education  president kennedy set our sights on the moon and president johnson worked to end poverty and the insecurity that comes as we grow older  in the  s  my husband continued this tradition  combining fiscal responsibility with smart investments in our people  and we did have pay as you go rules that helped to rein in spending  and look at the results  more than   million new jobs and the longest economic expansion in american history  balanced budgets and record surpluses  rising family incomes  record levels of home and business ownership  and one hundred times as many people lifted out of poverty than during the reagan administration  the secret to america's past economic success is clear  whenever the economy changed  we changed with it and we mastered it  we innovated  we invested  we managed downturns and overcame them  and we generated wealth and we made sure that wealth was widely shared  well in the  s we were on our way to creating good jobs  with shared prosperity and the prospect of being debt free and having the resources to fund the retirement costs of the baby boom generation  then we came to george w  bush  well  it's a sad story  president bush  with a republican congress that enabled him to fully implement the trickle down economics they've been advocating for a generation  ignored a century's worth of wisdom  in this decade  no american was too wealthy to be denied big tax cuts  no well connected company too prosperous to lose its tax subsidies or protection from competition for government money  meanwhile america's middle class families have been invisible to the president  it's as if he's looked right through them  as college got more expensive  they cut back on college aid  so if you're a young person who can't afford tuition  you're invisible  as health care got more expensive  they tried to reduce coverage for children  so if you're one of the   million americans without health insurance  you're invisible as well  as jobs got scarce and paid less  they tried to weaken unions and stopped enforcing our trade laws  so if you're a worker who can't organize for fair wages and safe working conditions  you're invisible too  and as gas prices exploded  they allowed us to become more dependent on foreign oil  so if you pay through the roof every time you fill up your tank  you're invisible  well you're not invisible to me  and when we take back the white house  you will no longer be invisible to the president of the united states  because i do see you and i do hear you  i see families working as hard as they can  i see young people eager for opportunity  i see workers fighting for their basic rights  and i will fight for you every single day of my presidency  because as president  i want to bring a new beginning to the  st century and build a new road to middle class prosperity  that is in my view the job of the next president  to restore broad economic prosperity  fairness  and security  it won't be easy  but i know it can be done  i saw that for myself in the eight years in the white house as my husband carried out one of the most dramatic economic turnarounds in america's history  and for nearly seven years  as a senator from new york i have been working to build on that commitment  to support good economic policies  resist bad ones  and help  working with local people  to bring economic opportunity to depressed regions of my state  today i propose a new economic blueprint for the twenty first century economy  a plan to create the new  good jobs essential to broad based prosperity  to restore fairness to our economy  and to renew that basic bargain that if you work hard you can get ahead and we will put our fiscal house in order  the first component of my plan is to create millions of new jobs through an all out commitment to a clean  efficient  independent energy future and to end this administration's assault on science so that innovation can once again be the engine of our economic growth  for six and a half years  this administration first denied the reality of our dependence on foreign oil and then denied the reality of climate change and refused to make a serious effort to deal with either  it is heartbreaking to know we are more dependent on foreign oil today than we were before   you know  but this on the part of the president was just a small piece of a larger war on science and innovation  from muzzling and overruling scientists  to suppressing and manipulating scientific evidence  to denying funding for stem cell research  to paraphrase stephen colbert  this administration doesn't make decisions based on facts  it makes facts based on decisions  and as a result  our competitors around the world are getting an edge on us in the global economy  i want to restore america to its rightful place as the innovation nation  new discoveries  new inventions are key to new jobs and prosperity  i'll start by issuing an executive order to end the war on science and restore a climate of scientific integrity and independence  this order will rescind president bush's ban on stem cell research and ensure that government scientists  i will also dramatically increase investments in basic and applied research at the national science foundation  the national institutes of health  our universities  and so many other entities that will take advantage of the tax credit for research and experimentation  and i want to invest in the idea leaders of tomorrow by improving math and science education  expanding fellowships for graduate study  and encouraging more women and minorities to choose careers in science and engineering  to jumpstart our investment in alternative energy  i will establish a   billion strategic energy fund to develop clean energy technologies like biomass and bio fuels grown right here in iowa to combat global warming and end our dependence on foreign oil  we'll pay for the strategic energy fund by eliminating the tax subsidies for the big oil companies and requiring them to pay into the fund  i would give them an option  if they are willing to invest in alternative  clean  green technologies themselves then they won't have to pay into the fund  they won't get the tax subsidies because there is no reason for us to be subsidizing them  our oil companies have made record profits on the energy system that has reduced our incomes  accelerated climate change  and undermined our national security  it's time from them finally to do their part to build a new energy economy that benefits all americans and secures our children's future  we are seeing what the future could be right here in iowa  you're leading the way on harnessing the power of alternative energy to create good new jobs  a few months back i visited with some young men in crawfordsville  they had grown up on farms and they left home to go to school and they were working elsewhere around the country  they started talking about maybe they could actually go home  use what they learned growing up on a farm and make biodiesel fuel and that's what they did  they started a small business and now they have   employees and a   million gallon capacity  countries around the world are moving much faster than we are  employment for example in germany in the renewables sector has risen by   percent in the past two years to   new jobs  they expect to create more than   jobs  there's no reason we can't do the same here in america  i will also harness the power of innovation to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure  this is a problem that if we don't deal with it we're going to be slowing our economic growth  economists estimate that every   billion spent on fixing crumbling infrastructure creates nearly   new jobs  my rebuild america plan invests   billion over ten years in an  emergency repair fund  to begin addressing the extensive backlog of emergency repairs needed in our country  we need to modernize our roads  our rail systems  our seaports  our public transit systems  and to expand broadband access across america  i've also proposed a   billion per year  green building fund  to build and renovate public buildings and make them green and energy efficient and the mayor is applauding and i know he understands it  i believe we can innovate our way to  st century manufacturing  now i know there are people in america who say we can't be a manufacturing economy any longer and i don't believe that  first of all  i don't want to believe it because i think that a country that doesn't make things is a country that is on a slow slide to income inequality and a rogue economy  but i also believe we have opportunities here that we need to take advantage of  i'm proud to be the co chair of the senate manufacturing caucus  it's bipartisan  we've worked to come up with ideas that the bush administration wouldn't implement but i would as president because i want to incentivize manufacturing in america  and this is just the beginning  later this week  i'll be outlining an additional set of innovation initiatives  building on proposals that i've been making through this campaign as well as some new ones  but in addition to creating new jobs with rising incomes to be globally competitive  we've got to do more to restore fairness to our economy  to empower our workers and ensure that all americans get their fair share  that starts with standing up for our unions so that they can stand up for our workers  unionized workers make   more money than workers who aren't in unions  i want to put that up in a great big billboard because a lot of people don't know that the difference is that dramatic  but today just   of our private sector workplace is unionized  millions of other people whose jobs are not covered are much more vulnerable to unsafe working conditions  being deprived of benefits  not getting their fair share when it comes to the income they receive for the jobs they do  if more people in america earned higher incomes with better benefits  their consumer spending would increase and that would benefit the entire economy  this should not be a zero sum game where we have winners at the top and losers down the income scale  we need to get back to a win win strategy where we try to empower americans not only to have a better life for themselves and their families but to be greater contributors to our overall prosperity  as president  i will fight to pass the employee free choice act so unions can organize for fair wages and safe working conditions  you know it used to be in america when the middle class was stronger it was a lot easier to sign up to join a union  and the reason this is such an important issue  even if you're not in a union  maybe you don't understand why this is such a big deal  why people stood up and applauded  is that back when we had a strong middle class that was really growing and people were getting a standard of living that their parents and grandparents would not have dreamed of  it was a lot easier  now  with republican presidents and republican congresses  it's become so hard and there is harassment and there is intimidation and the employers really just push people so that they don't feel that a union is in their interest  i want people to make up their own minds  you know  it's a free country  if you can decide to join a civic organization you should be able to decide to join a union without fear of coercion and if you don't want to decide to join one  well that's your choice as well  unlike the current president  i will actually appoint people to the department of labor and the national labor relations board who are pro labor and care about working people  and i will work from day one to ensure that our trade policies actually work for american workers  that they include strong enforceable protections for labor and environmental standards  and that they deliver benefits not just for trading partners  not just for the people at the top of the income scale in america  but for all americans  because look at what has happened in the past six years  our trade deficit has doubled in just six years to   billion a year  the economic policy institute estimates that we've lost   million jobs to china  we're paying higher prices for low cost consumer goods some of which have serious safety problems  now the last   years may have been great for china  but is it the best course for america going forward  i don't think so  it's time for a new approach  one that doesn't lead to a race to the bottom  but instead ensures that ordinary citizens not ceo's but people who do the work in america and in other nations come out ahead again  i will start by appointing a trade enforcement officer within the united states trade representative's office who will be responsible for vigorously enforcing trade agreements  and i will double the size of the enforcement unit  the bush administration has filed roughly the same number of enforcement actions under our trade agreements that were filed during one year of the clinton administration  that is unacceptable  they're abdicating their responsibility  no one should get away with violating trade agreements  and when i'm president  we're going to start enforcing them again and we're not going to enter into them unless we think they're going to be good for american workers  next i will work to address specific problems with nafta  as i've said before  this agreement has some serious shortcomings  for example  i did a study last year in new york looking at the impact of nafta on our business people  our workers and our farmers because we share a long boarder with canada  but what people were telling me whom i represent is they could not get their products into canada despite nafta's promise of equal access  and i did a study and i sent it to the bush administration and i said i want answers as to why this is not working  you know i have apple farmers up along the boarder  they couldn't get their apples in but apples were coming out of canada  i had business people who couldn't figure out how to get through all of the red tape to get their products in  but products were coming out of canada  now we have a great relationship with canada  but i think it is time that we assess trade agreements every five years to make sure they're meeting their goals or make adjustments if they are not and we should start with doing that with nafta  and finally  i will overhaul our trade adjustment assistance program to ensure that workers who've lost their jobs because of global competition get the income support  the health care  the job training and the job placement assistance they need to get back on their feet  you know the trade adjustment assistance program is a lifeline for workers across america who can use it  unfortunately too few people can use it  first  service workers whose jobs are lost to outsourcing should be able to be eligible to receive taa benefits  it makes no sense to keep excluding service workers because we know we're losing a lot of service jobs overseas  second  taa should cover all workers whose plants have moved abroad whether or not the plant moved to a country with which we have a free trade agreement  believe it or not  trade adjustment assistance currently does not cover workers whose jobs are outsourced to china and india because we don't have free trade agreements with them  i want to double the funding for the job training program under taa to   million a year and increase taa tax credits to help displaced workers pay for health insurance  now ultimately under my american health choices plan  workers will be able to buy into the federal employees health benefits plan  the same program that insures members of congress  i will also work to restore fairness to our tax system  first i will return to the income tax rates for upper income americans that we had in the  s  those rates were consistent with a balanced budget and economic growth  and i will level the playing field when it comes to taxes on income  right now  wall street investment managers making   million a year pay just   on their earnings because they classify what they do as ordinary income  as not ordinary income  but as capital gains  when they go to work everyday  they manage all this money  but they say what they're doing is an investment  not management  well a teacher making     a year pays   those who have been most richly rewarded by the modern economy should not pay lower tax rates on their incomes than nurses or home health care workers or bus drivers or machinists or anybody else and we are going to make sure that they no longer do  for middle class americans  i will extend the tax cuts including the child tax credit  the marriage penalty relief  and lower income tax rates that they currently pay  and i will reform something called the alternative minimum tax  the amt  to make sure it doesn't hit middle class families with higher tax rates  it was never intended to do that  i will also expand the earned income tax credit to help families that are struggling to join the middle class  and i will be providing tax credits to help small businesses pay for health care  i want to take a hard look at corporate tax reform as well  it is simply not right that as corporate profits have skyrocketed  the percentage of taxes paid by corporations has fallen  we can fix that if we close the loopholes  end the unjustifiable tax breaks  and stop subsidizing the movement of jobs to foreign tax havens  we're going to get that done  the third component of my plan is to restore america's basic bargain  if you work hard you can get ahead because you'll have the tools and support you need to succeed in the global economy  that starts with recommitting ourselves to making college affordable for young people  you know i was in new hampshire yesterday morning and a young man stood up and asked a question  he said he was a high school senior  he wanted to go to college  he hoped eventually he could even go to law school  he said where am i going to get the financial help to do that  he said i'm one of the top students in my class and i'm afraid i won't be able to afford to do what i want to do to pursue my dreams  well on thursday i will outline my plan for making college affordable  including modernizing the hope scholarship program that provides tax credits to help young people attend college  we know that we've got to improve the skills and education of our workforce  but today  and i have to confess i was surprised  i asked to find out the statistic but even i was surprised    of students at america's best public and private universities and colleges come from the top   of income in america  think about that  so that leaves   for everybody else  just   of the students come from the bottom   of income  it didn't used to be like this  we used to believe that if you worked hard and you were college material  you would go to college  we clearly need to make college accessible so that students from all different backgrounds have the chance to fulfill their god given potential  and for those who don't attend four year colleges  and who need skills and training  let's provide more support for community colleges and institutions that help prepare them for good  high paying jobs  about a year and a half ago i had two meetings within the space of one week  i had a meeting with the auto dealers from new york who came to see me and they said  you know  senator  we have   good jobs for auto mechanics right now that we can't get filled because nobody's training auto mechanics any longer  and the job is more complicated because we all have these computers in our cars  you know  they talk to us and tell us which way to turn and all that  and the auto dealers say we don't know what to do so we're going to start our own school because we don't know where we're going get people to do this important job  shortly after that i had a visit from some of the members of the machinist union that i work with in new york  they told me they were worried about the aging of the machinists on airplanes  the workforce is getting older  what were we going to do to have a pipeline with more young people  so  this is a problem that we should begin to handle now  we have a lot of decent hardworking young and not so young people who deserve to have a good job  and i believe skilled workers will be in a shortage in the future  so let's start giving them the tools they need to be competitive right now  and of course i outlined my health care plan to ensure that every american has quality  affordable health care  you know  the american health choices plan is really simple  if you have insurance you like  you keep it  if you don't have insurance or don't like the insurance you have  you can choose from the same menu of private plans available to members of congress or you can opt into a new public plan that will be like medicare  we'll provide those tax credits to make it affordable and your coverage will be guaranteed even if you lose your job  even if it is outsourced  and if you decide to start your own business or stay home with your children for a few years  you will never be denied coverage because of pre existing conditions or risk factors  i believe we can save   billion a year in our health care system  if we emphasize prevention  which we don't do now  if we emphasize chronic care management  which we don't do very well now  if we move toward electronic medical records so we don't keep losing medical records and people are told they have to take the same test twice  three times over and when you travel from iowa to see your family in illinois or florida you can have that record at your fingertips  so  there's a lot we can do  and that will also create new jobs  and finally another component of the basic bargain is homeownership  years of progress on this front are threatened by the growing problems in the housing market and i think we have to address this crisis immediately  if home prices keep falling  many families will soon find themselves with mortgages larger than the value of their homes  at that point  they won't be able to refinance  so we don't have any time to waste  i've already announced a four part plan to address mortgage industry abuses  crack down on unscrupulous brokers  curb unfair lending practices  support state and community initiatives that help families avoid foreclosure  and increase the supply of affordable housing in america again  today i'm announcing three new proposals  the first is what i'm calling the save our homes program to rescue families trapped in unworkable mortgages    billion dollars worth of adjustable rate mortgages are resetting in october and approximately   billion will reset every month thereafter for the next year  that means hundreds of thousands of americans will see their mortgage rates jump and too many will go into default  the save our homes program will enable these two federally chartered entities  fannie mae and freddie mac  as well as state housing finance agencies  to replace these unworkable mortgages with stable  fixed rate loans that families can afford  my second proposal is the realizing the dream program to make more mortgage credit available to responsible homebuyers now  right now because of market conditions  many banks are reluctant to write mortgages even for responsible  credit worthy buyers  they're especially reluctant to write mortgages larger than those that fannie mae and freddie mac can buy from them  so my plan would temporarily increase the size of the mortgages that fannie and freddie  as we call them in washington  can purchase and that would encourage more banks to continue making loans to more americans  my third proposal is a foreclosure rescue fraud act to crack down on the unscrupulous consultants  i already said let's crack down on the unscrupulous brokers  now we've got a whole new field of unscrupulous consultants that are knocking on the doors of people who are at risk of losing their homes  they're claiming to be able to help homeowners avoid foreclosure  they're taking hefty fees and they're disappearing  no actual assistance   spread the word  anybody you know  don't listen to anybody who calls you on the phone or knocks on your door and tells you they've got a great way of saving your home  if it's too good to be true  it probably isn't true  so what i want to do is to create a federal statute imposing criminal penalties on these fraudulent consultants and allow victims to collect damages so that they don't get even more victimized  as you know in america  homeownership isn't just the key to financial security  it's about laying down roots in your community and building the life you want for you and your family  and i will make sure that the dream of homeownership is not lost  and i will also protect retirement security  we're going to stand up for social security and medicare  i'll be outlining in more detail my plan to help americans save  invest  and build wealth for retirement tomorrow because we know we've got to tackle that as well  and i don't think we can do all of this unless we return america to fiscal responsibility  and what we've seen from this president is increased spending at more than double the rate of the previous administration  anybody who tells you that the republicans are the party of fiscal responsibility  just roll your eyes because the facts could not be more different  how has president bush paid for these tax cuts to multi millionaires  oil companies  and other interest groups  how has he paid for the war in iraq and the no bid contracts and the tax cuts that seem to have no end in sight  i'll tell you how he's done it  he's run record deficits and he's borrowed money from foreign countries like china  when he took office we had those budget surpluses and we were on track to be debt free in a few years  now with a national debt of   trillion  up nearly   since president bush took office  he's left our children and our grandchildren to pay the bill  did you know that every baby born in america today starts life with   of national debt on his or her tiny shoulders  that is the largest birth tax in history  and trillions of it is owed to countries like china  and japan  and korea  and middle east producers of oil  we even owe money to mexico  put simply  we are borrowing money from abroad to give tax cuts to president bush's friends and special interests  so when people ask me  why is it so hard to get tough on china and other trading partners  i tell them because they've been turned into our bankers  we owe them  how can we truly enforce trade laws against a country like china whose manipulated currency puts us at unfair disadvantage  but our economic stability depends on them continuing to provide massive loans to us every single month  i want america back in control of our fiscal destiny  it may take a few years but we have to move back toward a balanced budget and a surplus  we have to find a way both to increase long term investment and to stop borrowing money from other countries for current consumption  whether it's for our soldiers in the field or for tax cuts for millionaires  we have to develop a set of budget rules similar to those we had in the  s that required us to fund new expenditures with new revenues or cut spending  i think it's going to be a challenge to do this but i believe this is the change that america wants  if we do it right  we will spark broadly shared prosperity even greater than the growth we enjoyed in the  s  i look at the world we're in now and yes i see a lot of threats  a lot of challenges  but i see tremendous opportunities  seventy one years ago this month during a campaign stop in kansas city  missouri  president franklin roosevelt said   to a greater degree than any other peoples  we have sought to give each rising generation a little better chance in life than the one that preceded it  he spoke also of our  faith in the future   a faith under which america has only begun to march  well  it's time for america to march again  toward rebuilding our middle class and restoring our faith in the future our children and grandchildren deserve  it's a forward march i want to lead and i hope you will give me the honor to do that  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", "i want to thank the ywca for opening their doors to us today  i'm a big supporter of the y  and i've worked with the ywca for many years on issues having to do with women and girls  and the crisis services and support that is provided and particularly the tools that the y helps parents acquire to raise strong healthy children  and provide what i see as the village  they are part of village  it takes a village to raise a child  and the y has been an absolutely essential part of that village here in manchester and beyond i want to thank monica zoloff  the director of the y  and her staff  i want to thank my old friend senator betsey devries who has been a strong supporter of the y and the work that it does in the community  i also want to recognize tom donavan the democratic nominee for the mayor of manchester   inaudible  i look forward to working with you and a lot of people are very excited about your campaign  you know  marcy's story is all too familiar  you know you have to take an unpaid leave of absence when you're pregnant  you have to take vacation days to care for your sick children  you're stretched to the breaking point by the cost of raising two kids on your own  you know  raising a family in today's world is hard under any circumstances  i actually think that it's harder today than when i was a young parent  there's just so much going on and the cost of everything's going up  and all of the incoming influences over your children you really have no control over  and doing it by yourself makes it more than doubly hard  and so everywhere i go i see the anxiety and the frustration of families trying to strike a balance between their obligations at home and those at work  you know  from the parents of young children who are caught at the office or the work place long into the night  to the adult children who are both caring for aging parents and raising their own children  to the young women who often come up to me after i finish speaking and ask how i balance a family and work  now i've been fortunate to have so much support as a working mother  but i understand what it means to be pulled in a million directions at once  the panic of having to get up early to get to an appointment when your child has a fever of   and the child care center is closed or the babysitter is sick  i remember one time i had to be in court when i was a young lawyer  chelsea was a baby  we had a woman who did come in and help me she' come in early then after that she'd go home  chelsea was sick and the babysitter wasn't there and then she called and she was sick too  and it was just that gut wrenching feeling and i was lucky enough to have a friend who could come over and watch chelsea while i ran to court then ran back home  but i know that happens every day  and there's so many pressures on young parents  or the little mental bell that goes off in your head at the exact moment school lets out and you reflexively reach for the phone to check in and make sure your child has made it home safely  and if you have fewer resources  greater challenges  or an unsympathetic employer  then the struggle to balance family and work can simply be overwhelming  too many americans today feel trapped between being there for their kids and being a good there for their employer  and our government's policies have just not kept up with the new realities of american life  the traditional family   the way i was raised  with one breadwinner and one homemaker   is now the exception rather than the rule  today    percent of families with children are headed by two working parents or by an unmarried working parent  and the economy is changing as well  over the past six years  americans are actually working harder than ever before  and if you look at the surveys  americans work harder than anybody else in the world  and yet family incomes have dropped by nearly   for all that hard work it's not paying off in material terms to help buy a little more faith and maybe a little more help in dealing with these obligations  at the same time  health care premiums have nearly doubled  college costs are up   and gas prices have more than doubled  highly skilled workers are working more hours than ever  and lower skilled workers often need to take an extra job just to get by  as a result  american parents have twenty two fewer hours a week to spend with their kids than they did back in   and   two thirds percent  two thirds of all of working parents say they do not have enough time with their children  now  the family and medical leave act has been a significant step forward in the struggle to balance work and family    million americans have benefitted from this act  which guarantees   weeks of unpaid leave for the birth of a child  to care for a sick relative  or to tend to a personal medical problem  however  family and leave only covers those who work for businesses with   employees or more  and the leave is unpaid  now  i've had countless people come up to thank me and thank my husband for family and medical leave but a lot of people don't know about it or can't afford to take it  so it's been a tremendous help  but it leaves so many americans out  but too few of those who are eligible  even for unpaid leave  can take advantage of it  i'm particularly worried about those critical days and weeks that really are important for bonding between new parents and their own children when they're forced to go back to work  three out of four workers who report that they needed leave  but didn't take it  cited lost wages as the principal reason  you know  the sad fact is that our country is only one of a handful of countries that don't guarantee a legal right to paid maternity leave  and in the us only   percent of men have access to paid paternity leave  and less than   percent of women with a high school degree receive paid maternity leave  now  for professional women  the story is somewhat better  access to paid leave has steadily risen   from   percent in the  s to   percent in the  s  i remember when i was pregnant i was working as a lawyer  the firm had never had a pregnant lawyer  and i just kept ignoring i was pregnant and the lawyers just kept sort of walking down the hall looking away and nobody would talk about it because i didn't know what i was supposed to say and they certainly didn't know what they were supposed to say  and so chelsea came early and i was actually ending a trial and thinking  gosh now i'll have three weeks  maybe a month to get ready  and she must have had a different time table  so the morning after she was born i'm in the hospital and one of the partners in the law firm calls me up and says  well  i heard you had a baby  and i said  yeah that's what usually happens when you're pregnant  and he said  well  want me to pick you up on the way to work  i took that as a joke  i said   well no  and he said   what are you going to do  i said   no no no  let me think about this  so you know  i was able to take time off  and i relished that time  i don't know what i would have done without it  because as i once told chelsea late one night  she was crying inconsolably  i said   chelsea you've never done a baby before  i'm never done a mother before  we're just going to have to work to figure this out  and we had the time to do that  but a lot of young mothers don't  and i think that's bad for them  i think it's bad for their babies  and i think that's bad for all of us  because you don't get that good beginning that really the foundation to so much more that is going to lead to success  so i think we've got to take a hard look  not only though at what happens with trying to care for children  but now increasingly for aging parents  you know  we have nearly half of our workers who work in the private sector    million workers altogether in our country who have no sick days at all  and that means that it's really hard when you're responsible for an aging parent who has to get to the doctor  when there may be a parent who may live far from where you're living now  and you need time to go to make sure that he or she is okay  we have a lot of figures that show how much productivity we're losing in the economy because we're not figuring out a way to help family members do what we want them to do  which is care for each other  a flexible schedule would give caregivers an enormous amount of help  i think we should look for ways to do that  and certainly a lot of women who are employed with children  more than   would prefer to work part time  but that's not in the cards  because it's hard to manage that and it often doesn't pay enough to make it work for them  so i think that part of what we have to do is get real about what's happening with families today  i want to make it easer for people both to work and to fulfill their most important responsibilities  it's as though a lot of people in our society just feel like they're struggling all by themselves  and i think it's time we brought this conversation out into the open  you know  if you're a worker who gets sick but doesn't have sick days  well you are invisible  and if you're a single mom who can't afford childcare then you're invisible too  and if you're a parent who can't take time off to take your child to the doctor or to care for your aging parents  well  then you're invisible  and if you're a new mom  that wants to spend those critical early weeks bonding with their child  whether it's your birth child or an adopted child  and your fortunes turn to work  well you feel pretty invisible as well  middle class americans may be invisible to george bush  but they're not going to be invisible to me  and when we take back the white house they will no longer be invisible to the president of the untied states  it's time for a new administration that actually cares about the middle class  it's time for change of course in this country  we have to change our economic course  we have to change our course in iraq  and change course when it comes to health care  the bush economy has be en a trap door economy  too many families are just one diagnosis  one pink slip  one missed mortgage payment away from falling through  it's time once again to say  that america is only as strong as its middle class  and one of the keys to strengthening the middle class is supporting middle class families  that's why i've been so passionate about reauthorizing the children's health insurance program that i helped to create  and that's why i've been so outraged over the republican attack on this  and let me tell you one story that made me really angry  the story about a   year old boy named graeme frost  he was in a terrible car accident  but thanks goodness he was covered by the children's health insurance program  and recently graham and his family came to congress  to ask us to cover more children  but the president doesn't want to do that  so the republican attack machine went after graham  a   year old boy  well they can come after me any time  but shame on them for attacking a child  and shame on them for opposing health care for our children  i think we've had enough of this cruel and destructive politics in america  and as president i'm going to return our focus to supporting middle class and hard working families  especially when it comes to caring for children  an issue that i've worked on my entire life  during law school i focused on how the law affects kids  after i graduated i turned down law firms to go door to door for the children's defense fund  trying to figure out why so many children weren't enrolled at school  that led to the landmark federal special education law  during my years in arkansas  i founded a group called arkansas advocates for children and family and developed a scholarship program to support single moms  when bill was elected president  i worked very hard to support the family medical leave act and would proud it was the first bill that he signed into law  it's been such a success that it's hard to remember how controversial it once was  it was actually vetoed twice before my husband was elected  and i want to pay special tribute to my colleague and friend senator chris dodd who was the champion of the family medical leave act for all of those years  i also worked to create early head start  to ensure investment in head start and childcare funding  and i planned and to carried out the historic white house conferences on early childhood development and childcare  i continued this work in the senate   inaudible  legislation i offered to provide respite care for family caregivers  a bill to give families more flexibility in finding child care  and grandparents more help in raising their grandchildren  i co sponsored legislation to provide seven paid sick days a year to help parents care for sick parents or children  and i've worked with flan the family medical leave act  and to extend it for up to   months for family caring for wounded soldiers  but as far as we've come  it's clear that we have a long way to go  i'll never forget a newspaper advice column i read in the early  's  i was working at a law firm and my daughter was about   years old  someone had written this advice column  and they asked i'm about to get a big promotion and i'm going to have my own office  what kind of decorations are appropriate for my office  well the advice columnist responded that he needed to know if the writer was a man or a woman because it would affect his answer  if you're a man  he wrote  and you have a family  put up lots of pictures of your family because people will think to themselves this is a stable person with good family values  but if you're a woman  don't put out any pictures of your family in the office  because people will think you can't keep your mind on the job  well of course i immediately filled my little office with family pictures  because i thought that that would  inaudible  now  that was a long time ago  but it still sums up the attitude of america's policies toward women and parents in the workplace  keep your family life to yourself and don't let your family affect your work  well  i think we've had enough of that  it's about time we stopped just talking about family values and started pursuing policies that truly value families  so today  i'm handing out my agenda that i hope will make a difference in helping young families particularly strike that balance between family and work  for me this is a very personal issue because we all have a stake in the next generation  sometimes people say to me well if you just focus on families with children  well that's unfair to everybody else but i couldn't disagree more  today kids are tomorrow's doctors and nurses  teachers  innovators  police officers and firefighters  so many other positions that we desperately need in our society  so a generation of healthy children raised by strong families is in america's best interest  and i think it's integrally related to our nation's future  the first part of my agenda is to promote paid family leave  which is critical for giving new parents the opportunity to bond with their children at the most important time in their development  parental leave rules may give many families time off  but families of modest means too often simply can't afford to take it unless that leave is paid  i believe we should set a goal of every family in america being able to take time off when their children are born or adopted  and at least some of that time should be paid leave for those who need it  everyone should be able to take the time to start their children off right  no one should miss out on those critical early days  now this is a goal that will take some time to achieve  but what i want to do is propose that we have a family leave initiative with federal government leadership and state level innovation  many states that considered legislation  for example california now guarantees six weeks of family leave that employees paid at   of their wages up to   a week  i will submit   billion per year to an innovation fund that encourages a kind of state level solution  what worked in california may not work in arkansas may not work in new hampshire  we'll offer competitive matching grants that covers startup costs and help pay an equal part of the costs  we're not going to dictate from washington what approach states should take but we will seek out and support the best innovation  i also want to expand the family and medical leave act  it currently only covers firms of fifty or more workers  it has not been an imposition on businesses  all of the nay saying and the sort of chicken little predictions have not come true  i want to lower the threshold to twenty five workers that will include an additional   million americans  i also will reinstate a regulation i fought for during my husband's administration  select states use their unemployment insurance system to provide paid paternity and maternity leave  president bush was wrong to overturn it and we will bring it back  i also want to make the federal government a model workplace by providing paid parental leave  for a relatively modest cost  we can provide that for all federal employees  doing so would set a standard and would make government service more attractive for younger workers  parents also need access to leave at times other than the birth or adoption of a child and we need to recognize that reality  i will also work to promote flexible work scheduling  and guarantee the rights of parents and other caregivers who request a flexible schedule without adverse consequences  now this initiative simply requires employers to consider flexibility seriously  it is not a mandate  all employers can grant such requests  the goal is to shift from a presumption of no flexibility to a presumption of some flexibility with a cooperative approach  united seasons passed a similar law in   which produced a promising result  it was done without a major imposition to business or destruction to the workplace  i believe that we could encourage people to start having these conversations in the workplace  because i think it's important that we look for ways to be more flexible  second i will promote model workplaces in corporate america and reward employers who help their employees balance work and family  we'll establish a public private partnership program on model workplaces at the department of labor and establish awards to highlight businesses that establish such innovative workplace flexibility programs  the partnership will provide grants to businesses to expand models to serve more employees and work to spread the word  we'll also promote the most innovative workplace approaches in areas such as telecommuting  you know reduced work schedules  flexible arrival and departure time  offering on site services such as child care  providing predictable work schedules  offering a cafeteria of many new benefits that different families can choose for themselves  i want to offer telecommuting because it will not only give more flexibility but it will also reduce rush hour hardships  improve the environment  and lower our emissions  this has been one of the principal recommendations  to try to get cars off the road particularly at choke point times  third i will work to ensure better access to high quality child care and to help parents who want to stay at home with their children  i will increase funding to the child care development block grant to get back to providing funding that has been dramatically cut back during the bush administration  we have to improve the quality of child care by helping states improve and enforce licensing and safety standards and there's a lot we can do to get more flexibility in child care  i particularly want to allow eligible stay at home parents to receive child care subsidies through the child care development block grant  currently only parents who place their children in child care are eligible to receive that assistance  that makes no sense to me  why should we pay for other people to care for your children but not give you the support to stay home and do it yourself  by including stay at home parents  we can give families more options and more time together  we'll also begin to find a way therefore to give parents the choice to stay home instead of rushing back to work  and finally  i'll work to protect workers against pregnancy discrimination  i thought we had put this to rest   years ago  but unfortunately we had not  no woman should be fired for being pregnant or giving birth  and no dad should be fired for taking a few days off to help his wife recover from childbirth  or care for their newborn or adopted baby  but today women can be fired just for being pregnant if an employer has a no leave policy  if that sounds horribly outdated  that's because it is  it's time to bring our laws against pregnancy discrimination into this century  that means banning it from out workplaces  which is exactly what i will do as president  now i assume i will have one hundred percent support from the republicans who care deeply about supporting pregnant women and their families and i look forward to having that  inaudible  now will all of this be easy  of course not  but americans who are working hard and taking responsibility deserve the chance to do right for their children and their parents  and this is not expensive  this is totally affordable  everything i propose in this campaign i tell you how i will pay for it  because we're going to get back to fiscal responsibility  but i think we also have to get back to family responsibility  inaudible  you know  when i was a young mother  i was so grateful for the help that i had  you know  my parents would come and stay with us for a couple of weeks at a time or bill who was then governor of arkansas and needed to take a trip  and i wanted to go and they'd come and take care of our daughter  and we had this network of friends and family that was always there for us  in addition to doing what i want to do as president which includes policies that i've outlined  i really want to speak out about how we've got to support young families more in our community  we need to be there for a lot of these young moms like marcy  who are working as hard as they can  and look for ways within our neighborhood or our communities  using institutions like the y to really make a difference  it's not just what our government does  in fact that is probably the least of it  it's how we feel for helping those who are doing the most important job in our society  raising the next generation  so i think we'll have some ideas that people can you know look to take for themselves  such as volunteering at a childcare center  looking for more intergenerational programs  we have found great support of daycare for the elderly mixed with daycare for children  we need to look to see how we support institutions like the y that we all of the nonprofit support that they can get to do these important work that they do every single day  so if we're concerned and i think we should be  that we are putting so much stress on young families  and i believe we're seeing some of that come out in some of the behaviors of our young children  then we each have a stake in trying to be there be part of that village  you know when i wrote that book back in   and   and said it takes a village to raise a child  some people said well that doesn't apply to us  that's an old african proverb  i think it applies to any society  we may be implement it differently  it may not look the same but i think there's more than enough ways we can recognize we're all in this together  i reject the bush administration's attitude that everyone is on his or her own  i don't think that will be a strong society and i know it is not how we build strong family and support for raising up children  so i'm going to be asking all of us to think of ways we can help to make it just a little easier so that our young parents know that the most important job they have is not going to be undermined by the job they have to do to bring home the income that supports them and their family  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", "well  i'll tell you  i know how we're going to solve the energy crisis laughter  we're all going to do it together  this wonderful hall that has meant so much to me over so many years  the site of a lot of great memories for me is a place that i return to with so much love and affection  and standing up here with my   looking out at all of you is just an overwhelming experience  i am so grateful to be here  and i thank maya  ph  and everyone who is working with her here at wellesley  the entire wellesley college students who are putting this team together to support my candidacy and who put this event together today  i also want to thank the students from all of the colleges and universities  i know we have students from b u  and harvard and yale and brown and others   applause    who have traveled to be here  and welcome to wellesley and welcome to this event  it's not exactly a mixer  but i hope you get to meet each other   applause  there are a lot of friends in this audience  people whom i have known for a long time  but there are two that i want to recognize  because they've meant so much  inaudible  that meant two out of four feet had to be on the floor at all times  try it sometime   applause  now  that is a rule that i and many of my classmates became actually nostalgic for when we had college aged children of our own  but while times have clearly changed  what makes this college special has endured  the world class faculty and staff who push you and challenge you  those late nights and long lunches where you challenge each other and learn from each other  the camaraderie that develops when smart  ambitious young women come together in a community of learning  in so many ways  this all women's college prepared me to compete on the all boys' club of presidential politics   applause  this was a place where you could try out all different kinds of leadership styles  where you could ask for critique and support from your friends and the faculty with whom you had an ongoing relationship  it was a place that truly did prepare women to make the best choices that we thought were right for our own lives  i have to tell you  though  when i came to wellesley  i never in a million years could have imagined i would one day return as a candidate for the presidency of the united states  back then  i didn't even know for sure i would return for my sophomore year   laughter  i had grown up in the midwest  outside of chicago   applause  i had serious doubts about this whole going east for college idea and just one month after i moved into my room in stone davis  i felt   applause    i felt like all my worst fears had been confirmed  so many of my classmates had traveled the world  they learned and spoke multiple languages  i was struggling in my classes  in fact  to the point where my french professor said to me   mademoiselle  your talents lie elsewhere   laughter  and i called home  in those days  you called collect  and my parents took the call  which was a good thing  and i said i just didn't think that i could do this  it wasn't for me  now  my father said that was just fine  i think he missed me  but my mother  who never got to go to college  would not hear a word of it  she said   hillary  i don't want you to be a quitter  to which i'm embarrassed to admit i responded   all right  but if i don't like it at the end of the year  can i quit then   laughter  well  i stuck it out and i am so glad i did  because my four years here were among the most exhilarating and informative of my life  and the friends that i made here have been the friends of a lifetime  they have sustained and supported me every step of the way on my journey  as i have tried to do for them  and we started that journey at a tumultuous time in our nation's history  we were embroiled in a war that many of us opposed  here at home  so many of our fellow citizens were marginalized and denied their most basic rights  we were uneasy about our future  uncertain about america's role in the world  and unwilling to trust a government that didn't share our values  sounds kind of familiar  doesn't it   applause  but we were inspired by our wellesley motto not to be ministered onto  but to minister  and we took it to heart  probably more than some of our professors and administrators at the time would have liked  we protested the vietnam war  we marched for civil rights  we fought to bring more minority students and faculty to wellesley  and at the end of our four years  my classmates convinced our skeptical college president  ruth adams  to have the first ever student speaker at graduation and then they convinced me to do the honors   applause  well  when the time came  president adams introduced me as  and i quote   cheerful  good humored  good company  and a good friend to all of us  i'm afraid she probably wanted to take it all back once i opened my mouth   laughter  my thoughts on the indispensable task for criticizing and constructive protest wasn't exactly her idea of a commencement speech  now  when i go back and read it today  i have to admit  it wasn't the world's most coherent address and i sort of cringe when i read that i actually said things like  coming to terms with our humanness and authentic reality and inauthentic reality   laughter  i tell you  wellesley gets into you and   applause  but i still believe as strongly today as i did then in my statement that politics is the art of making what appears to be impossible possible  that is what i have believed ever since i was a student here  that's what i have tried to do throughout my life  starting after law school  as when maya said  i didn't want to go to work for a law firm  i didn't want to clerk for a judge  i went to work instead for the children's defense fund and my first assignment there was trying to figure out what we could do to get more kids into school  i went to new bedford  massachusetts to try to figure out why there were so many children in the census who didn't appear on any school enrollment forms  and i went door to door and in home after home  i found children who were blind or deaf or in wheelchairs  they were kept home because the schools wouldn't or couldn't accommodate them  they wanted to learn  they wanted to succeed  but they never had the chance  i knew then that i wanted to spend my career being a voice for children  children particularly who had been left behind  children who drew the short straw in life  i wanted to fight to give them the same opportunities that i had growing up  and like many of my classmates and many of you  i did want to make a difference  now  that wasn't always easy  back then  women weren't always taken seriously back then  when i was first deciding where to attend law school  i was invited to go  after i had been admitted to harvard and yale  to a cocktail reception for prospective students at the harvard law school and i knew a couple of the male students who were there and they were showing me around  and we ran right into professor paper chase  large  imposing  three piece suit  watch chain  looking down at everyone  and one of my friends said   professor so and so  this is hillary rodham  she's trying to decide between us and our nearest competitor  and he looked down at me and he said   well  first of all  we don't have a nearest competitor   laughter   and  secondly  we don't need any more women  so i decided to go to yale   applause  there were   students  of whom just   were women  and today women are the majority of students in law schools   applause  as a young lawyer  when i once told a colleague that i wanted to practice litigation courtroom law  he replied that this was clearly impossible  because i didn't have a wife  he asked me   laughter  he asked me  totally seriously   when you're in a long trial and you're so busy  who will make sure you have clean socks for court  i had honestly never thought about that   laughter  i had always washed my own socks  and i have been thrilled to see women serving across america not only in the legal profession  but the medical profession  in academia and so much else  but back then  the idea of a woman running for president would have been greeted with derisive laughter  well  times have changed  despite the challenges we faced  we have found ways to serve our country in every way imaginable  in our professions  our communities and our families  and looking at your generation  i see that same desire to give back  we saw it especially after september   while the president didn't ask us to do anything  except go shopping  which hardly ranks up there as a call to action and sacrifice from an american president  the young people of our country had other ideas  between   and   applications to teach for america nearly tripled  between   and   alone  applications to the americorps vista program jumped   percent  and in recent years  the peace corps has seen the highest number of volunteers in three decades  we've seen a resurgence of activism on college campuses  students are brown have created a sustainable foods initiative  organizing farmers' markets and convincing dining halls to switch to local foods  students at keane state college in new hampshire hosted a concert to raise money for victims of the genocide in darfur  students at the university of new hampshire are working to protect our environment by reducing energy and water use on campus  and here at wellesley  just recently  students organized a day of awareness and a rally to protest the unfair treatment of the jena   they've also traveled to new orleans to help rebuild after hurricane katrina and   applause    i especially want to thank you for working together through a group called sisters keepers to help student mothers finish their education   applause  and to those who might sometimes here on television say that your generation is disengaged  that you're not as passionate and committed as we were  i say come to providence  come to keane  come to durham  come to wellesley  travel across our country  take the same opportunity that i've had to actually meet and talk with the young people of america  see how every day you're standing up  taking charge and making the impossible possible  unfortunately  for nearly seven years  we've had a president who hasn't been much of a partner in your work  if anything  he's actually created more work  he's undermined women's right and gay rights and appointed supreme court justices who chipped away at reproductive rights  undermined equal pay  and turned back the clock on school integration  decisions that will affect you and your children for decades to come  he's continued to wage a war in iraq that has taken more than   of our best and most dedicated young men and women and costs us more than   million a day  a bill that  again  you and your children will be paying  unless we reverse course  he's run up our national debt to   trillion  so every baby born today starts life with   of debt on his or her tiny shoulders  a birth tax that will only increase for your children and grandchildren if we don't end this reckless spending  he's waged a war on science  cutting off promising stem cell research  banning his own surgeon general from talking about contraception  failing to address the threat of global warming  that we know not only could  but is leading to increased storms and floods and heat waves and droughts  affecting millions of people across america and the world  to paraphrase one of my most recent opponents  the philosopher  stephen colbert   applause    this administration doesn't make decisions based on facts  it makes facts based on decisions   laughter  as a result  my generation is in danger of being the first ever to leave america worse off than when we found it  and whether you're a democrat or republican  independent  or you don't even care about politics  i think we can all agree that your generation  my daughter's generation deserves better than that  the challenges you face today are no less profound than ones faced by previous generations of americans and you deserve a president who will meet those challenges head on  a president who is committed to your future  a president who will never again play politics with women's health and women's rights  who will never again   applause    who will never again put ideology over science and the cures and breakthroughs of the future  who will never again engage in reckless spending and stick you with the bill  who will confront the challenges that we face without fear or fear mongering and leave america better off  if you give me the chance and the honor  i will be that president for you   applause  i will start by making college affordable again so that middle class and hardworking families can go   applause  back when i went to college  my father told me   here's the deal  got enough money for your tuition and board  but anything beyond that  like buying books  you pay for yourself  and i had worked summers and holidays since i was   so i was fine with that  but when i decided to go to law school and i told my father  he said   well  you're on your own for that one  that wasn't part of the deal  so i kept working and i got a scholarship from wellesley  the vida dutton scudder scholarship  and i borrowed money from the federal government at a low interest rate  i didn't have to worry about some for profit student loan company ripping me and my family off  raising the interest rates or changing the terms of the loan  i didn't get stuck with a massive debt that would have derailed my dreams of a career in public service  when i'm president  i will restore that basic bargain  i proposed a new college tax credit that will cover more than   percent of the typical cost of public colleges and universities or the full cost of tuition for community colleges  and for those who don't go to college  i think we should invest more in apprenticeships and job training and lifelong learning opportunities  there are so many   applause  there's so many hardworking young americans  i think you probably know as many as i do  who don't go to college  but who deserve to have a shot at a high wage  high skill job  and we're going to have a lot of shortages in high skill jobs  so we need to start doing more for them  as well  let's start creating those jobs by investing in a new  clean energy industry and addressing the threat of global warming right now   applause  we all know the science  there's no longer a debate  global warming is real  it's one of the greatest environmental  economic and international security threats we face  and i was  as i'm sure all of you were  so proud of vice president gore when he got the nobel prize for raising the alarm about global warming   applause  but we need a policy and that is what i will do as president  i'll create a   billion green building fund to build and renovate public buildings  we'll make buildings green and energy efficient  i want to establish a strategic energy fund paid for by a   billion investment in clean  renewable technologies by taking away the tax subsidies from the oil companies  they don't need them to make a profit   applause  next week i'll be unveiling a broad agenda to address our energy and global warming challenges and i'll be talking a lot more about those issues all next week  but today's challenges aren't just at home  we have to face those in order to make sure we have a strong and prosperous middle class  that has been the engine of economic growth in our country  that's why we have to tackle energy  that's why we have to make college affordable  that's why we have to have an education system that starts with universal pre kindergarten  that fixes the unfunded mandate of no child left behind   applause  and that's why  finally  we need a health care system that provides quality  affordable health care for every single american   applause  but we know that our challenges are not just here at home  after nearly seven years of a stubborn  preemptive  go it alone foreign policy  we have our work cut out for us to restore our leadership around the world  that starts with bringing our troops home from iraq as responsibly and quickly as we can   applause  there is no military solution and we should not be asking our brave young men and women to serve as referees in their sectarian conflicts  it has to be done as carefully as possible  because it is dangerous withdrawing troops  i've laid out may plans to bring our troops home from iraq and demand that the iraqis take responsibility for their own country  replace our military involvement with an intensive diplomatic initiative in the area  and let me be clear  if george bush doesn't end this war while he is president  when i am president  i will as quickly as i can   applause  but  unfortunately  our problems go far beyond iraq  take out the globe and look at it  we have alienated our friends and emboldened our enemies across the world  i have said i won't even wait until i'm inaugurated  the day after i'm elected  i will ask distinguished americans of both parties to travel around the world with a new message  the era of cowboy diplomacy is over  we're going to start working with people again   applause  and  you know  i have come to a rather obvious conclusion based on my wellesley education  you can't be a leader in the world if no one is following  and we have got to get back to leading  leading with our values  leading with moral authority  leading on behalf of bringing the world together  because when it comes to the challenges we face from global terrorism to global warming to global epidemics and global competition  we cannot do this all on our own  and i want to lead the world to end the genocide in darfur and we need to act immediately  every day we fail to act is a betrayal of our common values  as president  i will speed the deployment of a u n  peacekeeping force  i will provide them with more support to do the job we're asking them to do and create real consequences for anyone who continues the bloodshed or obstructs the peace process  we need to lead the world   applause    to stop the brutal violence in burma and insist that the regime release all political prisoners  including aung san suu kyi   applause  we need to lead the world in fighting the aids epidemic that is creating a global generation of orphans and destabilizing countries  that's why i was proud to sign the pledge to invest   billion by   to combat aids across the world  we need to lead the world   applause  we need to lead the world in standing up for women's rights  twelve years ago  when the u n  convened a historic conference on women in beijing  i was proud to represent our country and proclaim to the world that women's rights are human rights  because when women   applause    when women continue to be raped as a casualty of conflict  trafficked for commercial advantage  denied education and health care and family planning  not given access to credit  denied their rights as citizens  that not only affects them and their countries  that compromises the dignity and the human rights of the entire human family  if we don't stand for women's rights  we will never stand for our best values  that has to be a part of american foreign policy   applause  we need to lead the world in providing opportunity to the world's children  because when   million children in the developing world don't attend school and   million more drop out before finishing first grade  that is a recipe for poverty  extremism and instability  that's why i've introduced the bipartisan education for all act    billion over five years toward the goal of basic education for every boy and girl around the world  and  finally  we need to lead the world by living up to our values here at home  as we seek to promote the rule of law in other nations  we must accept it for ourselves  as we counsel liberty and justice for all  we cannot support torture and the indefinite detention of people we declare to be beyond the law   applause  i realize this is an ambitious agenda  would you expect anything less from a wellesley woman   applause  and i know i can't do it alone  i need your help  i am thrilled that we are launching   student chapters on college campuses across america today  we have a new web site called hillblazers at www hillblazers com to help young people get organized  and in the coming weeks  i need your help to make the calls  to knock on the doors and organize the events and talk to your friends and family  that's what i did back in   when a group of my dear friends and i jumped in a car that one of us finagled to have on campus  and we would drive from wellesley to manchester  new hampshire  stuffing envelopes and walking the precincts for eugene mccarthy  he was running for president on a platform of ending the vietnam war  i am running for president  in part  on a platform to end the war in iraq and most important of all  i need your help on election day  i need you to get the vote out and get your friends registered so they can vote  in   while the voter turnout rate for   to  year olds was higher than in   more than   million still never cast their votes  enough to possibly change the course of history  for so long  young people have been ignored and silenced by others  today  too many young people silence themselves  it's up to all of you to change that  i know that politics can be frustrating  but it seems like we get bogged down in distractions and trivialization  who's up and who's down  people's hairstyle or their laugh or what they're wearing rather than what they're saying  but in those moments when you think you're never going to break through the noise and you just want to give up  i urge you to think about all of the people who came before you  many of them  we'll never know their names  they're lost to history  but so many others  we can read their stories  be amazed at their strength and their courage  think about those audacious women and a few brave men who gathered in seneca falls  new york for the declaration to issue the very first statement ever in the history of the world calling for women's full equality  elizabeth cady stanton  one of the key organizers  was just   years old  one attendee was just   it took more than   years for them to win the vote  more than   years of protesting  organizing  lobbying  going to jail  doing hunger strikes  chaining themselves to the gate in front of the white house  but they never gave up  and just one woman from the seneca falls convention lived long enough to actually cast a ballot  think about the civil rights movement  dr  martin luther king  jr  was just   years old when he led the montgomery bus boycott  my dear friend  congressman john lewis  was just   when he led that historic march across the bridge in selma  a march that ended with teargas  hoses and the crack of night sticks against and his and others' skulls  as the marchers knelt down to pray  think about that  they were attacked as they knelt down to pray  they were  as congressman lewis put it later  using our bodies as a witness to the truth and they forced america to bear witness  as well  they were willing to put their lives on the line and together they made the impossible possible  i stand here today because of those brave men and women and i am inspired every day by the people i meet on the campaign trial  you know  the mothers and fathers who lift their little girls on their shoulders or lean over and whisper in their ears   see  honey  in america  you can be anything you want to be  the women in their  s who come to my events  they stand there  they hold themselves up in a walker  they may be in a wheelchair  and as i meet them  they tell me   i was born before women could vote and i want to live long enough to see a woman in the white house  i know the challenges   applause  i know the challenges we face are daunting  but i still believe what i said in my commencement speech nearly   years ago  fear is always with us  but we just don't have time for it  not now  so let's roll up our sleeves and get to work together  we're ready to shatter that highest glass ceiling  it's what americans have been doing for more than   years  it's what i believe has created the space for the transformative changes that we have been the beneficiaries of  i think we're ready for that kind of change again  change is just a word if you don't have the strength and experience to make it happen  i believe i do and i believe together we can make it  we can make history  i like to think that it will be young people driven by dr  king's fierce urgency of now who will make the difference in this election  because when i am president  my presidency is about your future  it is about what you will have to make your lives  to make your choices however you choose  to be responsible for yourselves  those whom you love  your communities  our country and the world  there's a lot of work to do and i hope you will join me in doing that work  thank you all very  very much   applause "], ["clinton", "i am thrilled to be here and i have to say having the endorsement of this extraordinary senator  leader  champion   means the world to me  lou  i am thrilled to have you on this team  it's a winning team and we're going to go together to the white house and get the changes that america needs  i am very happy to be here  i want to thank clyde terry  the executive director  who in his remarks pointed out something that all of you know so well  that he was one of the driving forces to help form the granite state independent living organization  and i salute him for that  and you've been blessed with good leadership to keep it going and keep it growing  clyde thank you  thank you for your efforts  it's also wonderful to be here with ted kennedy  jr  he is a great leader in the tradition that we would expect  and i'm going to proudly tell his father  when i see senator kennedy  that i was with his son and his son is much better looking  it is great to being here with all of you  i want to make a few remarks and then i know you've got some questions  it is really important that you're holding this forum  the manchester community television is covering it and you've got more than   national disability rights organizations that have come together to host this  i've already seen friends from new york and washington  dc who are here today  well you are doing are doing what has to be done  and that is standing up and fighting for the rights of people with disabilities  my friend and supporter  senator maggie hassan  was just telling me   she said you know  it's a lot easier to be kind than to be just  and we want both  we want both kindness and justice for people with disabilities  disability rights are civil rights   the right to be treated equally  they are human rights   the right of all people to fulfill their god given potentials  and they are an urgent issue for america   because america will never achieve our potential until all americans can achieve theirs  now obviously we have come a long way in this country  but  we have our work cut out for us if we're going to keep the promise that we should   that we will continue to work for a more perfect union that includes americas  for the past seven years  it's as though people with disabilities have been invisible to this president and his administration  if you're a child who can't get the special education classes you need   you're invisible  if you're a citizen who wants to vote  but the polling place doesn't have the right equipment or the right help   you're invisible  if you're a worker wants a job  but can't find one that accommodates your disability   you're invisible too  well  people with disabilities may be invisible to george bush  but they are not invisible to you  and they will never be invisible to me  this is a cause i've been involved with for throughout my   years  my first job out of law school was with the children's defense fund  i did not want to go to work for big law firm  i didn't want to work for federal judge  i wanted to work on behalf of children  i was assigned to go to new bedford  massachusetts as part of a nationwide effort to understand why so many children were not enrolling in school  and how did we know that  because we had census figures of how many children there were in a community between the ages of five and   and we had school enrollment figures  and they didn't match  where were those children  knocking on those doors was eye opening and heart breaking experience  i found children who weren't in school because of physical disabilities like blindness and deafness  on the small back porch off her family's home  i met a girl in a wheelchair who told me how much she wanted to go to school  but she knew she couldn't go  simply because she couldn't walk  these children were kept home because the schools couldn't  and wouldn't  accommodate them  they wanted to learn  they wanted to succeed  but they never had the chance  i knew then that i wanted to spend my life fighting to be a voice for children who had been left out and left behind  i wanted to give them the same opportunities i had growing up  the children's defense fund submitted our results to the congress  and  with the help of strong leaders like senator kennedy  and all of you who are advocates  it led to the individuals with disabilities education act   mandating that children with physical  emotional and learning disabilities be educated in the public school system  my work on this issue came full circle  when as a senator  when i helped write the idea reauthorization act in   to ensure we have targeted resources dedicated to teacher training  in the senate  i have also worked to pass the community choice act  which will finally  we hope  eliminate the institutional bias in our medicare and medicaid systems  i have aggressively fought to investigate the linkages between environmental toxins and disabilities  and i have strongly supported the ada restoration act  and look forward to signing it into law as president   and you're all invited to the signing ceremony when i am president  my white house will welcome you  our government will be a partner with you  and new opportunities will be open to you  i have laid out an agenda to increase employment among people with disabilities  these reforms are long overdue  americans with disabilities have half the employment rate and double the poverty rate of those without disabilities  even those who have graduated from college work at only two thirds the rate of others  we need to provide more opportunities for people with disabilities to break into the middle class   not just to survive  but to thrive  one of my first acts will be to reinstate my husband's executive order that committed the federal government to hiring   people with disabilities  president bush was wrong to abandon that commitment  and i'm going to get us back on track  i'll also double our investment in work enabling technologies  by providing more low interest loans for purchasing them  i'll provide real time support for employers so they can make the accommodations necessary for their employees to do their jobs  i want to also propose  and work to pass  a   per worker tax credit to offset the expenses of work and transportation for workers with disabilities  in addition to the positive agenda that i will pursue  i want to get rid of the disincentives for work in so many federal programs  right now  people with disabilities can lose their social security disability insurance  their supplemental security income  their medicare  and medicaid benefits when they earn even a tiny salary  that is absolutely upside down  so just think about it  it makes no sense  even if you can work and want to work  there's a penalty if you try to work  we are a nation that believes in work and we want people to make a contribution  we believe it's in the individual's interest  as well as the country's  that's bad for taxpayers  it's unfair to people with disabilities  and we need to end it once and for all  one of the proudest accomplishments of the clinton administration was to sign the ticket to work and work and the work incentives improvement act into law  as a result    states have enacted policies to reduce the disincentives to work  that's significant progress  but state policies are still uneven  that's why we need to move at the federal level  as president  i'll help working individuals with disabilities buy in to medicaid  eliminate the medicare eligibility time limit on the number of years an individual can work  and conduct a review to determine where disincentives to work still exist in federal benefit programs and where we can and must do better  i think we can break down these barriers to employment and empower people with disabilities to find the jobs and careers that are fulfilling and important to them and the rest of us  finally  i want to mention my health care plan  it's called the american health choices plan and it has real significance for people with disabilities  my health care plan will let you keep your existing coverage if you are satisfied with it  but it provides affordable choices if you don't have coverage or you are dissatisfied  and it covers every single american  everyone will have access to the same choices members of congress have now  we have a congressional plan that covers members of congress and federal employees  it works pretty well and you pay for it  it provides more than   options and it has a lower cost than you'll find through most employers and certainly on your own in the marketplace  i believe if it's good enough for members of congress  it's good enough for you and every other american  and under my plan  you will never be denied coverage because of pre existing conditions or risk factors  right now  health insurance companies spend   billion a year trying to figure out how not to cover people  i mean that's their business model  they claim they're in the health insurance business  but they're really in the health no insurance business  they're trying to avoid covering people  and then if they some how get caught  and they actually cover you  they try to avoid paying for the services that you receive  i think that's wrong  and i'm offering a new business plan  and in fact  i'm going to save them a fortune  because here's the new policy  more discrimination  period  cover everybody  my plan requires insurance companies to compete based on cost and quality  not how skillfully they can exclude patients with the greatest medical needs  we're also going to start covering prevention  i believe we can actually avoid some disabilities if we provide prevention  the clearest example of that is that government and health insurance plans  rarely pay for a visit to a podiatrist for a diabetic  but they pay for the amputation of the foot  therefore we have a created a disability instead of preventing a disability  and there are many other examples that i could through in the absolutely backwards way that the health care system currently operates  my health plan  my disabilities agenda  and all of the policies i've put forward have one unifying principle  that we're all in this together and it's time to start acting like it again  i do not believe in the bush republican policies of you're in this on your own  they call it the ownership society  and they are trying to put the entire burden of coping with all of life's unpredictable events on the individual  that was what was behind their attempt to privatize social security  that is what is behind their efforts to cut back on support from other systems that enable people to fulfill their god given potential  well i believe that whenever anyone in america can't live up to his or her potential that diminishes all of us  and we owe all of our people wise  sensible policies that recognize the dignity  the value  and the humanity of their all americans  i know that's what most americans believe  we just need our political system once again to show the leadership necessary to make it happen  i am excited by my campaign because of the broad support i am receiving across new hampshire  but i know we have a very tough two months plus to go  and i'm going to do everything i can to travel this state to meet with as many citizens as possible to answer your questions  but one thing i that am proud to be representing is the change that americans deserve to have  now change is just a word unless you have the strength and experience to make it happen  but i don't any people who are stronger  than people with disabilities  who get up every single day and do the best they can  reach out to others  and i want to recognize that strength  so  yes  kindness is called for from all of us to one another  i believe that we've got to get back to treating each other with that sense of recognition and respect  but never forget that justice is at the core of the american dream  and we must once again stand for just here at home and around the world  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", "thank you all so much  thank you senator hogg  thank you all for being here  this is such an exciting day because we are in this facility being part of the future that we will make together for our country  i want to thank senator hogg because he has campaigned on climate change  he has campaigned on renewable energy  he's campaigned on the future we need for our children and i'm thrilled to have so many others here with me today  i want to thank county supervisor jim houser  i want to thank justin shields from the hawkeye labor council  i want to thank state representative swati dandekar  i want to thank state representative todd taylor  i want to thank my dear friend christie vilsack who's with me and i want to especially thank clipper windpower because other people are talking and you're doing  you're making it happen   applause  i have been looking forward to being here because i know how important it is that those of us who are running for president  asking the good people of iowa for your support  that we tell you what we will do when we're president to deal with the big problems facing america  and today i want to focus on energy and climate change  two years ago as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation  i traveled to barrow  alaska  that's the northern most point of the united states  and i also traveled through on my way there the yukon territory in canada  traveling over those vast coniferous forests that blanket those harsh unforgiving latitudes  i looked down to see dead trees as far as the eye could reach  these trees are part of an ecosystem formed to survive brutal conditions  but the giant spruce trees of the yukon  some centuries old  are no match for a relative newcomer  a tiny insect known as the bark beetle  the forests  it turns out  were once protected by cold  cold winters  the beetle could not survive  but warmer temperatures have allowed this invasive species to travel into higher latitudes and wreak unnatural havoc  in once pristine forests  there was devastation  millions of acres infested  whole swaths of land   once green   now brown  when we arrived in barrow  virtually everyone i spoke to had a personal wake up call about what was happening in the climate  a visit to a boyhood watering hole revealed a dried up lakebed  a native village uprooted by erosion  i met lifelong participants in dogsled races who told me they no longer even needed to wear gloves during those races  at the top of the world  you hear stories   affirmed by decades of scientific investigation   of changing weather patterns  melting ice  retreating glaciers  unprecedented wildfires  eroding coasts  and invasive species  you can see the evidence with your own eyes  there are no climate change skeptics inside the arctic circle  of course  this is a story about a place thousands of miles from here  in one of the most remote regions of our planet  but i share it because it is not an isolated experience any longer  it is a part of our story  it is part of iowa's story and america's story  alarming climate changes  a stagnant economy  our health weakened  our national security compromised   because of our failure to move to a clean  efficient energy future  it is our story because the climate crisis portends drastic changes to our way of life  the last two decades of the  th century were the hottest in   years  the intergovernmental panel on climate change found that   of the past   years are among the warmest since   rising sea levels along the coastal united states could cost   billion in the coming decades  beyond our shores  you have african countries experiencing water stress  asian countries contending with increasing flooding  it's our story because our dependence on foreign oil threatens our economy  america's national and economic security has taken a backseat to the driver's seat  gas prices have doubled over the past six years  nationwide  diesel recently hit an all time high  you know gasoline prices  depending upon where you shop  are around   a gallon  two thirds of americans now say that rising gas prices are a hardship for their families  one in four low income families have already missed a mortgage or a rent payment because of rising energy costs  meanwhile  we are more dependent on foreign oil today than we were on   and one third of our trade deficit is the petroleum we import  as we transfer massive amounts of wealth to undemocratic governments that use those funds to stifle opposition and finance extremism  it's our story because the carbon economy compromises our health  the air we breathe  and the environment in which we raise our children  one study found that pollution from power plants causes   premature deaths in our country each year  nearly a third of our childhood asthma cases are caused by air pollution and environmental contamination  and finally  it's our story because the president has systematically undermined our path to a clean energy future  instead of recognizing the irrefutable evidence  this administration has launched a war on science itself  political appointees have censored studies on global warming  silenced climate experts  according to a survey by the union of concerned scientists  nearly three fourths of climate experts witnessed inappropriate interference in climate research  and just this past march  the administration issued a gag order to employees of the fish and wildlife service forbidding them to speak about the plight of polar bears without prior official approval  instead of an all out optimistic assault on the problem  the bush administration launched an assault on the problem solvers  the president took seven years to recognize climate change  he refused really to engage in talks with other global leaders at the united nations and even tried to stop individual states from taking their own action to reduce co  emissions under the clean air act  this is the biggest challenge we have faced in a generation  it is a challenge to our economy  to our security  to our health  and to our planet  and it's time for america to meet it  it is time to get back into the solutions business  and that is what america does better than anybody else   applause  you know  when america confronted a great depression  we did not wring our hands  we rolled up our sleeves  try rolling up your sleeves while you're wringing your hands  it can't be done  and we created the new deal and invented social security  when the greatest generation was called upon to save the world from tyranny in world war ii  our whole country responded  while young men fought overseas  americans did their part to support the war effort here at home  when the soviet union launched sputnik  we didn't minimize the challenge or silence the scientists who wanted to get out and meet it  instead  within one year  president eisenhower had created the defense advanced research projects agency  created nasa  and passed the national defense education act that fostered the next generation of scientists and engineers  our nation was so united and determined that we answered president kennedy's call to land an american on the moon and return him safely to earth within the decade  for this generation of americans  climate change is our space race  it is our home front mobilization during world war ii and it is our response to the great depression  according to studies  the negative economic consequences of climate change will affect every part of our country  virtually every sector of our economy  and strain our local governments  cost jobs  and extract a horrific human toll  i'm very proud that vice president gore and the intergovernmental panel on climate change just won the nobel peace prize for sounding the alarm that all of us must respond to   applause  there are also security implications  a group of retired   and  star generals and admirals issued a recent report describing in detail the threat that global warming poses to our national security  from increased conflict over natural resources to instability and migrations  earlier this year  the senate passed my legislation to require the department of defense to integrate this issue into our planning  and for those who still believe that we can't afford to tackle climate change  the price of inaction is far higher than the price of action  i believe america is ready to take action  to break the bonds of the old energy economy  to prove that the climate crisis is one of the great economic opportunities in the history of our country  seizing it will unleash a wave of innovation  create millions of new jobs  enhance our security  and lead the world in a revolution in how we produce and use energy  it can literally be a new beginning for the  st century   applause  after   years of advocacy on behalf of children and families  i believe solving the climate and energy crisis is critical to leaving our children a world as healthy and welcoming as the one we inherited   applause  after eight years in the white house and seven years in the senate  i believe i know how to get the job done  i know that a true american response offers us a way not just to bridge the economic divide  but to heal the partisan divide that has paralyzed our politics and compromised our future  there is something for everyone to do  and success will require each of us do our part  so  if you're ready for change  i am ready to lead   applause  when i am president  we will set three major energy goals for america  one  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions   percent from   levels by   the amount necessary to avoid the most dangerous and destructive consequences of climate change   applause  two  to cut foreign oil imports by two thirds from projected levels by   to move america toward energy independence  and three  to move us from a carbon based economy to an efficient  green economy by unleashing a wave of private sector innovation in clean energy and energy efficiency  i believe that will create at least five million good new jobs from clean energy over the next decade   applause  now  how will we achieve these goals  well  first  as president  i will lead a national commitment to energy efficiency  this is the cheapest  cleanest  fastest way to reduce energy consumption and save energy costs  and to create good new jobs that cannot be outsourced  the department of energy estimates that we can reduce energy use in residential buildings   by   we can do better than that i believe  by some estimates all the future growth in energy demand in north america  all of it  could be met through investments in efficiency alone  and we know how to do this  since   three fourths of all new demand has been met simply by using energy more efficiently  over the past three decades  california has held its electricity use per person flat  in other words  there's been no increase in electricity use per person in the entire state of california for   years  they've done it through practical steps in conservation and efficiency  during the same   year period  energy demand in the rest of country  skyrocketed by   california's flat  we've all gone up   now  did california get left behind  did people flee california because it was no longer a good place to live  just the opposite  it has prospered  a study released earlier this year by the university of california berkeley found that cutting greenhouse gas emissions to   levels by   through further improvements in efficiency  could create more than   million new jobs in california alone  and if american electricity use had fallen at the same rate as california use  our whole country would be using   less electricity today  so when i'm president  increasing energy efficiency quickly will be priority one  we will set a goal of reducing electricity demands   by   we must change the way utilities make money  today the incentives are backwards  the less we conserve  the more carbon we emit  the more money utilities earn  we'll change that with energy efficiency targets for utilities and incentives for saving power instead of generating more of it  this seemingly simple change  called decoupling  has transformational potential because utilities are in the best position to help businesses and families make investments in efficiency  fourteen states already have some form of efficiency goals for utilities and more utilities are embracing that as well  decoupling permits a utility to invest in efficiency  duke power and other utilities have committed to go beyond that  they are offering energy audits to all of their customers  they're helping their customers come up with plans to cut consumption and to finance the implementation over   to   years  as if efficiency gains were mini power plants  it works like this  the installation of solar power and cold resistant glass and other improvements cut your utility bill   the utility pays the upfront cost of those improvements and then a portion of the efficiency savings goes to you to cut your bills  and the other goes to the utilities to pay off the cost of the improvement  you get a lower utility bill  they get more power with no more co  emissions  in the process a lot of jobs are created   installing the new product  manufacturing  distributing and selling  the system is user friendly  faster  cheaper and more labor intensive than building a new power plant  a lot of people who build things for a living  say 'well  but if we don't keep building power plants  we're going to lose jobs ' it's just the contrary  if we're building millions of mini power plants we're going to create more jobs  that's what i want to see for us  once we have nationwide decoupling  every utility should implement this type of system and maximize efficiency before building any new power plants  and that's just the beginning  at your office  you probably have a desktop computer  a thousand times more powerful and half the price than computers available   years ago  an i pod can hold more songs than you can listen to in a month  we can talk to anyone  anywhere  at any time using  st century information technology  which has transformed our economy  but all of this depends on a power grid all but unchanged in half a century  it is time to start building a  st century grid  right now the system runs on auto pilot  the only connection between your home and the grid is the power you draw  but what if we harnessed all of the advances in information technology  imagine if you could time your air conditioner  or your dishwasher or you dryer to turn on when demand for power was less and the cost lower  imagine if you could charge your car in your garage at night  and sell power back to the utility when your car is parked at work during the hours of peak energy demand  imagine if you could sell back the excess power you generate with solar panels on your roof  imagine if the system could manage the stresses on the grid continuously  cutting peak demand to avoid brown outs  conserve power and save money  just a   drop in peak demand would save   billion in energy costs over   years  we can harness this technology  as president i will fund ten  smart grid cities  provide smart grid tax incentives to utilities and encourage state utility commissions to provide incentives as well  we will also make appliances more efficient  saving consumers   billion between now and   you know the epa's successful energy star program provides valuable information to consumers about how to save energy and save money by purchasing more efficient products  let's take it further and create a climate star initiative  to provide consumers with information to compare the carbon footprints of products that they buy  we will also phase out the incandescent light bulb   the technology that thomas edison pioneered  i think thomas edison would support this idea  in fact  he'd probably be there helping us develop the replacements   from l e d s to compact fluorescents  compact florescent bulbs   they may look funny   they use a quarter the amount of energy and last   to   times longer than the typical incandescent bulb  if we move to compact fluorescent  or other equally energy saving alternatives  we will cut our national electric bill by more than   billion over just   years  i also want to launch a green building fund to invest   billion per year into energy efficiency in public buildings like schools  police stations  firehouses  and offices  we'll help   million low income families modernize their homes to be more energy efficient  buildings account for   of america's carbon emissions   and there are so many simple  cost effective steps we can take to reduce heating bills  light bills  save taxpayers' money  and cut pollution  in the process we can create hundreds of thousands of new jobs  i will also create a program called  connie mae  that stands for the carbon neutral mortgage association  this is a great idea that vice president gore has championed  the extra cost of thicker insulation and efficient window coatings  for example  are often shunned by builders and buyers looking to save money   even though these green products actually pay for themselves in lower utility bills  connie mae will make it easier for families to secure affordable loans from private lenders to improve the efficiency in their own home  it's a win for the bankers  homebuyers and the planet  yesterday night i was at the great river medical center  it's in west burlington  and i learned it is the most energy efficient hospital in america  this is happening in iowa right now  it's just happening so rarely and on such an individual basis that we don't realize all of the benefits that we can get  the great river medical center is powered by the world's largest lake coupled geothermal heating and cooling system  i thought that was pretty neat  right here in iowa  the most energy efficient hospital in america   applause  the second piece of my agenda asks the national government to set the rules and lead the way  as president  i will put in place a market based cap and trade system to reduce carbon pollution  here's how it will work  the federal government auctions permits for   of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions  companies purchase those allowances but they can be traded  borrowed  banked  bought  and sold  the market will determine the cost of carbon pollution and companies will be rewarded for cutting emissions  in combination with efficiency  fuel economy standards and other proposals  this system will ensure we meet our goal of reducing our contribution to global warming below   levels by   we know this can work  it was exactly what we did in the  s to reduce acid rain  cutting sulfur dioxide emissions by   million tons below   levels  while setting down the rules  the federal government will also set an example  all new federal buildings designed after noon january     when i become president  will have to be carbon neutral   that is zero emissions  no new federal buildings that don't meet that standard   applause  i will ask the department of housing and urban development to strengthen energy efficiency standards for public housing and develop model standards for all new construction  and we will make energy efficiency a core mission for the government services administration  which manages federal buildings  i also want to help local governments go green  more than   mayors have signed a pledge to cut their city's contribution to climate change and meet the standards set by the kyoto protocol  third  i will ask automakers to play a role  today  your car may have a cd player  a navigation system and gps  we have front and side impact airbags  anti lock brakes  technology that senses tiny changes in road conditions  henry ford would be dumbfounded until he opened the hood  because he would recognize the internal combustion engine underneath  it is the same basic concept that he put in to the model t almost a century ago  in fact  that model t got better gas mileage than your typical suv does today  we can't continue this  it's time for a change  for two decades  u s  fuel economy has stagnated  cars and light trucks account for  of the   million barrels of oil consumed every day in america  i believe america should do what we do best  lead the innovation race  imagine if over the past century  we'd advanced as far in powering our cars as we have in keeping our cars safe  as president  i will raise the fuel efficiency standards to   miles per gallon by   and   by    applause  that will save consumers more than   billion dollars in fuel bills each year and save us   million barrels of oil each day  but i'm not going to ask the auto companies to do it alone  i want to be a partner  a good partner  to help them transition to a clean energy future  i'll provide   billion in  green vehicle bonds  to help domestic automakers retool their older plants to manufacture new  more efficient cars and trucks  we've also got to invest more in new batteries  transmissions and other technologies  i will create a tax credit to help auto makers cover the legacy health care and retirement costs they face  next  we'll accelerate the production of plug in hybrids  these are vehicles that can be filled up at the gas station and charged up in a standard outlet  a vehicle powered by electricity releases one third less global warming pollution  even if the electricity comes from coal  these cars can offer the promise of   miles to the gallon  and if the plug in is a flex fuel vehicle running on e  ethanol  it could potentially travel   miles for every gallon of gas consumed   applause  now  the good news is  detroit is already embracing this existing technology  it is poised to be a world leader  general motors plans to bring a plug in hybrid to market in   and ford is looking at plug ins as well  but the plug in revolution can't happen fast enough  as president  i will invest   billion in research and development to reduce the cost  improve the capacity and the lifespan of lithium ion batteries  i will offer consumers a tax credit of up to   for purchasing a plug in hybrid  and i want to add   plug in hybrids to the federal fleet by   at the same time  we've got to increase access to public transportation  for every mile you travel on a subway  a bus or a train instead of in a car  you produce   less carbon monoxide and half as much carbon dioxide  if we have clean buses  more efficient locomotives  the reductions could even be greater  i want to increase funding for public transit by more than   billion each year and link that to smart policies that discourage sprawl and congestion  fourth  we'll ask the oil companies to do their part  i have proposed a   billion strategic energy fund to invest in the clean energy technologies of the future  here's how we'll pay for it   by ending the tax breaks that oil companies receive to maintain the existing oil dependence economy   applause  oil is now over   a barrel  a lot of folks think it's going to get to over   a barrel  the oil companies don't need your tax dollars to help them  we're going to give these companies that have made the highest profits in the history of the world a choice  pay into the strategic energy fund or invest more in renewable energy  we cannot let the middle class pay twice to solve the energy crisis  in higher prices at the pump and in bearing the largest burden of transitioning to a green economy  a portion of the oil companies' profits should also be used to spark the r amp d  that will help america the world's leader in exporting that technology  i will also require oil companies and other major gasoline retailers to install e  pumps at half of their stations in the next five years and all of their stations in ten  it's time for the oil companies to become energy companies  that's good for our country and they must begin to do it  fifth  we will support the innovative companies  the skilled workers  the creative entrepreneurs and the path breaking researchers who are driving the next great discovery  germany  japan and other countries have surpassed us in the production of solar  wind  geothermal and other vital technologies  we've always been the innovation nation  and it's time for us to lead again  tomorrow  i will be in newton outlining my energy jobs agenda  but we need look no further than clipper windpower   applause  in a few short years  clipper windpower has set an example of how creating clean energy can create good jobs  this is a   square foot facility  you employ more than   people helping to develop and deploy the next generation of wind technology  just one of the turbines that will be fueled by these great generators  which is really the brain of the windpower  can power   homes without producing any pollution at all   applause  as president  i will be a good partner for clipper and for other companies and innovators who are not only contributing to their bottom line and creating jobs  but i think being real patriots  this is the new challenge  what does it mean to be a patriot for america in the  st century  end our dependence on foreign oil and an old energy system that undermines our growth and our future   applause  i will also increase the goal for biofuels to   billion gallons by   with almost half of that coming from advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol  we will accelerate the production of advanced coal technology  coal currently provides  of our electricity in america  but it comes at a high price in greenhouse gases and other pollutants  we need to accelerate the development and deployment of technology that can safely capture and store carbon dioxide emissions  that is why i will provide funding immediately for   large scale projects  at the same time  we need to stop building coal plants the way we have in the past  i will require utility commissions to evaluate whether the energy efficiencies that decoupling makes possible can meet expected demand before permitting any new coal plant  in any event  i will require all new coal plants to be built so that capture and storage technology can be added as soon as it is available  i will strongly support a renewable portfolio standard  with   of electricity coming from wind  solar  and other renewable sources by    applause  we have lost so much time in the last years  today america produces between   and   of our power through renewable sources  meanwhile  denmark plans to meet one half of its energy needs with wind by   last year  germany produced half of the world's solar electricity  while these countries provide incentives for energy independence  their companies are exporting new technologies around the world  boosting their economies and creating new jobs  in just the last two years  the german economy added   new jobs in renewable energy  as a point of comparison  since we have almost four times the population they have  they have   million  we have a little over   million  we could have added some   good jobs from the same sources if we had been leading the way instead of dragging our feet  and clean energy will also improve both the health of our families  asthma rates are soaring in part because of the way we produce energy  no one  can any longer  ignore the health affects of dirty energy  the international olympic committee is considering canceling some events at the   olympics in beijing due to poor air quality  so china is now rushing to institute tougher emissions standards to clean up the air before the games begin  as president  to help us reach   by   i will make the production tax credit for wind and solar permanent  no more guessing what you're going to get as you move forward with your production   applause  i will also provide tax incentives for homes and businesses to install technologies  and establish a national net metering standard   so  families and companies that install these new technologies can sell power back to the grid for a fair price all over the country  that happens in some states  but it stops at the border  we need to make it national  finally  the strategic energy fund i've proposed will double investment in energy research and invest in a new initiative called the energy advanced research projects agency  i want to bring together the best minds in the public and private  and academic sectors to think outside the box  if we have the best minds thinking about an alternative to the internal combustion engine  who knows what we would create  we need to be doing this  the agency that helped us win the space race  that literally creating the internet  can be the way we deal with our new energy challenges  america can lead the world's green revolution  our entrepreneurial capacity  our capital markets  our research institutions and our skilled workforce are unmatched  we are the best in the world  let's start acting like we're the best again   applause  this will create at least   million jobs  you've heard of white collar jobs  you've heard of blue collar jobs  these will be new  green collar  jobs all across america   applause  think about it  entry level jobs insulating houses and installing green roofs on buildings  high wage construction jobs modernizing our grid and building green buildings  farm jobs planting and harvesting bio energy crops  high tech bioengineering jobs in cellulosic ethanol  management jobs in new  clean energy companies  high tech jobs developing new  affordable forms of clean energy  and last but not least  manufacturing jobs building wind turbines  solar panels and other products  just like here at clipper   applause  sixth  shaping our own clean energy future will enable america to play an indispensable role in shaping the world's clean energy future  we can't meet these challenges alone  we could be as clean as all of us hope to be in       years  if other countries like china and india are polluting the atmosphere  all of their pollution will get up in the wind currents and fall right down on us  we can't just act like the world doesn't need our leadership the way we have for the last   and half years  other countries like china and india  they see we've done nothing  they feel free  therefore  to do very little  that is not the way we can lead  we have to prove that moving away from a carbon economy is good for growth and lead the world to a new binding agreement to reduce emissions dramatically  the president's failed unilateral energy policy is a part of our failed unilateral foreign policy  it's deprived us of the credibility and the leverage we need to solve the climate crisis  i'll change that by leading the process to develop a new treaty to replace the kyoto protocol  which is set to expire in   one of the worst messages the president sent was when he took office and rejected completely kyoto  he could have said we don't like kyoto but we're immediately starting a new process  but that didn't happen  well  come january   i'm sending a different message  i want to act quickly to help develop a new treaty  i will engage in high level meetings with leaders around the world every three months  if that's what it takes to hammer out a new agreement  my goal will be to secure a deal by   we can't wait for two more years  i will establish an e  that's modeled on the g  which is where the big industrial economies come together  we need the world's major carbon emitting nations to come together to tackle these challenges  i want to focus on international attention to solve the problem of global deforestation  we're losing our forests dramatically  they play such an important role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and we need to figure out how to have a win win strategy for that  we've seen how good leadership can make a difference in solving global climate and environmental problems  former prime minister margaret thatcher understood the urgency of ozone depletion  called a meeting in london and was a driving force in banning ozone depleting chemicals worldwide  seventh  every single american will have a role to play  everywhere i go  i meet people  and particularly young people and children  who ask me what they can do to fight global warming  what they can do to be more energy independent  now  i always tell them about my late father who turned off every light before he left any room and he used to turn off the thermostat when we went to bed at night  as he used to say  'i'm not paying to heat the house  so get more covers ' that sounds kind of funny  but that's what our parents and our grandparents used to do  we've got to be more conscious of how we live today  on wednesday  i will outline in greater detail the ways individuals  communities  colleges  schools  all of us can play our role  it starts by asking every american who wishes to sign a pledge to do so to reduce your personal contribution to global warming   encourage your neighbors to do the same  if every home replaced   this is astonishing and i kept saying are you sure this is true  listen to this   if every single one of our homes replaced just one  watt incandescent light bulb with one compact fluorescent  it would save enough energy to light more than   million homes and prevent the greenhouse gas emissions equal to the amount produced by   cars in a year  so when people say well we've got to wait for the government  we got to wait for great companies like clipper  that's not true  there's something every one of us can do  i'm going to challenge individuals and businesses to set their own energy saving goals  i'm going to challenge schools  colleges  and universities and students to do the same  and give awards so we can really hold up the best leaders  i'm going to challenge communities to do the same as well  we're going to invest in new management tools so that cities and communities can keep track of what they emit and when i'm president  the united states treasury will issue  energy independence bonds  dedicated to the strategic energy fund  during world war ii  americans purchased more than   billion worth of war bonds  more than   million americans volunteered to participate in bond drives  i have no doubt that we can appeal to that same sense of duty and patriotism today  as vice president gore says  political will is a renewable resource  eighth and lastly  i am outlining more than a plan  i have a strategy to make this real  i have tried throughout this campaign not to just to make speeches about what i want to do  but to tell you how i will pay for it and how i will do it  one of the biggest problems facing those countries that did sign the kyoto protocol was turning good intentions into actual  economically beneficial results  as president  i will create a national energy council  modeled on the national economic council and the national security council  to bring together all the relevant players in the federal government to ensure that we all have the same priorities and we follow a rigorous implementation plan  for example  the energy department will work more closely with the education department on good models for school construction  the transportation department will work more closely with the epa on highway congestion  the council will be led by a national energy adviser with a direct line to the president to coordinate our government wide efforts and maintain accountability  i will also reform the department of energy  this energy today is focused primarily on carbon based fuels and nuclear power  with much less attention to renewables like wind  i will focus the mission of the department of energy on moving us toward energy independence  with a new approach to solar and wind and biofuels and hydropower and geothermal and other renewables  this is a transformational challenge for our nation and our government  i will start meeting it on day one  in one of america's darkest hours   soon after the attack on pearl harbor  long before victory was assured   president roosevelt addressed the nation in one of his fireside chats  the president did not mince words  he spoke honestly and in great detail about the scale and scope of the threats we faced  he even asked americans to take out a map of the world so they could follow along what he was talking about  the president said  'the task that we americans now face will test us to the uttermost  never before have we been called upon for such a prodigious effort  never before have we had so little time in which to do so much ' americans were up to that task  while young brave troops served  and bled and died overseas  here at home americans did their part  men and women went to work in factories to build ships and planes  americans grew victory gardens  purchased war bonds and conserved fuel and electricity  the task before us commands the same urgency and demands the same resolve  tackling the energy crisis is the calling of our time  and when i am president  it will be the calling of our nation  and it will involve all of us  and just as the greatest generation rose to the occasion  i believe the greenest generation will do the same   applause  in my campaign  i have defined the four big goals for our country  restore our leadership in the world  rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class  reform our government and reclaim the future for our children  meeting the energy and climate change challenge is essential to reaching every one of those  i do not want to be part of the first generation to leave america and the world in worse shape than when we found them  it will not happen on my watch   applause  if you want america to be in the solutions business again  if you want to end the destructive partisanship  if you want to bring people together   join with me in embracing one of the greatest challenges we've ever faced  it will be an exciting  noble  and rewarding adventure  taking us to places we can't even imagine today  just like those clipper ships opened up the world to america  we're going open up the future to our children and grandchildren  and if we do it right they will look back with pride on this moment when americans came together to turn a threat to our future into the triumph of this new century   applause  thank you and god bless you "], ["clinton", "thank you  thank you  thank you so much  thank you iowa democrats  thank you all  thank you  what a night  what a great  great night  thank you all  there's no better place to be than right here in iowa with the great elected officials that you have  your governor  your lieutenant governor  your congressional delegation  our wonderful friend  senator tom harkin and his wife ruth  isn't it a special treat to have the speaker of the house  madam speaker here tonight applause  you know  on january  th    someone will stand on the steps of the capitol and raise his or her hand    applause    to take the oath of office as the  th president of the united states of america  and we are here tonight to make sure that that next president is a democrat   applause  because  we know  after seven years of george w  bush  seven years of incompetence  cronyism  and corruption  seven years of a government of the few by the few and for the few  we  as a nation cannot afford any other choice  we have to have a democratic president because we have big challenges to meet  we have a war to end  we have an economy to revive  we have a   million americans to insure  we have an energy crisis to solve  we have a homeland to protect  we have alliances to rebuild and we have a world to lead  so  we are ready for change   applause  but  you know what  change  change is just a word if you do not have the strength and experience to make it happen   applause  we must nominate a nominee who has been tested  and elect a president who is ready to lead on day one   applause  i know what it is going to take to win  i know it's going to take all of us and millions more and a candidate who will work and fight every single day for the next year and then will go into the white house determined to bring about that change that we care so much about  fortunately  i have a little experience standing up and fighting for what i believe is right and what i think america needs and how we can get there together   applause  i have spent   years making a difference and fighting for what i believe matters to people  as a young lawyer  i went to work for the children's defense fund  fighting for abused and neglected kids  fighting for kids in the foster care system  fighting for kids with disabilities  kids without health care  kids without educational opportunities  in arkansas  i helped to expand health care into rural areas and to reform the school system so that every child would have a chance to succeed  as president  i will continue those fights  continue so that we leave no person and no child out of america's promise  as first lady  i fought my heart out for health care  and  well    applause    we might not have been successful that time  but i am so proud that i played a part helping to create the children's health insurance program and to insure   million children  when i'm president  we are going to finish the job and provide quality affordable health care for every single american man  woman  and child   applause  and  as senator  i have continued to fight for family farmers and for workers  to fight for soldiers to get the body armor they needed  and for first responders to get the health care they required after   i have fought against the privatizing of social security and against the failed policies of george w  bush at home and around the world   applause  and  when i am president  i will work to reverse the damage of the eight years of george bush and i will restore the pride and progress in america that should be our birthright  that is who america is  we want to be proud again  we want to be progressive again and we will  when i am president   applause  now  there are some who will say that they do not know where i stand  well  i think you know better than that  i stand where i have stood for   years  i stand with you and with your children  and with every american who needs a fighter in their corner for a better life  now  i know how easy it is in a campaign to get distracted  to focus on who is up and who is down  and who says what about whom  but  that is not what this election is about  this election is about those iowans and those americans who feel invisible in their own country  who feel invisible to their own president  this election is about the woman i met in leclair  she and her husband both work really hard  but they had to sell half the family farm to pay their medical expenses  this election is about a veteran i met in sioux center  who bravely fought in iraq and came home and had to keep fighting to get the health care that he needed  this election is about the mother from greenville  whose daughter got sick and they did not have insurance  and she died  and on her death certificate  they could not even put a cause of death  because nobody had ever made a diagnosis  she was just  years old  there should not be any invisible americans and when i am president  there will not be  we will have a president again  who gets up every day  worries about  thinks about  and fights for every single one of us  that's what america deserves  and that is what my candidacy offers   applause  now  we are getting closer to the iowa caucuses  they are going to be earlier than ever before  i know as the campaign goes on  that it's going to get a little hotter out there  but that is fine with me  because  you know  as harry truman said  if you can't stand the heat  get out of the kitchen  i'll tell you what  i feel really comfortable in the kitchen   applause  so  we have to ask ourselves  what is this election going to be focused on  well  i will tell you what i want to do  i am not interested in attacking my opponents  i am interested in attacking the problems of america  and i believe    applause    we should be turning up the heat on the republicans  they deserve all the heat we can give them   applause  you know  you listen to the republicans who are running this year  they see eight more years of george bush  they see a nine trillion dollar debt and say let's spend trillions more  they see that we had one rush to war and then say  wait  wait  why have one more  well  i think we are going to tell them  in the course of this campaign  that they do not have any more time  america is done with the republicans and their failed policies and their refusal to give america back the future that we deserve  but we democrats  we have to decide what we are for  we democrats believe that the middle class is the backbone of our country and the guarantor of the american dream  so  when the republicans stand by and watch rising gas prices and rising health care costs and increase in college tuition and falling housing prices  and struggling families  and they have turned china into our banker  what are we going to do   i turn up the heat i  and we democrats  we believe that every child has a god given potential that we want to help unlock  so  when the republicans cut head start  and refuse to fix no child left behind  what do we do   i turn up the heat i  and when we democrats fight for universal health care and the republicans veto health care for child and the let the insurance companies and the drug companies undermine health care for the rest of us  what do we do   i turn up the heat i  and we democrats  we believe in labor rights and women's rights and gay rights  and civil rights   applause  and we believe in a department of labor that is actually pro labor  and a department of justice that delivers justice  so  when the republicans tried to turn the clock back on women's rights  when they tried to stomp out labor unions  when they try to undermine civil rights  what do we do   i turn up the heat i  and we democrats  we believe in protecting the environment and we believe in solving the energy crisis  so  when the republicans turn over our energy policy to the oil companies and deny global warming  what do we do   i turn up the heat i  and we democrats  we believe in a government that works for all americans again  we actually believe in appointing qualified people to do the jobs in the united states government  so  when the republicans stock the government with their cronies  when they give no bid contracts to halliburton and legal immunity to blackwater  what do we do   i turn up the heat i  and we democrats  we believe in the power of science and innovation  we know it can lift up lives and grow the economy  so when president bush declares a war on science  when he bans stem cell research  when he tries to turn washington into an evidence free zone and put ideology in front of facts  what do we do   i turn up the heat i  and finally  we believe that our country is both great and good  and as president  i will end the war in iraq  end the era of cowboy diplomacy and restore america's standing and leadership in the world   applause  so  when the republicans engage in fear mongering and saber rattling and talk about world war iii  what do we do to them   i turn up the heat i  well  that is what it's going to take  we are going to turn up the heat on the republicans and we are going to turn america around  but  we cannot do it if we are not united and together  not only democrats  but independents  and even republicans who reject this radical experiment in extremism  i know we can win this election and i know we don't have a choice  i am proud to have the support of so many democrats and democratic leaders from across america  and i am especially proud to have the support of so many democratic leaders from the so  called red states to know that i can win  leaders like the governor beebe of arkansas and senator bayh of indiana and governor ted strickland of ohio  who is here with me tonight   applause  because  democrats know  when we win ohio  we win the white house   applause  i am so grateful to all of the iowans who are supporting me and i absolutely appreciate everything you have done for me and for all of the candidates throughout the campaign  i ask all of you to join my campaign  i ask you to go and stand for me in the caucus on january   if you will stand for me for a night  i will stand and fight for you every day in this campaign and every day in the white house  because together  we are going to restore america's leadership  rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class  reform the government and reclaim the future for our children  let's do it  iowa democrats  let's make sure that we turn up the heat and turn america around  thank you and god bless you "], ["clinton", "hello everyone  i am so sorry i can not be with you in person today  but i am pleased to have the opportunity to talk with you via satellite on the first day of your  th annual convention i especially want to thank joe garcia and the executive board for their outstanding leadership  and i'd like to recognize arlan melendez  one of my campaign co chairs  and melanie benjamin  for their tremendous support and friendship  finally  i want to honor all of you gathered here today for your leadership and service in your nations   and for your contributions to our shared future  your commitment to our environment  to the ties of family and community that bind us to each other  to making decisions based not on just their impact today   but on generations to come   is important for all of us to remember  unfortunately  the united states has not always honored its obligations to native americans   and indian country still feels the effects every single day  during the past seven years  the situation has only gotten worse  we've seen funding cuts and failures to honor tribal sovereignty  president bush has discontinued the tribal government liaison position within the white house and intergovernmental affairs office   a position started by my husband  five of the eight u s  attorneys fired by attorney general gonzales were leaders in prosecuting violence on indian lands  well  i believe it's time for a new beginning  it's time for our government to work together as partners again  like we used to  i'm proud of what we accomplished together during the  s  i was honored to visit reservations during my time as first lady and to work with tribal leaders to support my husband's initiative to train and fund   new native american teachers  and as president  i will restore that partnership and renew our shared mission to lift up our families and build the future our children and grandchildren and future generations deserve  i will start by fully supporting tribal sovereignty and honoring the government to government relationship between tribes and the federal government   not just with talk  but with action  i'll sign an executive order that commits our government to regular and meaningful collaboration with tribal governments  and i will always honor our federal trust responsibility   it's not just a law  it is a fundamental moral obligation  nothing less  second  as president  i will appoint native americans to key positions throughout the federal government  i'll restore the senior position in the office of intergovernmental affairs  this person will serve as my liaison to native american communities  and i'll work to appoint native american judges and others who truly understand tribal sovereignty and respect the needs of native communities  third  improving healthcare in indian country will be at the top of my national agenda  it is unacceptable that the average life expectancy for american indians is nearly five years less than the rest of the population  it is unacceptable that native americans are more than four times as likely to die from diabetes and more than   more likely to die from pneumonia or influenza  it is unacceptable that while the federal government spends nearly   for each medicare recipient   it spends only   per person for indian health service medical care  i was proud to co sponsor the indian health care improvement act amendment  this bill will expand coverage for qualified native americans in the state children's health insurance program  a program i helped to create as first lady  it will also elevate the indian health services director to the assistant secretary level  when i'm president  indian healthcare will be a national priority along with quality  affordable care for every single native american family  i won't rest until i get it done  fourth  i will work every day to ensure that every child in indian country has the chance to live up to his or her god given potential  i'll start right at the beginning  by increasing funding for the indian head start program  a national geographic study from last september revealed that tribal languages are the most vulnerable to extinction in the entire world  that's one of the many reasons why head start is critical  it provides a foundation for the continuation of native languages and support for tribal cultures  in fact  more than   different languages are spoken in indian head start programs  i've also proposed universal pre kindergarten for all native american children  because studies show that providing four year olds with a high quality early education leads to higher achievement and graduation rates and higher earning jobs  i'll increase support for tribal colleges and institutions serving native american students  these institutions play a critical role  providing culturally relevant teaching  community outreach  and research services to tribal communities  so it's time the federal government gave them the resources they deserve  fifth  as president  i'll work to improve housing for native american families  today  roughly   native american families are homeless or under housed  and an estimated   housing units are needed immediately in indian country  so when i'm president  we'll invest in building and rehabilitating affordable housing on indian lands  that means both increasing funding for the native american housing block grant and modernizing the native american housing assistance and self determination act  sixth  i'll work to support energy efficient development in indian country  i fully support the rights of tribal governments to shape their own environmental policies  i'll support your efforts by creating and expanding federal tribal partnerships to promote solar  wind  and other renewable sources of energy  as part of a national weatherization initiative  i'll work to weatherize every low income home in indian country  last winter  the average fuel bill for our families was nearly     it's expected to jump to   this winter  so weatherizing homes is a win win proposition  good for the environment and for our budgets  seventh  we need a renewed focus on law enforcement efforts on native lands  it's simply outrageous that when american indians are twice as likely to be victims of violent crimes  there are fewer than half as many police on tribal lands as non tribal lands  and with the methamphetamine crisis affecting so many communities  the need for law enforcement resources in indian country is greater than ever  i'll start by improving the collection of data on crime in indian country  we can't truly fix the problem unless we truly understand it  i'll also make the investments we need to step up law enforcement in indian country and promote state tribal cooperative agreements to reduce crime and keep our families safe  finally  on this observation of veterans day  i want you to know that as president  i will stand up for our veterans every day  as you know  native americans have one of the highest rates of service of any group in america  at the end of the twentieth century  we had nearly   native american veterans in america  i believe one of the most fundamental obligations of the next president is to keep faith with these veterans   to provide the healthcare and benefits they've earned and the respect and gratitude they deserve  so i'll fully fund the va  i'll cut the red tape  i'll create a new gi bill for a new generation of veterans  i will never back down and never stop fighting for those who fought for us  in closing  i want again to thank you again for giving me the opportunity to speak with you today   it means a great deal to me  and i urge you to do everything you can to make your voices heard in this election  your votes can make the difference in electing a president who is a true partner with indian country  if you give me the honor of being elected  i will be that partner  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", "i'm delighted to be here  i apologize for being a little late  apparently  there was more of a headwind than tail and it took us a lot longer and i apologize for that  and i thank you so much for being here and being part of this event today  i want to recognize a few people because i'm so pleased that we could have this event here at the boys club  and that wouldn't have been possible without roger friesen and the boys club of sioux city for hosting us today  and i want to thank my good friend tom vilsack  former governor vilsack  who's here  i want to also thank danny holeman the head of afscme here in iowa  i want to thank representative roger wendt and his wife anita  thank them for being here  teresa wolff the democratic chair for woodbury county  also i want to thank our guests up on the stage here who you will hear from in a minute  in addition to sally pederson the former lieutenant governor and a member of our women's leadership council here in iowa  sally has a lot of experience on the subject i'm going to be speaking about in a minute  as do our two other participants  one is jane seely whose daughter sara seely asked me a question last week when i was here in iowa and it turned out that sara is autistic and asked me an excellent question and it got me thinking about all of the families that are dealing with autism and all of their challenges  and doctor patricia gilbaugh who is one of sara seely's care coordinators and care givers is with us now  now i see a lot of people holding these bumper strips over their eyes because the lights are so powerful on their eyes and that's not good  is it  so maybe if somebody could hear my voice and we could do something about these lights  i'm sorry about that  but that's mother nature and we'll have to put up with that  ell  today we are here at the boys club because of the work that the boys club does every single day here in sioux city  and one of their missions which they have recognized is the critical need for services for children with autism  so the boys club began providing those services  now sally has been a strong leader and advocate on behalf of families with autism for years  as lieutenant governor she led the vilsack pederson administration's initiatives for health care and human services  and she has been an effective advocate for people with disabilities  her work with the homestead  which serves adults living with autism  is an example that i'd like to see replicated across the country  she came to this as most people who are advocates do  because of her own child  and to the extent we're addressing autism today as part of the presidential campaign  it's because of parents like sally who fought for their children when no one else would even acknowledge there was a problem  driven by their love and devotion  mothers and fathers across the country have raised awareness  demanded funding  and opened our eyes to the needs of so many children  now  when i was in law school  i took a special year at the yale child study center  that was back in the very early  's  at that time  science was still blaming parents for autism  and they particularly blamed mothers  and i remember reading some of the so called research and in particular the work of one scientist who had a lot of national and international prominence for his theories  and i thought  you know  that just can't be right  there's got to be more to it to that  i later moved to little rock where one of my friend had a son with autism  and i spent time in her home  i spent time with her and her son and my instinct perhaps as a mother was that this could not be the explanation  now  despite what science used to do  blaming the parents for autistic kids  now we know that parents are the child's best hope to deal with what is a very complicated set of conditions  i wanted to discuss this issue today because the recent increases in autism are alarming  the number of children with an autism spectrum disorder  that means across the spectrum from what's called asberger syndrome  where kids with it may be or adults with it may be not as socially interactive as you or i would be but they can function pretty well  all the way to the most severe forms of autism including seizures and mental retardation   all along this spectrum there's so many different symptoms and different capacities that people have  the number with the autism spectrum disorder has grown from   in   in   to   in   in   and the numbers continue to rise  the autism society of america estimates that   million americans and their families are now affected by autism  they believe that could reach four million in the next decade  autism affects people of all racial  ethnic  and social groups  although it is four times more likely to strike boys than girls which is why the boys club tackling this here in sioux city is such a great contribution  and autism is costing the united states at least   billion dollars a year  the symptoms have become all too familiar  the child who never makes eye contact  doesn't notice when his dad comes home after work  the child who stacks blocks over and over and over again  the child who would rather twirl in a corner by herself than play with other kids  these children have so much to contribute  but they are often trapped inside their own worlds  unable to communicate  yet for all the people autism affects  we don't know that much about what causes it and why it is increasing in number  we don't know how to cure it and we don't even know the best ways to treat it  we don't have enough services to care for those who have it or support their families  i think it's time we had a government and a president that recognized the seriousness of autism and addressed it head on  i am committed to this cause  and as sally said i have been fighting for children  particularly children with needs  children with disabilities  children who are abused or neglected  children without adequate education or health care for my entire adult life  once i went to work for the children's defense fund  my first assignment was to go door to door in new bedford  massachusetts and figure out why so many children who were listed in the census figures weren't enrolled in school  i went door to door  and home after home  i found reason  i found children who were blind or who were deaf  children in wheelchairs  children with behavioral problems  they were kept home because schools wouldn't accommodate them  i knew then that i wanted to spend my life being a voice for children   children who had been left behind and too often forgotten  i wanted to fight to give all children the same opportunities i had growing up  today  one of the most urgent   and least understood   challenges facing our children is this rising tide of autism  that's why as first lady  i fought hard for more awareness and more funding for autism  i was very proud when my husband signed the children's health act of   which had a special focus on autism research and launched a long term study on environmental influences on children's health  in the senate  i helped develop and co sponsored the combating autism act of   which was signed into law by president bush  the bill authorized   billion over five years to combat autism through environmental research  surveillance  awareness  early detection and early intervention  and in march of this year  i introduced the expanding the promise for individuals with autism act along with my colleague  senator allard from colorado  this focuses on improving the quality of life for individuals living with autism  attaining appropriate services that will cross the life span  and as president  i will build on my work with a strong commitment to fighting autism  i'll start  first  by investing heavily in research to understand the causes of autism and hopefully to start finding cures  i will invest a total of   billion over five years to help fight autism  because president bush signed the bill but refused to provide the funding  a familiar story  and he just vetoed a bill that congress included funding for autism in  specifically  we need to fund research to identify the causes of autism  including possible environmental causes  that includes expanding our system for health tracking  so that we can look for links between the environment and the rise of autism and other diseases  that's something that i've been fighting for since   i've introduced an environmental health tracking bill every congress since then because i think we need to face up to the fact that there are three main causes of illness or conditions that impact people  genetics  behavior and environment and usually it's a combination of one or more of those triggers  and we haven't done enough to really figure out to what it is we are exposing ourselves and our children to from the environment that triggers  perhaps  a genetic response  that makes people who are susceptible to autism show that  usually it's diagnosed around   months  if you're lucky to find somebody who knows the conditions  lots of times it doesn't happen until the child is   or   and that means that you've delayed the treatment and intervention that could help  i'll also create an autism task force charged with investigating evidence based treatments  interventions  and services  i'm modeling this after what has happened in breast cancer  breast cancer survivors became partners with physicians and scientists and researchers in finding what was going on that caused breast cancer and what the best treatments were  once the task force has done its work  i'll act on its recommendations  more research is our best hope for combating autism  and  as president  i will fund it  for the children and adults who have autism  i'll invest in the best possible care throughout their lifetimes  i'll commit   million annually to provide care and improve the quality of life for individuals living with autism  this starts with better screening  the american academy of pediatrics recently called for a universal autism screening for all children under the age of   now  i applaud this and we're going to have to really encourage the academy and pediatricians and other physicians to learn about the signals and symptoms and begin to coordinate information so they can identify it earlier  to reinforce those efforts  i'll ensure that we get screening information to professionals who deal with young children through federal programs such as head start  medicaid and chip  next  i'll expand access to post diagnosis care so that we have a seamless transition from diagnosis to treatment  today  the number of children affected is growing far faster than the care available  that means parents often have to hear a doctor say   your child has autism  and then get sent away with no good options for care  this is especially tragic because we know early intervention can make all the difference  as autistic children reach school age  we'll support them in public schools wherever possible  the number of children in public schools with autism has doubled in the past three years alone  but the training for teachers hasn't  in fact  a lot of teachers get no training whatsoever  i will provide funding for teacher training so they can fulfill their mission of teaching every child  and we won't stop caring about autistic individuals just because they grow up  with access to the right types of services  including housing  vocational rehabilitation  we can help adults with autism live rich and full lives  so i will help states create and provide appropriate services for adults with autism  for parents  we'll create an online national technical assistance center to provide the best possible information about autism treatments  interventions  and services  and finally  as president  i will fund quality  affordable health care for every single american  my american health choices plan lets you keep your existing coverage if you like it  but it provides affordable choices if you don't have them  and it covers every single american  what happens in families of autism  or families with diabetes or families with a history of cancer or heart disease or any other condition  is that oftentimes insurance is so expensive you can't afford it  when the insurance doesn't cover the very thing you need it for  everyone will have access to the same choices members of congress have  which includes mental health care  i always say  if it's good enough for members of congress  it's good enough for american families  under my plan  you and your child will never be denied coverage because of pre existing conditions or risk factors  parents will no longer be burdened by unmanageable premiums just because their children have autism  and when all americans have regular healthcare  we'll be able to reach so many more children early on  my health plan  my autism agenda  and all of the policies that i've put forward are united by my belief that it's up to us to reclaim the future for our children  and ensure that every child has a chance to live up to his or her god given potential  we have learned that children and adults with autism have great potential indeed  these are not only special needs individuals  these are special individuals  they have a lot to offer  just last week  at an event in vinton  sara seely  a young woman with autism   i had no idea  i was just looking out at a crowd like this  and she was eagerly waving her hand with that big smile on her face  asking a question about pollution and problem of deforestation  and she said later  she is  obsessed with tigers  now  i have no doubt that she will make a difference in our world  and i am so pleased to be joined by sara's mom   jane seely   and her doctor   dr  patricia gilbaugh   today  sara's not alone  so we should never give up on any child  i think that is one of our obligations  and together  we can help all those living with autism to live up to their potential  and we can commit ourselves to conquering this really difficult and very frustrating and discouraging condition that strikes children  literally out of the blue  there is no marker for it  we don't know it's coming  and oftentimes they are not quite sure what is happening until the diagnosis is delivered  so  now i want to turn to three people who have lived with it  who can add to what i said before we turn to take your questions on any issue that's on your minds  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", " b draws key contrasts with obama health plan b   i hillary clinton delivered remarks today about her health care plan  continuing to define the contrasts between her plan and senator obama's  for more information on the differences  please visit  www facts hillaryhub com  the following is an excerpt from her speech i   among the democrats  all of us except senator obama have universal health care that have put forth a plan   governor  richardson  senator edwards  senator dodd  we've put forth universal health care plans because we know if we don't cover everybody we're going to leave millions and millions of people out  it's a substantive and important difference because if you don't start with the goal of covering every american  you will never get there   here's how my plan works  if you already have private insurance and you're happy with it  nothing changes   you keep that insurance  but if you don't have health insurance   or if you don't like the insurance you have   you can choose from the wide variety of options that are available to members of congress   now all americans will have a responsibility to get and keep health insurance  i believe when you make this the law of the land  americans will follow it and will purchase health insurance   far more than if we don't have that requirement  we'll provide tax credits to ensure that people can afford it   and we'll give tax credits to small businesses so that they can cover more of their employees   if you want to cover everyone  you have to make health care a shared responsibility  i know you need to have the willingness to stand up to the insurance companies and the drug companies and demand universal coverage  and that's why i don't understand why we have this difference on the democratic side because  if anything  democrats should stand for universal health care  that distinguishes us from the republicans  the republicans don't believe in it  democrats do and we should fight for it   and we'll need a president with the experience and the strength to make that happen  otherwise we will be right back here in another   or   or   years  and we will still have  's of millions of people uninsured  and  in fact  our problems will be even worse because we would have lost more jobs because employers won't be willing to provide insurance  they will move jobs offshore because they don't want to have those benefits and we will not be either competitive or living up to our ideals  it is impossible to get universal health care if you don't have a mandate  that is a key difference between my plan and senator obama's plan  now  when senator obama was a state senator in illinois  he helped to create a health care task force that looked into how to best cover everyone in illinois with health insurance  they released their report earlier this year  and they made it very clear if you want to cover everyone  you need to require people to get health insurance  otherwise  you will fail to cover   of the uninsured   now there are a number of ways of doing this  one sensible step would be to use what's called default enrollment  if you don't make a choice  well  we set up a system where people are automatically enrolled when they come into contact with the health care system or with schools or colleges  you could also work with employers so that they automatically enroll people  the congress has ideas about this and we'll work to make sure that these mandates are enforceable   but what's strange is that senator obama's plan actually does have a mandate  but only for children  no requirement for adults  now  i've worked on this issue a very long time  if you believe you can enforce a mandate on children that means you enforce the mandate on the parents of the children to enroll the children  so why would you leave out the parents of the children  because what happens when you leave out the parents is that they're less likely to get health care for their own children  you see  this is all connected  and i'm proud that senator edwards agrees with me  senator dodd agrees with me  governor richardson agrees with me congressman kucinich has a different approach  but he gets everyone covered to have universal health care   if we don't get universal health care  then we will be betraying the democratic party's principles  and it's important that those who will caucus on january  rd understand this difference  senator obama's plan does not  and cannot  cover all americans  he called his plan universal  then he called it  virtually universal  but it is not either  when it comes to truth in labeling  it simply flunks the test   he's been saying there's no difference between our plans  but his plan would leave at least   million americans uninsured   including more than   people right here in iowa  so why don't we just say everyone against the wall  don't get insurance  we're very sorry but we're just not going to have a plan that covers you  who's going to choose who doesn't get covered  who's going to leave out   million  or   people in iowa  that's more than half the population of des moines  that's a huge difference for those who get left out like the daughter of the woman that i met in greenville  and it's a huge difference to me to leave   million people virtually invisible  because that is what we would do   well  when i am president  there will be no invisible americans and there will be no americans without health care  that is one of my highest priorities  and i know it's going to be a tough fight "], ["clinton", "well i am so honored and personally delighted to be here  and i want to thank rick and kay warren for bringing us together this week around world aids day  and i want to thank their tremendous staff and the volunteers and everyone who helped make this happen  i'm grateful for the opportunity to share our commitment about dealing with the global scourge of hiv aids  i also want to recognize two first ladies  the first lady of zambia and the first lady of rwanda  i am delighted that they are here representing their countries and their people  and first   applause  let me first say how relieved bill and i were to hear that saddleback was spared from the recent wildfires   and how impressed and moved we were to hear about the love and support that you gave those who were not so fortunate  it's another example of the way in which this church is not measured by numbers  yes  the numbers are big  they're certainly impressive  but it's measured by your impact  it's measured by the meaning that you give to lives here within this complex and so far beyond its boundaries  and the commitment that you demonstrate both to our faith in god and to doing his work here on earth is exemplary and that is one of the many reasons that i wanted to be here today  you know  rick has helped so many people with his lessons for a  day spiritual journey  but he knows those   days are just the beginning  my own faith journey is approaching a half a century  and i know how far i still have to go  but i have been blessed in my life  both starting in my family and in the church of my childhood  to be guided every step of the way  a mother  who taught sunday school and made sure that my brothers and i were there the minute the church doors opened  a father  who kneeled by the side of his bed every night of his life to say his prayers  a minister of our youth fellowship  who took it as part of his mission to show the group of white  suburban  middle class kids that there was a bigger world outside  and a prayer group that formed for me shortly after i came to the white house   a group of extraordinary women  both democrats and republicans  whose love and support sustained me  i've often been asked if i'm a praying person and i have always responded that i was fortunate enough to be raised to understand that the power and purpose of prayer  but  had i not been  probably one week in the white house would have turned me into one   laughter  it's wonderful to know that the sustaining power of prayer is there for so many of us  one of my favorite passages in scripture is that famous line in james that faith without works is dead  but i have concluded that works without faith is just too hard  it cannot be sustained over one's life or over the generations  and it's important for us to recognize how here  in what you're doing  faith and work come together  you understand that  or as rick might say  creed and deed  and what extraordinary important work your faith supports   fighting against spiritual emptiness  corrupt leadership  poverty  illiteracy  and diseases like aids around the world  twenty five years ago  when men   mostly young gay men   began dying from a disease that had no name  we could not have  and certainly did not  talk about it in church  it would not have been proper  it would not have been polite  it would have been discomforting for so many of us  but the disease itself was not polite  and ignoring it did not make it go away  it only made the problem worse  because the disease fed on ignorance and fear and  let's be honest  on prejudice  we are taught to heal the sick  to love them as our own  but twenty five years ago  too many died alone  ashamed to tell their families what had made them ill  in the gospel  we learn that one third of christ's ministry was healing the sick  and if you read those moments  when jesus is presented with someone who is ill  it becomes abundantly clear that christ had a choice  he could have been too busy  he could have thought you know this is not the message of the day  i don't need to do this  i've already done it in capernaum so i don't need to do it again  but he made the choice  he never asked why someone was sick  he just healed and ministered those in need  that is what saddleback has chosen too  other churches  nonprofits  and governments have also chosen to heal  to help  to redeem  for many of us the golden rule calls on us to act  and so we've come a long way  not only can we talk about aids in church  but churches are leading the way  thanks to leaders like rick and kay  christians have embraced the sickest among us  and have fought the disease itself  we've had breakthroughs in treatment that allow those with this disease to live much longer  and we are hoping for breakthroughs in vaccines and other cures  but let us not grow complacent or too comfortable  let us not feel that because we're here at this conference or as a member of saddleback or some other church represented today that we are doing our part  because we have such a long way to go  here in america  we still have an aids epidemic  hiv infection rates are rising among gay men again and among african americans and latinos  the disease takes a disproportionate toll on the poor and communities of color  and it is an outrage that hiv aids is the leading cause of death for black women between the ages of   and   in the united states of america  around the world  aids remains a plague of biblical proportions  in too many places  ignorance about aids prevails and the stigma remains strong  and where ignorance and prejudice live  the disease thrives  when i walked through the world vision village  i was told the story of kambo   a young kenyan boy who lost first his father and his mother to what is called the  big disease  and for years his grandmother had told him he did not have it  but after the death of his mother  he began to sicken  finally was tested and found out he was positive  even before the positive results came in  the boys he played soccer with began to shun him  it became increasingly uncomfortable to go to school  so the stigma is one of the real evils that has to be combated if we are to take on hiv aids around the world  we should take heart that the united nations recently revised its estimate of the number of people infected with hiv downward from   million to   million  but please don't take any comfort  there are still   people infected and   who die from aids every day  aids is still the number one cause of death in africa  where   percent of the hiv positive children in the world live  don't let anyone tell you that the time for alarm has passed  we can't slow  we can't rest  and we can't quit  i've seen the tragedy of aids firsthand  from a dear friend  who told me in the early  s   much i must confess to my surprise in those days   that he was gay  he had the unnamed disease  and he died shortly after  to the twelve year old girl that i met in northern thailand at a shelter for former prostitutes  she had been sold into prostitution at the age of eight by her family for a satellite television  she was put to work in bangkok's brothels  she contracted aids and was turned out and returned home to a family that would not take her in  she did find refuge in the shelter  when i met her she was in a wheelchair  so weak she didn't have the strength to talk  as i knelt down beside her  i could see the skin stretched tightly across her cheekbones  i thought of my own daughter and of all the girls her age who speak with such excitement about their futures  and about how cruel an injustice it was that this child would never know hers  a week after i returned to america  people running the shelter contacted me to tell me she had died  to this day  i think of that gentle face and those warm eyes and what might have been done to spare her the fate she met  she may have died on the other side of the world  but aids is not just an african problem  it's not just an asian problem  and it's not just an american problem  and it's certainly not someone else's problem  it's a problem of our common humanity  and we are called to respond  with love  with mercy  and with urgency  as president  i will wage the fight against aids with the passionate commitment it demands  i will ask for   billion over five years to combat hiv aids   applause  and i will ask for more money to tackle tuberculosis and malaria around the world as well  i will build on the funding levels in pepfar and on the leadership that the president and mrs  bush have shown  to demonstrate that the fight against hiv aids  tb  and malaria is an american commitment that exemplifies what we can do if we seek bipartisan solutions to nonpartisan problems  if we start acting not as republicans and democrats but as americans again  this is also a great opportunity for partnership  there are many churches and faith based groups here in our country and increasingly in other parts of the world who are understanding the urgency of this mission  there are many foundations and not for profit organizations like the gates foundation or my husband's work for the clinton foundation  they are supplementing what we are doing through the government  and they are doing what the government cannot do  and it is that partnership that is uniquely american  when i was privileged to represent our country around the world  traveling to more than   countries  i was often struck by how so much of the rest of the world did not understand the voluntary sector in america  as rick was saying  the private  the public  the parish   there was no sense that individuals would volunteer their time  give up their money to help meet a common need  but we are setting forth that example  as well  in the work that is now occurring  by doing this  which is the right thing to do  we are also helping to improve america's standing in the world  we are putting a different face on our country  we are reaching out in a common search for answers  and we will be able not only to build on that work  to save lives  to prevent the spread of this disease  but also to create a broader platform for the values and ideals that we hold dear  in order to accomplish my goals as president i have laid out a very comprehensive hiv aids agenda  first  my administration will invest in treatments and capacity building by improving health systems across africa and doubling the number of people receiving anti retroviral treatment with u s  funding in five years  everyone who is hiv positive must have access to these drugs  i want particularly to target mother to child transmission  we know how to stop the spread of the virus from mother to child but we don't have the resources and the system behind delivering the drugs that are necessary  i believe we should do much more to encourage voluntary testing  but in order to do that it must be accompanied by counseling and there has to be a public education and outreach effort to undermine and diminish the stigma  some countries are beginning to do this and we should encourage them  secondly  i'll invest heavily in prevention  teaching young men and women how to be responsible  how best to protect themselves  i visited uganda ten years ago to highlight their a b c program  and it produced results  abstinence  be faithful  use condoms if necessary  and this has to be a message that we do much more to communicate effectively throughout areas that are particularly vulnerable  third  i'll continue to invest in research to develop an effective vaccine and eventually a cure  there will be setbacks  as we have recently seen  but that doesn't mean we can afford to quit  and finally  i'll restart the battle against aids here in america  but i know that neither money nor government alone will solve this problem  corinthians tells us that the body is made up of many parts  and  though all its parts are many  they form one body  well we need  as though we were one body  to use every resource at our hands  our disposal  because as kay and rick have advocated  the fight against aids must be done hand in hand  building relationships with churches around the world and here at home  because if we fail to engage churches in combating aids  we will fail to conquer aids  as you have shown  there are six things churches can do  care for those who are infected and their families  encourage testing  even become testing centers  unleash volunteers  reduce the stigma by showing it's not a sin to be sick  champion healthy behavior  and be treatment coaches for those taking medication  i would add that churches also must tend to the spiritual side of this crisis  because aids is not just a medical emergency  who will comfort the orphan dying alone after losing both parents to aids  who will heal the emptiness that leads thousands of girls to be trafficked for a satellite television or a few dollars into prostitution and modern day slavery each year  who will provide stability and hope in communities devastated by aids  who will welcome the drug addict using dirty needles or the gay teenager seeking safety and guidance  just as in my own life i need both faith and work to be whole   healing the world will take both faith and work as well  we are compelled to address aids because it's the right thing to do  but we can also acknowledge it's smart  as well  aids is turning back the clock on the development that we have seen in africa and elsewhere  it is destabilizing countries and undermining economies  in some places  aids can be even more destructive than war  it is watering the weeds of volatility and despair  and we should be planting seeds of hope and progress  and nothing will help america more to win hearts and minds around the world more than showing america's true heart on problems like aids  tuberculosis  and malaria  in fact  we know our values are the source of our greatest strength  as the peace plan has recognized so clearly  however  we can't address aids in isolation  aids is deeply intertwined with so many other crises  and if we are serious about beating this disease  we have to address them as well  to end aids  we need to end malaria in africa  malaria is overwhelming the health infrastructures in the developing world  accounting for   percent of health spending in many countries   money we need to fight aids  malaria is a challenge to our conscience in its own right  it is appalling that more than a million people die every year from a bug bite  and nearly all of them are children  a child in africa dies from malaria every   seconds  we made a decision to eradicate malaria in north america and in europe  and we can do the same in africa and asia  so i'll set a goal of ending all deaths from malaria in africa by the end of my second term  we can do this if we are committed together  we also need to aggressively confront tuberculosis   a disease that takes the lives of so many aids victims before they should go  a disease that is mutating to become drug resistant  that endangers all of us  it may start in africa or in a prison in russia or in some other far away place  but it endangers all of us because in a world without boundaries  people and viruses move freely  to end aids  we also need to educate all the world's children  education not only reduces poverty and improves health  it's a key form of prevention  it is what you might call a  social vaccine  against the spread of hiv aids  but today    million young children   most of them girls   will not set foot in a school  and hundreds of millions will not go beyond primary school  in fact  there are more young children out of school in africa  than there are children in school in america  every day we don't act  we deny more children the childhoods they deserve  we deny future mothers the ability to read a story to their children or a warning on a medicine label  we deny what is at the heart of human dignity  the power to learn  to discover  to grow  to reach one's god given potential  so as president  i'll work to pass and then sign my bipartisan education for all act to help provide a quality  basic education for every single child around the world  and finally  to end aids  we need to stand up for women's rights  aids takes a particularly harsh toll on women and girls   about   percent of people living with aids in sub saharan africa are women  they are young girls who are taken in marriage or in rape  they are women who are abused and mistreated  who have no say in their own lives  who work from sun up to sun down  who never believed they have any way to speak up or be heard  their societies and their country don't recognize their rights to health care or education  they don't participate in the economy in a formal way  although their work keeps people alive and thriving  i remember once driving through africa on a bus with a group of distinguished experts and in field after field and marketplace after marketplace we saw women working  women working hard  carrying firewood  carrying water  selling their products in the villages  and the economist said   well  it's too bad that all of their work doesn't matter in the formal economy  and i said  well  if they stopped all of their work  the formal economy would collapse  and it is time we pay tribute and respect to the hard work of such women  and it is long past time that we do everything we can to stand up for the proposition that women's rights are human rights  as i saw so starkly at that shelter in thailand  girls denied their human rights are girls at risk of aids  and even in our own country today  women are now the face of aids  in   i went to beijing on behalf of our country for the united nation's fourth world conference on women  i said what most of us believe here in america  that women's rights are human rights  but it was considered a radical statement  i remember being on the voice of america shortly after i came back  it was a call in radio show that was beamed throughout the world and a caller from iran called and he asked me  well  what did i mean by saying that women's rights were human rights  and i said  i want you to stop for a minute  maybe close your eyes and think about all the rights you have as a man  the right to work  the right to pursue an education  the right to start a business  the right to be active in your country's affairs  those are the rights i'm talking about  the rights that are the real core of who we are as human beings  it's important we continue to work to empower women to take responsibility for themselves and their futures with initiatives on everything from maternal health to micro credit and entrepreneurship  i'll continue the work i started as first lady and now as a senator to end the buying and selling of girls and women into modern day slavery  now  i know this won't be easy  but i also know the power of america at our best  and i know the power of faith and of people of faith  when we heed isaiah's call to lift up our voices like trumpets  the faith community lifted up its voice against slavery and helped lead america to end that evil  the faith community lifted its voice against discrimination here in america and against apartheid in south africa and helped end both  the faith community lifted its voice for debt relief for the world's poorest countries  and gave many countries a fresh start in the jubilee year  today the faith community is speaking out against genocide in darfur  taking on global warming and we can see from this room the awesome power to address the aids pandemic  together i believe  we can write the next chapter in this history  it is a proud and grace filled history  thank you  thank you to saddleback  thanks to all of you for the work you are doing and for living your faith in such a visible way  and i appreciate the opportunity to add my voice to yours  thank you all very much and god speed "], ["clinton", "thank you all very much  it is a real pleasure to be here and i appreciate those kind words  it's wonderful being back in the city   and to have a chance to come here again  i believe for the fourth time  and to have a chance to speak with you about an issue that is on the minds of everyone  whether i'm here in new york or in new hampshire  or in iowa or any of the other places i've been traveling to lately  it's a topic of conversation that has to be put at the top of our nation's agenda  now we know that not far from here wall street is humming  the phones are ringing  the blackberries are buzzing  and people are making billions of transactions that raise capital for corporations and deliver value to shareholders every day  and what happens on wall street today   like every day   will ripple across the country and the world  i'm proud to represent new york  to represent the financial capital of the world  i see a lot of people who i recognize in this audience that are integral to what happens in our markets  how we create wealth  how we provide a dynamic economy that will hold out the promise of a better life for so many of our fellow citizens  but indeed for people far flung from here  i do want to recognize speaker silver  shelly silver  thank you very much for being here with me  and we in new york  probably more than anyone anywhere  know how critically important is it for our economy and for the global economy  that wall street stay on the cutting edge of finance and remain what it always has been  the global finance capital of the world  but we know that the standard for any economic system is not just that it creates growth  but that it lifts up families across america who work hard and dream big every day  as we've seen the home foreclosure crisis these past few years build  the ripples from wall street we know  can have a significant impact on families far away in pahrump  nevada  where i recently was and other places that might never give much of a thought to what goes on here  but whose daily lives will be impacted  as we've seen with the home foreclosure crisis  too many american families are not sharing in the growth that is created and driven from this city  now  productivity has risen   percent among american workers over the past six years  yet wages have stayed flat  and family incomes have fallen by nearly   there are five million more people in poverty here in our country than there were in   on top of stagnant wages  we've seen a rise in economic anxiety  students struggling with the skyrocketing cost of college  families burdened by health care costs  premiums have doubled in the last six years  and we see the increasing role that energy prices play in people's lives  gas prices have doubled in the past seven years  home heating costs continue to rise  in fact  the typical family is paying   more for energy this year than in   that's like a   energy tax   more than   times what the typical family got under the bush tax cuts  we've seen people hit hard by a deepening housing crisis  families who've worked hard  thought they were doing the right thing  who've spent years scrimping and saving to buy a house  but their dream of homeownership has turned into a nightmare of escalating payments and threatening letters  in short  we've seen too many middle class families struggling in an economy that is simply not working for them right now  an economy that  in recent months  has been the subject of increasingly worrisome headlines about weakening consumer confidence  about a declining dollar and ballooning national debt  now these economic problems are certainly not all wall street's fault   not by a long shot  but the reality of our interconnected economy is that what happens on wall street impacts main streets across america  it happens sometimes within minutes  sometimes over the course of months or even years  if we're honest  we need to acknowledge that wall street has played a significant role in the current problems  and in particular in the housing crisis  a  see no evil  policy that financed irresponsible mortgage lending  a bond rating system riddled with conflicts of interest  a habit of issuing complex and opaque securities that even wall street itself doesn't seem to understand  i believe we need a new beginning in our economic policy   one that strengthens our middle class and ensures that prosperity is widely shared  and is based on an ethic of shared responsibility  a new beginning that makes wall street shoulder its responsibility for this crisis  and that gives homeowners the breathing room they need  one that makes the most well off among us pay our fair share and gives the middle class the help it needs for education  health care  and retirement security  our economy has been at risk by investment schemes aimed at making not just a few  but many extra dollars  and we need to start insisting on the right rules and transparency so this doesn't happen again  so i'm here today to call on wall street to do its part   to help end the foreclosure crisis that is devastating middle class families and threatening the health of our economy  wall street needs to be part of a comprehensive solution that brings to the table all those responsible and calls on them to do their part  wall street helped create the foreclosure crisis  and wall street needs to help us solve it  let's start with an honest  clear eyed assessment of what went so terribly wrong  over the past seven years  as incomes fell and wages stagnated  many families were lured into risky mortgages with rates that later jumped beyond what they could afford  now  we can debate what was technically illegal  we can debate what should be defined as predatory  but there is no debate that what happened did not reflect the best of our financial system  it did not reflect prudence  transparency  or even an understanding that behind large bundles of securitized mortgages are real families who were led into bad situations by people who should have  and even did  know better  as a result    million foreclosure notices have gone out this year  an increase of   percent from last year  and the worst may be yet to come  the rates on   million mortgages are set to escalate over the next two years  meanwhile  there's been an unprecedented national decline in home values  middle class families can't afford to refinance their loans  and it's gotten a lot harder to sell their homes  many families are finding themselves trapped   stuck with mortgages they can't pay and expenses they can't meet  so they're facing wrenching choices  pay their medical bills   or pay their mortgage  put off retirement   or lose their homes  and many people who worked s hard and did try to follow the rules are receiving that same grim letter in the mail that says  get out now  i met a woman in derry  new hampshire   a stay at home mom with three children   whose husband lost his good paying job  he was in the computer industry  they kept making their loan payments for six months after he was laid off  but just at that time  their interest rate ballooned from about   percent to about   percent  they tried to file for bankruptcy  but the bank still foreclosed on their home  and even after her husband found a new  high paying job within a year  they were unable to make their back payments  basically the door was shut in their face  when i met her  it was literally the day before her family was being forced out of their home with nowhere to go  as the foreclosures mount  the housing crisis is also becoming a municipal crisis  cities and towns face the prospect of blight  higher crime rates  vacant properties marring neighborhoods  cutting tax receipts  and dragging down property values  and i believe the housing crisis also threatens the economy as a whole  even americans who don't face foreclosures are feeling the impact    percent of the total wealth of middle class families resides in their home equity  and home equity withdrawals accounted for more than   percent of families' disposable income in   so as housing prices decline  people have less money to draw on for everything else  from medical bills to car payments to college tuition  we know that consumers are the backbone of our economy that has been true from the beginning  it's been especially true in the last years  and right now consumers are hurting  i talked with ceos of the some of our large discount retailers  they tell me that the amount of money being spent is down  the number of shopping days has decreased  people come in the beginning of the month when they actually get paid and in the middle of the month but otherwise they're much scarcer as consumers than they used to be  with the holidays quickly approaching  a lot of middle class families are feeling the pinch  and the global financial markets are also suffering  risky loans have been packaged and sold around the world  mortgage companies have collapsed  financial firms have recorded losses in the tens of billions  and there's predictions for tens of billions more  central banks have had to step in to keep the system running  and banks are reluctant to give out loans  so companies are finding it harder and harder to get the capital they need to grow and create new jobs even if they're not in the home industry  now  who's exactly to blame for the housing crisis  well  that's always a question that the press and people ask and i think there's plenty of blame to go around  responsibility belongs to mortgage lenders and brokers  who irresponsibly lowered underwriting standards  pushed risky mortgages  and hid the details in the fine print  responsibility belongs to the administration and to regulators  who failed to provide adequate oversight  and who failed to respond to the chorus of reports that millions of families were being taken advantage of  responsibility belongs to the rating agencies  who woefully underestimated the risks involved in mortgage securities  and certainly borrowers share responsibility as well  homebuyers who paid extra fees to avoid documenting their income should have known they were getting in over their heads  speculators who were busy buying two  three  four houses to sell for a quick buck don't deserve our sympathy  but finally  responsibility also belongs to wall street  which not only enabled but often encouraged reckless mortgage lending  mortgage lenders didn't have balance sheets big enough to write millions of loans on their own  so wall street originated and packaged the loans that common sense warned might very well have ended in collapse and foreclosure  some people might say wall street only helped to distribute risk  i believe wall street shifted risk away from people who knew what was going on onto the people who did not  wall street may not have created the foreclosure crisis  but wall street certainly had a hand in making it worse  we also must recognize  though  that good things have happened in the housing market  home ownership is at the heart of the american dream  and ownership rates rose to a record   percent in   that means millions of new stakeholders in their communities  and the largest gains were among low income and minority families  the challenge for us is to preserve the best of this system   which has allowed people to own their own homes   while getting rid of the abuses  and to do that  we need to look at this problem  as complex as it is  honestly  we also need a president who understands the complexity and magnitude of the challenges we face because obviously it's not only about the mortgage industry and the credit crunch  it's about our debt  about the declining dollar  about all the challenges we face in the global economy  i'm confident we can navigate through this but we can't do so acting like ostriches or in a fit of denial  we have to be willing to roll up our sleeves and start doing what we do better than anybody in the world and that is solving problems  earlier this week  i wrote to treasury secretary paulson urging him to fashion an agreement with the mortgage industry and wall street that matches the scale of the problem  i'm heartened that the administration has heeded an earlier call of mine to convene a  crisis conference  of housing stakeholders   lenders  investors  mortgage servicers  regulators  representatives of homeowners  and others   to convert unworkable mortgages into stable loans that families can afford  this is a moment for shared responsibility in america  investors  lenders  and homeowners all have a part to play and sacrifices to make  if the agreement is inadequate  or the talks fail outright  the cost to our economy will only increase  for this  crisis conference  to succeed  wall street must be on board  wall street has a responsibility for the past as well as an enormous stake in the future  so today  i'm calling on investors who control the mortgages that need modifying to be part of the solution  you are at the end of a long chain of decision making and responsibility  but without your cooperation  a voluntary solution can be of limited effectiveness  i urge wall street and the mortgage industry to voluntarily agree to the following three steps  first  we need a moratorium of at least   days on foreclosures of subprime  owner occupied homes  the moratorium will stop foreclosures until lenders and servicers have contacted borrowers and frozen mortgage rates  it will also give financial counselors time to work with families  second  we need to freeze the monthly rate on subprime adjustable rate mortgages  with the freeze lasting at least five years until the mortgages have been converted into affordable  fixed rate loans  a rate freeze is critical  an average of   billion in loans will reset each month next year  and the average reset will increase monthly payments by   to   percent  these rate resets are the major driver of the foreclosure costs  the long rate freeze will give the housing market time to stabilize  it will give families an opportunity to rebuild equity in their homes  it will also give the mortgage industry the time   and incentive   to convert mortgages that were designed to fail into loans that actually can be repaid  third  the mortgage industry must provide status reports on the number of mortgages it is modifying  accountability is essential  despite all the media coverage  despite all the hearings  despite the secretary of the treasury  despite all that has gone on in the last   to   days  the mortgage industry has only modified about   percent of at risk mortgages this year  that' is simply not enough  now  i hope everyone will voluntarily agree to these steps  because we cannot fail at this  the costs are just too high  if we cannot reach a voluntary agreement  i will consider legislation to address the problem  mortgage servicers can work with borrowers to modify their mortgages  in the process  they can save families their homes  save investors from losses down the road  and help the economy  but this is unchartered territory for them  and many are worried about opening themselves up to lawsuits from the investors who actually own the loans  i'm prepared to consider giving legal protection to servicers and others who administer these loans and who do the right thing by balancing the interests of homeowners  the investors  and our economy  all of these proposals build on the work i've done throughout this year to urge immediate action on problems regarding housing  i've called on the mortgage industry to observe a  foreclosure timeout  i've put forward a plan to crack down on unscrupulous mortgage brokers  to end lending abuses  and expand the financial counseling programs that have been shown to reduce defaults and foreclosures  i've proposed that we allow the state housing finance agencies to issue tax exempt bonds to help families refinance their mortgages  on monday  the bush administration said it will give this idea a try  and i'm pleased to hear that  but i wish they'd done it when i proposed it two months   and more than   foreclosure notices ago  while we work to solve the immediate housing problem  i am also calling on the administration  the regulators  and the mortgage industry to ensure that the abuses of recent years don't happen again  we need an industry wide commitment to tightening underwriting standards and disclosure obligations  we need to vigorously enforce federal prohibitions against abusive lending practices  and we need to eliminate prepayment penalties  this has been one of the most heart breaking elements of this crisis  i did an event about this down in orlando  florida early last spring talking with a lot of homeowners who had gotten into sub prime mortgages  they fit the profile   many were first time homeowners  one got in trouble because he thought he was doing the right thing  his family and everyone told him   well as much money as you can save  pay off the loan as fast as possible  so he began putting more and more money aside to begin paying over what his mortgage payment was only to find out he had triggered the prepayment penalties and found himself with an increasing interest rate that forced him into foreclosure  we obviously need to clean up the standards and make all of the disclosures much more understandable to everyone but we do need to prosecute mortgage servicing fraud and foreclosure rescue fraud to the fullest extent of the law  and we certainly need to expand financial counseling for homeowners and buyers  what i'm proposing is a comprehensive  work out    not a  bail out    of our most pressing economic problem  and i do hope that many of you here and a lot of our leaders on wall street will join with me and others in helping to find these solutions  i was pleased that mayor bloomberg announced today a fund that will be a non profit fund along the lines that i've been advocating to help homeowners here in the city facing foreclosure  because addressing this issue with the right leadership and a commitment to shared responsibility will solve the problem  but let's remember that addressing the housing crises is only one piece of what has to become a broader agenda for creating shared prosperity for americans again  that's why i've put forward a package of middle class tax cuts that will help restore the basic american bargain  if you work hard you can get ahead   with dignified work  a college education  affordable health care  child care  savings and wealth creation  we need to change our tax code to reward middle class families and by doing so  we can get money into the pockets of tens of millions of people who will spend it  i also will extend middle class tax cuts  including the child tax credit  the marriage penalty relief  i want to give generous tax credits to help families afford health care  my plan called the american health choices plan includes health care tax credits so that individuals and small businesses will be able to afford health care through the congressional plan that i will open up to everyone  it's a really good plan  it's not government medicine  it is government administered and congress people love it  you get more than   choices at an average cost that is less than what you can find through your employer or in the market place  unfortunately it is limited to federal employees  by increasing the pool dramatically we will lower costs and be able to deal with some of the other cost drivers in the health care system  i'll also offer up to   in matching tax cuts to help families save for retirement  we also have a savings crisis  we have the lowest rate of savings since   and coincidentally we have the highest income inequality gap since   that was not a good year for america  so i think we need to be smart about how we're going to move forward together  i want to expand the earned income tax credit  increase the education tax cuts  it was interesting as i started traveling around the country last winter  i would be in small groups with my supporters and a lot of my wonderful donors  some of whom are here today  and i'd go through my list of what i wanted to do as president and i would say i wanted to increase college affordability and people would nod and they would be in obvious agreement but if i said it in a gymnasium in front of   people in concord  nh  they stood up and cheered and kicked the bleachers because it has become so expensive  we are shutting the door on college for a lot of worthy and motivated young people  i believe we should tie the minimum wage to congressional salaries  so that congress can't get a raise unless working men and women do too  we have to reform the alternative minimum tax  and i give congressman rangel a lot of points for courage in trying to take this on because it will increase the tax rates on millions of new york taxpayers and millions of others throughout america just at a time when we need stimulus so we've got to deal with the amt  it's a stealth tax that most people were never meant to pay  but  the growing concerns in our economy should prompt us to consider whether working families need more immediate assistance in the form of economic stimulus  just like the housing crisis  the administration has been asleep at the switch as overall economic conditions have worsened  we need a president who will wake up every morning focused on keeping our economy on track  and if we wake up to the current economic forecasts  a vigilant president should be talking about the right kind of stimulus today  and by right kind i mean broad based  we have  as my husband and i often say  certainly benefited over the last seven years of this administration as we've seen the vast majority of americans basically stall  so if we talk about stimulus lets talk about the right kind of stimulus  more and more economic forecasters and even just families across america worry we may face an economic set of issues that will stall growth even more  hit much harder on the income and the assets of people who are living in what i call the  trap door economy  right now   one pink slip  one missed mortgage payment  one medical diagnosis away from falling through and losing everything  that's why i have called for up to   billion in immediate assistance to help communities and distressed homeowners weather this foreclosure crisis  if we can help stabilize the patient we'll have a lot better chance of getting all of us healthy again  i've called for   billion in emergency energy assistance for families facing skyrocketing heating bills this winter  we need to be aggressive in getting this assistance out fast to working families and seniors so that they can spend it and protect themselves  these are initial steps and i believe we should be ready to take further steps if the situation deteriorates  we should do this in a way that makes economic common sense  in   president bush used stimulus as an excuse to force through long term tax cuts for the most fortunate among us  the result was a weak stimulus that continued us on a path to higher deficits  ballooning debt  and increased borrowing from foreign governments  this time around  let's make sure we get it right  let's make the stimulus temporary and not an excuse for long term fiscal recklessness  let's focus on hard working families  let's support them because they're the most likely to really provide what the economy desperately needs   a jumpstart  the administration was asleep at the switch but we can't wait until we have a new president  we need to make sure we do everything we can to get this president and this administration to take action  and we need then to have a president starting in january   who is ready to change our policies and lead our country  that means anticipating economic problems that may arise in the future and taking action to ameliorate or eliminate them  it means calling together immediately those who are stakeholders and decision makers  america is at its best when we work together  we haven't really been called to do that in the last seven years  many of us in new york waited to be called for some kind of commitment  sacrifice  responsibility after we were so horrifically attacked on   the call never came  i think it was a missed opportunity of historic proportion  what we need always to be ready to do is to respond as americans  we need to start acting as our best selves again  we need leadership who will summon us to do that  and i'm calling particularly on those who are so able and so smart and so resourceful to help us find our way forward here  don't wait for the administration or secretary paulson to call  call yourself  make sure that you're part of this ongoing  work out  it's the right thing to do for the economy  but even more importantly it's the right thing to do for america  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", "thank you all so much  it is such an honor to be here  back in council bluffs  with all of you  especially with friends like connie gronstal and her daughter kate and her husband mike  connie's a great leader of my campaign  both she and kate have been just devoted and working hard  i'm sure they've harassed a lot of you to be part of the team we're putting together  and i also am absolutely overwhelmed personally to have my friend of   years  bob kerrey  endorse me with such a vote of confidence  as connie said  bob has given a lifetime of service to our country  he has literally been on the front lines fighting and standing up and advocating for the values that we believe are really at the root of the american dream and this great country's journey toward progress  i also want to add  in addition to everything else that he has done  he served with great distinction on the   commission  that was especially important to those of us in new york  he tried to get to the truth  he tried to hold people and institutions accountable  bob and i have talked at length about what we need to do in america to make our country safe  to deter and defeat terrorism and to make our intelligence services as effective as possible  bob kerrey is the embodiment of patriotism in action  and it is a tremendous privilege for me to be here with him back across the river from nebraska where he served with distinction as he sets forth the reasons for his support of my candidacy  he knows something about courage and leadership  he's got some experience in tough fights  so i am thrilled to have him on my team  thank you so very much bob  we are kicking off today our  every county counts  tour right here in council bluffs  over the next five days  i and my friends and supporters will blanket iowa  we're going to be in all   counties  we're going to be knocking on doors and making phone calls  visiting people's homes  their places of work  all with a very simple but urgent message   the road to the white house for the next president begins here in iowa  iowans have an awesome responsibility  especially this year  because we have to make a decision that will not only help us figure out who will be the next democratic nominee  that's important  but even more so  who is ready to be president and who is ready  willing  and able on day one to do the job that we need done  so i'm excited about our  county blitz  i'm actually even going to get in a helicopter after i leave you  we're calling it a  hill a copter  and we're going to be able to cover more ground that way  but i have friends of a lifetime who have come to iowa to help me  including my best friend from elementary school with whom i am still very close  people i have worked with in arkansas  new york  across the country  and i am thrilled to introduce them to iowa and to have so many iowans hear their stories about why they would take time from their busy lives to come here on my behalf  i was especially honored by the endorsement this morning of my candidacy by the des moines register  it was an important event in this process  i am very grateful that they have zeroed in on the work that needs to be done by the next president  by my vision for our country  my plans for change  and my ability to lead  now with bob kerrey's endorsement  with congressman leonard boswell's endorsement of a few days ago  our campaign is energized  we're picking up momentum  and we're going all the way to january  rd with your help  i can feel the excitement growing and it really spans all ages  i was talking to an iowan on the phone as i was driving from the airport to come here and he told me that his daughter is turning   before the caucuses  they live in des moines  and she's going to caucus for me  then i got a report that a  year old man is also going to caucus for me  we are appealing to every generation  and that's the way it should be because we need everybody in america committed to the changes that we have to make together  it is inspiring to me that people in their  s and now in their second century will care enough about the future to say  you know what  no matter how inconvenient it is  how difficult it might be  regardless of the weather  i want to be there to stand up for hillary clinton  and young people whose whole lives are before them understanding what is at stake in this election  so i could not be more pumped up  i am thrilled at the vast and growing support we have across the state  but as bob kerrey said  we have to translate that into action on january  rd  and i want to make to you a case for my candidacy because as i also am reaching out and meeting with as many people as possible  and traveling all those miles  i have to rely on all of you the way i rely on connie and kate to be my eyes  my ears  really to speak for me  and i hope that you will impress upon people what a critical election this is  and that i am asking for your support based on my   years of work  my understanding of the changes that we need  my commitment to apply the persistence  the perseverance  and yes  the perspiration to get it done  because i understand very well what's happening in america today  i grew up in a middle class family outside of chicago  right here in the midwest  my father came home after serving in the navy for five years and he wanted to do three things  he wanted to start a small business  he wanted to start a family  and he wanted to save enough money to buy a house  my mother  who didn't have a very easy upbringing  she wanted to give her children she never had a chance to do and that was to go to college  so we lived the middle class values  we understood  as my parents taught me  that we had to work hard  be self reliant  be resilient  but also to be compassionate and caring  to be part of the larger community in order to give every american  particularly every child  a chance to live up to his or her god given potential  well my  year old mother  god bless her  still lives with me  i brought her out on the campaign trail as some of you may have seen from the media and she had such a great time that she decided she might do a little more of that if she had enough rest in between stops  but as we traveled around  it was a great reminder to me of the commitment i feel to making sure that those who are in the twilight of their years and those who are at the very dawn of their lives  all have a chance to pursue that american dream that has meant so much to all of us  and so i run for president because i know that there are a lot of families in america today  certainly here in iowa  whom i've met  they've been kind enough to share their stories and concerns with me  and their worries they feel anxious and insecure  they don't know whether life will be better for their children and their grandchildren  they ask themselves everyday   why is it no one seems to notice that i'm working as hard as i can and i'm not getting ahead  that i don't have health care for myself or my children  that my job has been outsourced and i don't know where i'm supposed to go to get another one  these are the real life concerns that iowans have shared with me over the past eleven months  i want to tell you that there will not be any invisible americans when i am president  everyone will be seen  respected  heard  and just as i'm saying that every county counts in my campaign  i want you to know that you'll be able to count on me when i am your president  i will get up every single day thinking about what i could do that day to make life a little easier  to make our country fairer  to restore shared prosperity and economic opportunity  to restore our moral authority around the world and to give americans back our pride in our country that we love so very much  after seven years of george bush  america is ready for change  we are ready for a new beginning  now it all comes down to one question  who is ready and able to make the changes we need starting on day one in the white house  audience  you are  well  some people believe you make change by demanding it  some people believe you make change by hoping for it  i believe you make change by working hard for it  that's what i've done all my life and that is what i will do for you  i know that's how you make real change in the lives of the real people that i know and care about  that i have fought for for   years  now that hard work demands that you know when to stand your ground and when to find common ground  if you're too unyielding  you won't get anything done  not in america  we're not a dictatorship  you have to work with other people  but if you don't stand up and refuse to compromise on what's important  then you could lose out the opportunity to make change  so you have to know how to balance it  how to stand your ground and how to find common ground  for   years i have been a change maker and that is exactly what i hope to do for all of you and for every american  now for me that means that i started when i got out of law school  not going to work for a big corporate law firm but going to work for the children's defense fund  and i did that because i watched and learned about my mother's life  the fact that she had to go to work as a mother's helper when she was   and it was hard  and i believe that kids should be given a better shot than that  and that a lot of kids draw the short straw in life  one of the first things i worked on was going door to door  trying to find out where missing children were  missing not because somebody had kidnapped them but missing because they weren't in school  back in the early  's you could look at census figures about the number of children who lived in a particular area  then you could look at school enrollment figures and there were children who were in the area who weren't in school and nobody could figure out why  and i found out why  i found children who were blind  children who were deaf  children in wheelchairs  children with other kinds of disabilities  there was no place for them in a beautiful school like this  so i worked with many others to change the law  to make it possible for children with disabilities to get a public education and i was proud to be part of making change that helped millions and millions of americans  in arkansas i worked to expand rural health care into some of the poorest places in the state  i worked to reform schools so if you were a poor child living in a really poor area of arkansas you often would go to a school that didn't have physics  it didn't have advanced mathematics  or chemistry  it didn't have foreign languages  so no matter how talented you were  no matter how hard working you were willing to be  you would never be able to compete for a first class education  so we changed that  we changed the standards  we improved education and independent observers said it was one of the best reforms in the country  because  you see  i knew that to make change you had to work with people  to raise teacher's salaries and to expand the curriculum  so thousands of arkansas students now have an education that was denied to previous generations and i am proud that i was part of making those changes as well  and as i continued to work  i chaired the legal services corporation to make sure that equal justice under law wasn't some cruel hoax in america  that if you were poor and you had a legitimate legal problem  you would have somebody who would give you your day in court  and i was very pleased that i could  in   work with a lot of very knowledgeable people to try to bring universal health care to our country  now we were not successful but i am very proud we tried because it was the right thing to do and now we are going to get it done when i become president again  i traveled to beijing as first lady on behalf of all of you  to stand up for a very simple proposition   that women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights  it's not only what we believe  here in our country  it's what we know is important for our national security  countries that deny women their rights are often countries that we have problems with  aren't they  so we've got to continue to stand up for american values and make sure those values are heard around the world  and when i am president i will continue to make the changes on behalf of women that are good and right for women and smart for american security  i wrote a book called  it takes a village  because that's what i believe  about how we can build a better country for our children  i was pleased to turn all of the proceeds from that book   over a million dollars   to children's charities  because it's not only what we do in our government that counts  it's what we do in our daily lives  how we support charitable enterprises that are there with a helping hand for people that need it  and i want  as president  to inspire more philanthropy  to get more americans involved in helping their neighbors  there's more than enough work to do  and we want to harness what is really the genius of our country   the willingness of our citizens to give of themselves  when we weren't successful with health care for everyone  i did not give up  i sometimes think you can tell more about a person when you see what they do after they don't succeed than if they have already succeeded  because we want people who pull themselves up  don't we  who get up after being knocked down and keep going  and that is what i did when i helped to create the children's health insurance program and we have seen that program over the last   years expand health care to millions of kids and now george bush has vetoed our efforts to expand it  well  i'll tell you  when i become president  we're going to expand health care for every single american child  in the senate  i have worked across the aisle to make change  when i was elected  the people of new york took a chance on me and it was a great honor that they did  but i knew that i had to go and get things done  i couldn't just say  'we'll i've been elected  thank you very much ' that's not who i am that's not what i do  so i immediately went to work  expanding economic opportunities in our rural areas for our farmers in our small towns  working across the aisle with republicans to get health care for our national guard and reserve members who didn't have it  working to make sure we had a national emergency system so that when you hit   on your cell phone  somebody would know where you were  working to make sure that despite the differences we have in philosophy or ideology  that we cannot let partisanship stand in the way of improving the lives of the people in our country  i look forward to working with republicans  as well as democrats and independents  to create a new beginning for america  that new beginning will once and for all give us universal health care  everyday people come up to me with their problems  they tell me horror stories about insurance companies that reject their claims  about premiums going up so fast and high they can't possibly keep insurance for themselves and their families  about being without insurance  not able to afford the prescription drugs and the treatment that their doctors say are needed  i listen to so many of these stories and it just strengthens my resolve that we will put together a great coalition of business and labor  of doctors and nurses and health care professionals and together we will take on the health insurance companies and the drug companies  and we're going to be successful this time  the stories that i hear  the personal acquaintances and friends that i have convince me that nothing other than health care for everyone should be the standard  when i was working on my health care plan there were those who said  but that's controversial  that's politically risky  why don't you just cut yourself a little slack here  it's not going to hurt to leave people out   that's a better political case to make  i said  who should i leave out  who gets to choose who is left out  should i leave out people like dawn carstens and her husband greg from webster city  they run their own auto body shop  they work really long hours every single day but they can't afford insurance  should i tell them just to roll the dice  should i leave out ellen duffy  a nurse i met in waterloo diagnosed with breast cancer  her treatments made her so sick she couldn't possibly continue to work and when she finally recovered and tried to go back to work the hospital told her she no longer had a job  she lost her health insurance  who should i leave out  i don't want to leave anybody out  i am not running for president to put band aids on this problem  i am running for president to solve it  and i need your help to make that case  we'll make a new beginning for our seniors  we're going to provide retirement security for working americans  we're going to provide long term care  i will go after those insurance companies that swindle seniors out of their money  sometimes out of their life savings  i will go after those nursing homes that abuse our seniors  we're going to have more home health aid  we're going to have more dignified and respectable alternatives  i want to provide a   tax credit for caregivers who do the hard work of caring for not only aging family members but children with disabilities  this is a labor of love  it's one of the most important jobs any of us will ever do and i don't think people should be penalized for it  i was in winterset two weeks or so ago and there was a man there and a woman in a wheelchair and the man was standing behind her with his hands on the back of the wheelchair  occasionally he would reach over and give her a drink  occasionally wipe her mouth  and i called on him when question time came  he told me that he and his wife had been married for   years  that she's had parkinson's for   years and it got increasingly more difficult to care for her  he tried to get long term care insurance  nobody would help him with his wife  all he's looking for is a little bit of help  he wants to take care of her  they've been together a really long time  but it's going to be hard if he doesn't get help at all  when i'm president we're going to provide help to loving family members like him and so many others who are doing the right thing  we're also going to get a new beginning on energy independence and combating global warming  this is a security issue  we cannot continue to be dependent on foreign oil  this is the most important environmental issue  aren't you proud of al gore getting the nobel peace prize for his work on global warming  well  we need to translate that incredible commitment that he and many others have made to action  so i have a plan to do that  to move toward homegrown energy just like we're doing here in iowa with biofuels and wind  promote more energy efficiency  i want to applaud the democratic congress  we've raised gas mileage standards for the first time in decades  so there's enough work for us to do to protect our planet  to protect our economy and to protect our security  and you know what the good news is  if we do this we'll create millions of new good jobs right here in iowa and across our country  we'll make a new beginning for our economy  we're going to rebuild our great american middle class  we're going to support our unions  we're going to give people the right to organize and bargain collectively  we're going to give tax cuts to the people who need them  not the people who don't  and we're going to change our tax codes so we don't give incentives to those who outsource jobs and we're finally going to move toward trade agreements that do have labor and environmental standards so it's not a race to the bottom but a real move of lift to the top  we're going to move back to fiscal responsibility  something that bob kerrey when he was senator had an instrumental role in making possible  and look at what has happened  under this president  all of that hard work has been squandered  well we're going to get back to reclaiming our future by stopping the mortgaging of our country and having us borrow billions and billions of dollars from countries like china and mexico and every place in between  and we'll make a new beginning on education  we're going to provide early childhood education  something that connie has worked on her entire professional life  we need to build stronger families  we need to have more early intervention  we need to help parents know what they need to do in order to help their own children  this is something i have worked on for decades  i brought a program to arkansas  the home instruction for preschool youngsters program  that gave parents the tools they needed to help their own children  because that's the best way for us to really make a difference in a child's life  and then we'll have a universal pre kindergarten program that reaches those kids particularly who are disadvantaged to give them even more help and support  and we're going to end the unfunded mandate known as no child left behind  and i have pledged to make college affordable again for every young person who goes and is motivated  we're not going to forget those young people who don't go to college  how about more job training  more apprenticeship programs  let's give them the kind of help that they deserve to have for a good job and a good future  we'll make a new beginning in reforming our government  i'm going to end the cronyism and the no bid contracts for halliburton  we're going to end the kind of war on science that the bush administration has waged  it's time we start actually investing in science again  so how about lifting the ban on stem cell research  and how about making america the innovation nation again  we can create so much if we have a partnership between levels of government and the public and the private system  and i have the idea i've been promoting all across iowa  how about appointing qualified people to the government again after the bush administration  finally we will make a new beginning to restore america's leadership in the world  it will start with ending the war in iraq and bringing our troops home as quickly and responsibly as we can  and when i am president  there will be a very simple message that goes out across the world   the era of cowboy diplomacy is over  we're going to start working with people again  but i can't do any of this without you  i'm going to work as hard as i can to earn your support and your trust  and i need every one who is ready for change to go to the caucuses on january  rd  if you can't afford health care  you're tired of paying through the roof for your gas every time you try to fill up your car or your truck  you're tired of seeing the economy tilt more and more toward the already wealthy and privileged   if you think it is time to make sure we have no invisible americans  then i need you to stand up and caucus for me  if you can't bear to see our young men and women  our sons and our daughters  continuing to fight another country's civil war  if you believe that the best way to support our troops is to bring them home   but you want to be sure it's done the right way   then i need you to stand and caucus for me  if you want to get our country back into the solutions business  if you believe our future can be better than our present or our past  if you want to feel that pride again in america  then i need you to go stand up and caucus for me  because if you will go and do that on january  rd  i promise you i will stand and wage a winning campaign for our values and our principles and then when i am elected  i will stand and fight for each and every one of you every single day  let's make history together  thank you all very  very much "], ["clinton", "thank you so much  i think the best thing for me to do is just say thank you very much  i am very grateful to so many of you for coming out this morning and being part of this event here in johnston  it is very exciting for me to have so many of my friends from my entire life who have come out here to talk with iowans  to answer questions  to give you some insight and information about our relationships  about what i've been trying to do for my entire life and particularly as an adult  there are so many people who feel invisible right now  they feel like nobody is listening  they don't have health care for themselves and their families and they don't know what they are going to do  or they have just been told their job is going to be moved overseas and they are not quite sure how they are going to keep going  or they are counting pennies at the table trying to make sure that they can pay to fill the tank in their car or their truck  i think it's one of the most important jobs of a president  of anybody in public life because it is such a public trust  to really listen and to reach out and to learn and to work as hard as you can to make a difference  to try to help people who are doing the best they can  but sometimes life has a way of hitting you upside the head  i was listening to my friends talk and i was thinking about each one of them  bonnie campbell  who's been a leader here in iowa and did just wonderful work for our country when she was in the justice department during my husband's presidency  i think about her with her husband ed  and how devoted she is to him and how caring she is in making sure that he is always taken care of and included  that kind of sums up the way we all live  we are not all the same in every setting we find ourselves  are we  when you're with your family  you're going to be a little bit different than when you're at work  when you're at work  you're going to be a little bit different than when you're at the mall  that all adds up to the people we are  every time i think of bonnie campbell  i think about the work she's done for those who will never know her name and all she's done for people who are very close and personal to her  i'm very proud that she's my friend  jeff volk is someone who came into my life because of what happened to his family down in new orleans during hurricane katrina  i was grateful that we were able to give him some help  some advice  some information when he was  as any person would be  worried about his family  when i met him he started out by saying 'i'm a conservative republican ' i said 'well  that's ok  my dad was a conservative republican  but he evolved ' i have gotten to know jeff and his family and i am so grateful for his support  it means a lot to me to have someone who knows we've got to cross party lines  that what's most important is that instead of acting like democrats or republicans  we start acting like americans again and roll up our sleeves and solve our problems together   applause  i so appreciate shannon coming all this way because she has a very demanding life and her wonderful daughter is getting such love and attention from a mom who adores her  who does everything she can for her  i've met a lot of moms like shannon over many years  who don't know where to turn  i've met a lot of dads who can't figure out how they are supposed to take care of the person they love the most  a child who's been stricken with an illness maybe they've never heard of  or had an accident  and now needs so much care  these are people that i think every one of us can relate to  whether anything tragic and bad has happened to us personally  we know people who have faced the same dilemma that shannon and her family faced  i believe i have a great honor and a privilege to be in public office  what i try to do everyday is figure out how to help somebody  you can't always pass the laws you want to pass right away  you can't snap your fingers and get people to cooperate  you have to work on that every minute of every day  but you can try to help somebody every single day  i have tried to do that as a public servant  as an activist  and now as a senator and that's what i will do as president  because i want to help those people like shannon and so many others who deserve our help  my friend besty  whom i met in  th grade   in mrs  king's class   has been with me through thick and thin  that's not just a reflection on how we look today  about the good times and the not so good times  we both have to do better on the other part  in junior high and high school  i wore really thick glasses  which i really hated  there was always some boy or another that i was hoping would notice me  so i used to take them off and that meant i did not know where i was going  betsy would arrange to meet me so that we could walk down the hallway together so i would not bump into a locker  but also so she could say  'don is on the right ' i could say  'hi  don ' like i actually did see him  she's been guiding me around ever since  i'm so pleased she could be here  she and her family are very important to mine  each one of us could tell stories like this  about the people who you know and the people who know you  here in iowa  i want you to have some flavor of who i am outside of the television cameras   when all of the cameras and the lights disappear  what i do when nobody's listening or taking notes  and recording it  because it is hard when you're in public life to have that kind of sharing experience with thousands and millions of people on our  county blitz  which we started yesterday  i'm going to get to as many places as i can  but so are my friends  and people whom i've worked with  and for  over a lifetime  i think this election is one of the most important that we've ever had  there's a big responsibility facing iowans because you get to make the first choice  not just the country  but the world will be watching  we all know that we need new leadership  but it's not just changing who lives in the white house  it's having a president who is ready to lead to make the changes that all of us know are necessary  i've been making change my entire life  for   years as an adult  i've worked to try to help kids with disabilities get into public schools back in the early  s when i worked for the children's defense fund  i worked in arkansas to expand health care and education  and i have friends from arkansas who are here today who have been dear friends to me  i know what a difference it makes when people are really committed to trying to expand opportunity beyond where it is to what it can be  i was privileged to spend those eight years in the white house as part of the team around my husband  and to work on expanding health care to every american   quality  affordable health care  that's a hard job  lots of people have tried   harry truman  even richard nixon   because it's the right thing to do and it's the smart decision for us to make as a nation  but we weren't successful that first time  but i think you actually learn more about people when they may not be successful than if they just slope through life  i had a choice  i could have said 'ok  we didn't do it  i'm not trying anymore ' or  what i decided to do was to say 'ok  we didn't do it  let's regroup and see what we can get done ' that's why i worked to make sure that all our children were immunized  and that drug companies were required to test drugs before they gave them to children  then i went to work to help create the children's health insurance program and now   million children have health care who wouldn't have had it otherwise we're trying to overcome the president's vetoes of giving health care to even more children  in the senate i have worked across party lines and i have done that in order to get work done that would help people  betsy was kidding about the way i immerse myself in all of the issues affecting new yorkers including dairy farmers  our fruit and vegetable farmers  and so many else  for me it is about getting up every day and working as hard as you can so that when we found out the national guard and reserves didn't have health care  i teamed up with a republican senator  lindsay graham of south carolina  over the opposition of the pentagon and the opposition of the white house  we passed health care for guard and reserve members  like so many who have left here from iowa  when we saw that our young men and women were coming back from iraq with something that was being called traumatic brain injury and realized that nobody was paying attention  i went to work  i wrote and helped to pass the first legislation that addressed the traumatic brain injury problem  when we started hearing about how families   when they had an injured son or daughter coming back from war  they couldn't take enough time off from work without losing their job to be there by the side of their son or daughter   i teamed up with chris dodd and republicans and we passed an extension of the family leave act so if you're son or your daughter is injured  you don't have to worry about losing your job  you are protected  you can be there during that most important period  these are real problems that real americans face  there's nothing abstract about it  it's what i hear about every single day  everybody talks about change in this election  people have different ideas about how to bring about change  some people believe you can get change by demanding it  some people believe you can get change by hoping for it  i believe the way you get change is by working hard for it  persistence  perseverance  even some perspiration   that is how you change lives  you change institutions  that is what i have done my whole life  that is what i will do as your president  because i intend to give america a new beginning  the whole world will breathe a sigh of relief when george bush leaves the white house   applause  and then we do have to get to work  don't we  we need a new beginning in health care  i have proposed a plan  the american health choices plan that will provide quality affordable health care for everyone  and here's how it will work  if you have health insurance and you're happy with it  nothing changes  but if you don't have health insurance or if the health insurance you have doesn't cover what's called a preexisting condition  you're a diabetic and it won't cover your diabetes  you have a heart condition and it won't cover your heart condition  so it's really not insuring you for what you need most  it's too expensive  you will be able to have new choices  i want to open up the congressional plan to every american  it's a good plan  over   choices  private insurance company choices that you can decide how best suits you at an average cost below what you can get through an employer or in the private marketplace  every federal employee has access to this plan and you pay for it because you pay the bulk of it  because it is paid for out of tax dollars   about   of it  i figure if it's good enough for members of congress  it's good enough for every american to have those same choices at the same affordable cost  we're going to help people who have a little trouble affording it with health care tax credits  we're going to emphasize prevention because we're now not paying for prevention and therefore we pay more when somebody gets really sick  we're going to emphasize chronic care management  we're going to take better care of people who are chronically ill  we're going to have electronic medical records  something i worked on with newt gingrich and bill frist which raised some eyebrows in washington  i believe we can move toward a health care system that covers everyone  that decreases costs for everyone  and improves quality for everyone  when i was finalizing my health care plan  there were a lot of people who said to me  'you know trying to cover everybody is controversial  it's going to engender all of the usual talking points from the other side  so you really shouldn't start being so ambitious  i asked people  'in other words  you want me to leave out millions of people from my health care plan ' well ok  who do we leave out  do we leave out shannon's daughter  isabella  people say that she has a deteriorating condition   maybe we just leave her out of health care  do we leave out the young couple i met in webster city who own an auto body shop  they can't afford insurance for themselves and their kid  they're working as hard as they can  maybe we should just leave them out and hope they stay healthy  or maybe i should leave the nurse out from waterloo i met  who was diagnosed with breast cancer  the treatment made her really sick  she couldn't go to work  by the time she got back to work  she found out she didn't have a job anymore  when she lost her job  she lost her health care  maybe we should leave her out  i don't want to leave anybody out  i am not running for president to put band aids on our problems  i want to solve our problems  once and for all and i want to start by setting forth a plan that will do that   applause  maybe we can get a new beginning in energy and global warming  this is an area that we have to act on  we cannot continue to be held hostage to those who produce oil  they've got us over a barrel  the oil barrel  that barrel is now about   a barrel  it was   when george bush became president  now we are spending more and more money sending it to countries that often turn around and use that money against us  i think we can do a lot better  i have proposed a comprehensive energy plan that will be good for our security  that will be good for our environment because we do have to deal with the greenhouse gas emissions in our atmosphere  and that will be good for our economy  i believe if you just follow the example of iowa  and what has been done here with bio fuels and wind  we will create millions of new good jobs across america  these are jobs that can't be outsourced  these are jobs that will be done right here in iowa and right here in our nation  that's the kind of energy future that i'm convinced we have  we should treat this like the apollo moon shot  when i was a little girl  that lifted our sights and it also created a lot of jobs and a lot of spinoff  the internet actually came out of research that was done on the space program  who knows what we will invent if we get serious about energy and global warming  let's unleash the innovative genius of america again  there isn't anything we can't do if we put our minds to it   applause  i want a new beginning in education  education begins in the family and we've got to do more to help families get the tools and resources they need to take care of their own children  that's also work that i've done a very long time  going back to my earliest years when through my church  i was involved in all kinds of activities affecting small children that had some difficulties  that had some disadvantages to overcome  i want to do more to help families  i want to have a universal pre kindergarten program  again   like what you are doing here in iowa to help every child  especially from disadvantaged backgrounds get better prepared  and i want to end the unfunded mandate of no child left behind which has interfered with learning and teaching   applause  we have to start reimagining education  it's the  st century  i go into classrooms across america  i was in a school in iowa here about two weeks ago and there was a lot going on that was different and new and there were computers  but the classrooms looked pretty much the same as they looked when i was there with betsy back in  th grade  let's start thinking about how we are going to tailor instruction more to meet individual children's needs because every child learns differently  i think we've got to do more to help give each child a chance to live up to his or her god given potential  i want to be a president who will actually work with teachers  and work with others who care about improving education the right way  and then we've got to make college affordable for middle class and working families  let's make it easier for those kids who want to go to school   i meet them all over iowa   who say they don't know how they're going to afford it  they have to go into such deep debt  i want every young person who is willing to work hard to go to college to be able to afford to do that  i also don't want to forget that the majority of our kids will not go to college  let's start taking care of the young men and women who do the hard work that keeps the economy going  who fight our wars  who take care of us  who protect us   applause  education is still the passport to opportunity and we need to stamp that passport   st century  and start making it work again  we need a new beginning when it comes to reforming our government  no more no bid contracts  and cronyism  and corruption  and incompetence  and insensitivity  every one of us is a customer of the federal government  i sure don't think we've been getting very good customer service the last seven years  we can do so much better  what i want to do is make sure the government works for everybody  not just for the privileged and the connected  there is a lot of work to be done here  but we're going to start with a very simple proposition   how about electing qualified people for the jobs we ask them to hold in the united states government again  people who know what they're supposed to do  are committed to doing it  and can deliver results  we're going to have a new beginning to america's leadership in the world  we're going to start with ending the war in iraq and bringing our troops home as quickly and responsibly as we possibly can  we're going to do some other things as well  we're going to thank those young men and women who have served their country because they have done everything they were asked to do   applause  but there is no military solution  we should not permit them to continue to serve as referees of the iraqi civil war  it is up to the iraqis to take responsibility for their own country and when i am president  they will have to do just that   applause  when our troops come home  we have to take care of them  a lot will be needing health care  they have been injured and wounded  some of it visible  they've lost arms and legs  they've been blinded  some of it is not so visible  it's the traumatic brain injury  it's the post traumatic stress disorder  a few months ago i was at walter reade visiting with soldiers who had come back from iraq and afghanistan and i met a very handsome young army captain  who had lost his right arm in baghdad and lost the ring finger on his left hand when his wedding ring melted into his finger  i said  'captain  how are you doing  how's it coming for you ' he says  'you know  i'm learning how to use the prosthetic  i'm figuring it out  they're really helpful  they're teaching me what to do ' and then he said  'but where do i go to get my brain back ' because those explosive devices  that kill and maim so many of our young men and women  also produce a concussive effect  a physical shaking of the brain  he said  'i went to west point  i never had anybody take care of me  now my wife has to give me a list every morning of what i have to do  of what i do next  of what i do then ' so i worked to get legislation passed to begin to deal with these issues  i will pledge to you that i will be a president who takes care of our veterans  i think it is disgraceful that we have people waiting months for appointments  they can't get their disability claims processed  the president doesn't seem to either know or evidence any concern  when i'm president  veterans are going to get the highest priority treatment   and not just those who are coming back from iraq and afghanistan  but all our veterans  particularly from my own generation who served in vietnam  who never got the welcome and the help that they deserved to have   applause  we can have a new beginning in america  but i can't do any of this  and all of the other issues and concerns that i've talked about in my campaign  without your help  on january  rd you have a big decision  i was thrilled and honored to get the endorsement of the des moines register  they put us through our  inaudible   applause  i have never seen a more grueling process  they not only interviewed   of us once  they interviewed   of us twice  plus they did research  plus they asked probing questions in other settings where they really were taking our measure  i was in dunlap yesterday at a sale barn  a livestock salebarn  i've been in sale barns often  particularly in arkansas  i was standing up where they show the cattle and i said 'i've never been in this position'  but that's the way i felt  i thought ok  you want to look inside my mouth  alright  have at it ' but at the end of that process they made the case for my candidacy  we have good people running  everybody brings different experiences  qualifications  different ideas about what they want to do  but the register said what i believe   that we don't have a minute to waste  we don't have a margin for error  we'll always make mistakes  we're human beings  but we've got to go for proven leadership  that's been tested  that is ready on day one  i offer that to the people of iowa for these caucuses  i hope you will decide to go and stand up for me in your caucus  i'm so excited by the growing energy and enthusiasm and people coming on board from across the state  one day i met a   year old who was just about to turn   who is going to caucus for me and i heard about a  year old man who is determined to go to the caucuses and has made his  year old son promise to take him  i'm asking you to stand up for me for one night and i will stand up for you throughout this campaign  standing up for our values  our principles  for the kind of change we need to bring the country together just as i did in new york  then i will stand up every single day in the white house  i will be thinking about you  and about your family  about your job  and your health care  i will be thinking about how to restore our leadership and our moral authority around the world  and together we will not only make history  but we will once again feel pride and progress in the country we love  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", "thank you so much  we're going to take this enthusiasm and go right to new hampshire tonight  this is a great night for democrats  we have seen an unprecedented turnout here in iowa and that is good news because today we're sending a clear message   that we are going to have change and that change will be a democratic president in the white house in   i am so proud to have run with such exceptional candidates  i congratulate senator obama and senator edwards  i thank senator dodd and senator biden and governor richardson and congressman kucinich  together we have presented the case for change and have made it absolutely clear that america needs a new beginning  i am as ready as i can be after having had this incredible experience here in iowa  starting out a long time ago and making this journey with so many people who have become my friends and who i am so grateful for their hard work and support   those from iowa  those who have come from around the country  and the people who were there exceeding anybody's expectations about what it would mean to have the caucuses this year  i thank you  i thank each and every one of you for coming out and standing up for a democrat  what is most important now is that as we go on with this contest that we keep focused on the two big issues  that we answer correctly the questions that each of us has posed  how will we win in november   by nominating a candidate who will be able to go the distance and who will be the best president on day one  i am ready for that contest  we have always planned to run a national campaign all the way through the early contests because i want the people of america  and particularly democrats and like minded independents and republicans who have seen the light to understand   number one   that the stakes are huge  that the job is enormous  but that i believe we're going to make the right decision  there will be a lot of people who will get involved as they have here in iowa   of all ages  that is what we want because we're not just trying to elect a president  we're trying to change our country  that is what i am committed to doing  i have set big goals for our country  i want to rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class and to me  that is the most important job the next president will have here at home  because if we don't begin to pay attention to the people who do the work and raise the families and make this country great  we will not recognize america in a few years  i want to make it absolutely clear i intend to restore america's leadership and our moral authority in the world and we're going to tackle all of the problems that are going to be inherited because of the current administration  including ending the war in iraq and bringing our troops home and then giving them the support that they need  we're going to reform our government  we're going to make sure that it is not the government of the few  by the few  and for the few  but it actually works for every american again  and we're going to reclaim the future for our children  i have done this work for   years  it is the work of my lifetime  i have been involved in making it possible for young people to have a better education and for people of all ages to have health care and that transforming work is what we desperately need in our country again  i am so ready for the rest of this campaign and i am so ready to lead  if you're concerned about whether or not we can have quality affordable health care for every american  then i'm your candidate  and if you're concerned about whether we can have an energy policy that will break the shackles of our dependence on foreign oil and set forth a new set of goals for us to meet together  then i'm your candidate  and if you are worried about  once and for all  taking on global warming  making it clear that we will end the unfunded mandate known as no child left behind  that we will make college affordable again  that we will be  once again  the country of values and ideals that we cherish so much  then please join me in this campaign  we have a long way to go but i am confident and optimistic  both about the campaign but maybe more importantly about our country  this country deserves everything we can give to it  there were a lot of people who couldn't caucus tonight despite the very large turnout  there are a lot of iowans who are in the military  they were in iraq or afghanistan or somewhere else serving our country and they need a commander in chief who respects them and who understands that force should be only used as a last resort  not a first resort  there are a lot of people who work at night  people who are on their feet  people who are taking care of patients in a hospital or waiting on a table in a restaurant or maybe in a patrol car keeping our streets safe and they need a president who is going to care about them and their families  i wrote a book some years ago called  it takes a village to raise a child  and in it i have a chapter that i titled  every child needs a champion  i think that the american people need a president who is their champion and that is what i intend to be  i want to thank all the people who have been part of this campaign so far  i especially want to thank all of my friends here in iowa who have worked so hard  i want to thank those who have come from across america  i want to thank all of the unions  the more than six million union members who support my candidacy  i know that we are going to get up tomorrow and keep pushing as hard as we can to get the message out about what is at stake in this election because we know that it is literally the future of our country  thank you all so very much for caring enough to be involved in politics  for giving of your time and your resources  for understanding that this great democracy of ours deserves to have all of our best efforts and i promise you  this campaign that i am running will certainly have mine and i ask for yours as well  thank you all very  very much  god bless you "], ["clinton", "thank you  new hampshire  thank you so very much  new hampshire  how are you tonight  are you ready to pick a president  are you ready for universal health care for every single man  woman and child  are you ready for an economy that works again for every american  not just the few and the wealthy and the well connected  are you ready to stop the war in iraq and bring our troops home and to take care of them when they come home  well  if you are ready  then we have to pick a president starting this tuesday who is committed to making the changes that america deserves  it is time for us  as democrats  to make our voices heard across our country that we know our country can do better and we want to be part of the change that is waiting to happen  i am so happy to be here in new hampshire  a place that i have come now for over   years  i have learned a lot in new hampshire  i have learned the importance that you place on elections because you understand that it is not about those of us who are running  it is about you  it is about all of those who need a champion  years ago i wrote a book called   it takes a village  there are a lot of beautiful villages in new hampshire  in it i had a chapter titled   every child needs a champion  it is time for the american people to have a champion for a president again who looks after us  takes care of business here at home  i know that everybody wants change  some people think you make change by demanding it  some people think you make change by hoping for it  i think you make change by working really  really hard and bringing people together to create the change that we need  that is what i have been doing for more than   years  i intend to take all of that experience making positive change and put it to work for you  america needs a new beginning  we need to once again believe in ourselves  have pride in our country  make progress together  i know that we are up to the job  there are many reasons why history will judge george bush harshly  among the two are the way that he has used fear to divide us  he has governed by it and he has undermined that sense of accomplishment and progress that has been at the heart of the american dream  and the other reason is because we have been infected by a sense of fatalism  we can't solve our problems like fixing the economy and health care  instead  we're told that we should not even try  since when did america become the can't do nation  i do not believe that is who we are  i know that is not who new hampshire is  together  we are going to take back our birthright  we are going to have the confidence and optimism to start rolling up our sleeves and solving our problems again  that will begin with once again restoring and rebuilding the american middle class  it deserves a president who will finally deliver on health care  something i have committed myself to for many years now  why  because i cannot bear that there   million uninsured americans and millions more who are denied health coverage even though they have insurance  i have proposed a plan i think is not only going to get the job done to cover every american  but is politically doable  it will bring together business  labor  doctors  nurses  hospitals  we will open up the congressional health plan  congress has a good plan for itself  it is time that everybody had the same health care that congress provides for itself and federal employees  we need to be sure this is comprehensive health care  we will cover mental health and end the stigma that is too often still associated with mental health treatment  there are some who say we can't cover everyone  it's too politically ambitious  it's controversial  they offer instead virtual health care  i believe we have to cover everyone and i am not going to leave anyone out  i would not know who to leave out  would i leave out the woman whose son has had four heart surgeries already  and facing so many more years of poor health and challenge  would i leave out the young couple from manchester who have their own business who i met door knocking and are wondering if they will be able to afford health care for themselves and their children  i am not running for president to put band aids on our problems  i am running for president to solve our problems  starting with health care  we need a new beginning when it comes to the economy  we are in troubled waters in the american economy  today  it was announced that we've had the worst three days to start any year since   we had an unemployment figure which confirmed our fears that unemployment is rising  we need a president who will exercise the kind of economic stewardship that americans deserves  we need an economy that is creating prosperity for everyone  we need jobs for those were willing to work hard and take responsibility  i will be a president who once again pays attention to the american middle class  not to the wealthy and the well connected who have done extremely well for themselves under george w  bush  we are going to create millions of new  good jobs starting with making energy our highest priority  making it clear that we will no longer be dependent on foreign oil  we will enhance our security  we will deal with global warming and we will create millions of new good jobs that cannot be outsourced  if we do this  it will be the equivalent of the apollo moon shot  this is up to this generation but you need a president who will lead and will clear away the special interest from the oil companies to the oil producing countries  and once again provide the kind of enthusiastic embrace of a problem america is equipped to solve  we need a new beginning when it comes to education starting with universal pre  kindergarten  ending the unfunded mandate known as no child left behind that has interfered with teaching and learning in our schools  making college affordable and yes  paying more attention to the young people who don't go to college  giving them the opportunities to pursue the american dream  we need to reform our government  it is time that we ended the cronyism and the no bid contracts  that we said once and for all how about appointing qualified people for the positions we ask them to hold in the federal government again  we need a new beginning to restore our international leadership and our moral authority  it starts with ending the war in iraq and bringing our troops home  i have said that as soon as i'm inaugurated  i will have the joint chiefs  the secretary of defense  and my security advisers draw up the plans necessary to begin withdrawing our troops within   days  because i know that the bush administration has not planned because they do not intend to withdraw  it is dangerous to withdraw troops  it is dangerous to take out our convoys with our men and women and our equipment down those same corridors that have been the subject of so many attacks  so many deaths  so many injuries  it's also important that we think about the civilians  american citizens  who are working for the embassy  working for companies  working for not for profit agencies  they have to come out  too  it would be dishonorable for us to turn our backs on those iraqis who helped us  who were the translators and the drivers who put their own lives at risk in order to save the lives of americans and iraqis  i will make it clear to the iraqi government that the blank check that george bush gave them is no longer valid  they have to take responsibility for their own future  when we bring our troops home  let's take care of them  they have not been given the health care  the compensation  and the support that they so richly have earned  there is a lot of work to be done  it will start on january     when the next president walks into the oval office  all of these challenges will be waiting  but so will opportunities   opportunities to preserve our liberty and create new possibilities for americans  particularly young americans  and also to keep us moving towards a more perfect union  i know that the next president will embody the hopes and dreams of all of us  i also know that they cannot be false hopes  we have to pick a president who is ready on day one to do the job   the tough  difficult job that will await  there are two big questions for voters in new hampshire  one is who will be the best president on day one  the second is who can we nominate who will go the distance against the republicans  the republicans are not going to give up the white house without a fight  now they should  they should basically say  we are ashamed of what we have done to our country for the last seven years  but i don't think that is what we will hear from them  and i know  having been on the receiving end of all the incoming fire  that they train on democrats   now for   years   that much to their dismay  i am still here  i am still standing  and i am still fighting for you  so here is what i will do for the next days  this election is about all of you here tonight and the thousands more who can't be here  when you go to vote on tuesday  you are voting not only your own interests  your own needs  your own values  but the rest of america and the world will be watching as well  this election is not only about our country  it is about whether we can restore america's position  whether we can find common ground  i have been making change for   years  in the years in the senate  i have found a lot of common ground with republicans  wherever we could  we have worked together to bring respite care to caregivers and health care to national guard and reserve members  but i also know how to stand my ground  i have stood against george bush's medicare prescription drug benefit for the drug companies and the insurance companies  i have stood against his proposal to privatize social security  something that will never happen as long as i have anything to say about it  i know that we've got to bring people together to the divide that too often separates americans  we also have to stand for democratic principles  i am proud to be a democrat  i am proud to be a member of the longest lasting political party in the world  i am proud

moment of so many big challenges  we know we face challenges here at home  around the world  so many challenges for the people whose lives i've been privileged to be part of  i've met families in this state and all over our country who have lost their homes to foreclosures  men and women who work day and night but can't pay the bills and hope they don't get sick because they can't afford health insurance  young people who can't afford to go to college to pursue their dreams  too many have been invisible for too long  well  you are not invisible to me  the oil companies  the drug companies  the health insurance companies  the predatory student loan companies have had seven years of a president who stands up for them  it's time we had a president who stands up for all of you  i intend to be that president  to be a president who puts you first   your lives  your families  your children  your future  i believe deeply in america  in our can do spirit  in our ability to meet any challenge and solve any problem  i believe in what we can do together  in the future  we will build together  there will be no more invisible americans  so we're going to take what we've learned here in new hampshire  and we're going to rally on and make our case  we are in it for the long run  and that is because we are in it for the american people  this victory will serve notice that people across our

their minds and i really appreciate it  finally  i want to say how much i respect our democratic candidates  senators dodd and biden who were in the race earlier have given great service to our

millions of people who believe  as i do  that this country is worth fighting for  thank you  and god bless you "], ["clinton", "thank you  thank you so much  i am absolutely thrilled to be here  i say all the time that this election is about the future so thought i would come to where the future is actually happening   right here  i want to thank marvin krobke for not only welcoming us here but for getting me a few minutes with the people who are doing the training to create these new jobs of the future  i am so excited that what is happening here can be a model for what we must do around america  thank you so much  marvin  i want to thank my friends who are here with me  i appreciate very much the strong statement of endorsement from john garamendi  he has been a friend  he and his wife patti served not only california but america and i'm grateful to him  i want also to thank the speaker   i'm amazed at all the work that is being done in a bipartisan way here in california to set the future in motion on the environment and health care  fabian nu ez  thank you so much  i appreciate so much my friend and sister  your congresswoman who has been a stalwart champion of all those who she represents and she understands that it's imperative that we have an economy that works for everyone  that we take care of people who get up everyday and do the very best they can  so lucille  thank you  thank you for your leadership  congresswoman roybal allard  and i was so grateful to have the mayor's help during times in the cold and the snow  every time i saw him he was on fire  which he needed to be because he was shivering half the time  but he got out there and made the case for my candidacy  which is really a case for all of us  as the mayor of los angeles  he needs a president who understands that we are going to work together and make sure that l a  remains a great  great city  so i came here today   hrc  thank you  thank you thank you  i came here today to continue to talk about what i want to do as your president  to me  running for office is not about the people who are running  now  that's what you see  don't you  you see that on tv  you see it on the papers  you see it on the internet  you hear it on the radio  but always remember that every election is about you  it's about your families  your futures  it's about your jobs  your health care  your children's education  it is about your sons and daughters who serve our country far away from home  it is about the american people and i am going to give this election back to you here in california and across our country  i have always  in thirty five years of working on behalf of children  women  families  workers  i've always listened because i think you can actually learn a few things if you do  to hear the voices that i have heard during this campaign makes me both humble and more determined and optimistic about what we can do together  i was in las vegas yesterday going door to door and i met wonderful  hard working families  i also met construction workers who had been laid off  i met workers who have lost their health care  i met families who asked me how they were ever going to afford to pay their children's college tuition  i hear all of the voices of america  one particular question that i hear a lot about today is what is happening with the economy  where are we  this economy may be working for some people  but it sure isn't working for everybody  part of what we've got to decide is whether we are just going to allow this economy to flip into recession  the economists can argue about it   you can see them on tv  some say   yes  it's going there  some say   not yet  some say   oh no  the statistics are one thing  the stories are something altogether different  if you've lost your job because construction has slowed down  you don't care what the economists are talking about  do you  what you care about is who is going to help me  i get up everyday and i try to work and there is not work there  if you've lost your health care because the insurance company refuses to pay for the problem you and your family have  or they won't even give it to you in the first place or your employer no longer provides it  it doesn't matter what somebody in washington is talking about  what matters is what you are going to do to take care of yourself and your family  if you are looking for a job and everywhere you go  you are told that those jobs are no longer plentiful in california or america because they've all been shipped over seas  it doesn't matter what you are told  it's what you feel  it's how you feel deep down that maybe the american dream is not going to be there for you and your family  every one of us who was just on that stage is a product of that american dream  every one of us worked our way into the positions we are  nobody handed us the silver platter  some of us broke some barriers to get there  we know something about working hard and we know something about what it means to reward that hard work  the way america has always worked is that if you're wiling to work hard and take responsibility  you will get ahead  you will make progress  your children will have more and better opportunities than you have had  you can look back at your parents and your grandparents and know what pride they must feel because of the progress that you and america have made together  that is why i am running for president  because i want to make sure the purpose of america  which is that progress and that pride continues for that little girl there and every other single child in america  long before you heard folks talking about maybe we're sliding into a recession  i saw it and i felt it  i represent a lot of hardworking people across the country in new york  and they began to say   wait a minute  it's like nobody even sees us any more  we have a president  we have a government that just doesn't seem to understand what's going on in the lives of people of this country   it's almost like we're invisible  people told me  that is not the america that i grew up in  that is not the america that i want to be there for our future  so there will be no invisible americans when i am president of the united states  thank you  thank you  thank you  for me  politics isn't a game  it is serious business about our future  it is about helping everyone get the tools they need to make the most of their own god give potential  it's about your voices  your dreams  your future  and so when i see a problem  i know that america's up to meeting it  if we have leaders who understand we have to pull together  we've got to be united  we've got to try to bring people together in order to address the big challenges we face in america  there's nothing america can't do if we make up our minds to do it together  that is the common purpose of america and that will be the purpose of my presidency  to listen to you  to be your voice in the white house  and to deliver results for you and your families  every single day  so here's what we have to decide  we have an economy that despite the happy talk from the white house and the republicans is not working for most americans  you know that  the average american family lost a thousand dollars in income over the last   years  health care premiums have doubled  energy costs have gone up   since george bush became president  i know sometimes people try to act like facts don't matter  you know  facts kind of get in the way of filling rhetoric or political combat  facts are stubborn and facts actually reflect the reality of what is going on in people's lives  and you think about all the talk from president bush about tax cuts  tax cuts  tax cuts  i'll tell you what  if you're wealthy and well connected  that talk turns into action  but if you are a middle class  working family  whatever tax cut you got from george bush  your energy cost went up three times more  so we're not going to make progress on a lot of these tough issues until we realize that we've got to get the two oil men out of the white house and begin to change direction  now i have laid out a long term strategy about how we're going to stabilize and grow the economy  i want to get back to where we see millions of new  good jobs created in america  i know we can do that  but i don't think we can wait until january  th of next year  too many people will be hurt  too many jobs will be lost  too many homes will be foreclosed on  too many more people will go without health care  we cannot wait  that is why i am calling on the president and the congress to work together to come up with some quick action to be able to present the slide toward recession  unlike president bush's   plan which focused on tax cuts in the wealthiest of americans  my plan focus on middle class and hardworking families who deserve the relief and need the help right now  now here's what i would do tomorrow if i could  first  i'm proposing a thirty billion dollar fund to help hard hit communities and distressed home owners whether the foreclosure crisis  right here  right here in california  you have   homes in foreclosure right now  yesterday  nevada  nevada has the highest rate of home foreclosures in america  i sat down at a restaurant in vegas talking to people who have already lost their homes  what happens in vegas when it comes to foreclosure  can't stay in vegas  we've got to talk about it across our country  this fund would give states and communities  it would give the mayor  it would give the speaker  it would give the lieutenant governor  it would give you resources to provide at risk families with desperately need services like financial counseling and legal assistance and help refinancing these unworkable  unaffordable loans and states and communities could also use these funds to offset the costs associated with rising foreclosures  everything from maintaining vacant properties to service like community policing  because sometimes people have talked about his mortgage crisis in a very narrow way  certain people are at risk of losing their homes or already have without seeing the broad implication of this  if you have home foreclosures in a neighborhood  you are likely in this housing market  to have vacant properties  when you have vacant properties you attract people that you don't want to be near your kids  you begin to have lower properties tax revenues so services get cut back which makes the problem even worse  i want us to start understanding that on every problem we face in america  we're in it together  it's not us versus them  it is all of us together  we have to come up with solutions and i believe we can start by focusing on them  second  i'm calling for comprehensive action to end the housing crisis and keep it from dragging down the entire economy  here's what i would do  number one  i'm calling for a  day moratorium on foreclosures  no foreclosures for three months  so if the bank is about to foreclose on your home  you'll have some breathing room to try to figure out how to restructure your mortgage  because here's what's happening  starting last march i said  we've had predatory lending practices  we've had people who put homeowners into mortgages they couldn't afford because they got more money for having a higher interest rate mortgage  we have a lot of people who could pay a good interest rate on a mortgage who were pushed into the ajudstable rate mortgages and once they go up  they're beyond somebody's' ability to pay for it  we have a lot of families who right now could stay in their homes and pay the mortgage they're paying but a lot of pressure is coming from the investors who bought all of these mortgages  because you understand it's not your local bank  its not the fellow who sold it to you who's now holding the mortgage  it's somebody sitting in shanghai or in dubai or berlin or in london or somewhere else in the world and what they're saying is  ok i'm supposed to get an interest rate return up here and if you stop me from getting that then i'm not getting the return on my investment  that's why last month i went to wall street  i represent wall street and i'm proud to do that because there are a lot of things that come out of there that raise wealth and give people opportunity but on this issue wall street is complicitous with the banks and the mortgage brokers and the lenders and everybody who took advantage of americans in this mortgage crisis  so if we can get a moratorium then we can get people to come in and say look why would you take somebody's home away because then you've got a vacant property you're probably not going to be able to sell   they're paying   now you want to jump it up to   you know they can't pay that  do you want some kind of return on your investment or you want a foreclosure with nothing ahead  then i want to say  look  we have to freeze interest rates for five years  let's just say we're not going to raise the interest rates on our mortgages  we want to convert these unaffordable mortgages into loans that families can afford  so if you have an adjustable rate mortgage that is about to skyrocket  you'll have the chance to stay in your home and pay affordable payments  now we're going to have to end the abusive practices that got us to where we are  and let me just mention one because it is the one that i get the most upset about and i heard about it yesterday talking to homeowners in nevada  a lot of people who were first time homeowners or who moved from a very small home with a growing family to a larger one  signed these mortgage papers   i got to tell you  i skimmed my mortgage papers  i didn't read them  i didn't know what was all that fine print and those pages and pages of legalese and most people who signed on the dotted line relied on what they were told  a lot of people who were these first time homeowners  they wanted to do the right thing  they talked to their friends and their families  people said   you've got a house now  if you can pay it off you'll own it free and clear sooner  in addition to the interest payment people started putting a little bit more in the check  because they thought they were doing the right thing  what they did not know is that there is a provision in a lot of these mortgages for prepayment penalties  in other words  you tried to do the right thing in your mind and you got hammered with an automatic increase in interest rates because the investors didn't want you to pay it off any sooner  they wanted to penalize you from trying  there are a lot of people out there who are being punished for doing what we would have thought was the right thing  now  next  we've got to invest in emergency energy assistance for families with skyrocketing heating bills this winter  today  nearly   million families across america are eligible for this assistance   but only about   receive it  a lot of parents and the mayor and i met a lot of people in new hampshire and in iowa in the snow  in the below zero chill factor  who were saying us  how am i going to afford to pay my utility bills  i can't go without the heat how am i going to afford to pay it  well maybe i won't take my prescription drugs  maybe i'll postpone the mortgage payment and hope that i can catch up with it later  so we've got to do more to get that assistance directly to people  and that's why i would provide an additional   billion in emergency assistance   enough to cover every single person who needs it so we can do the right thing  fourth  i would extend and expand unemployment insurance  including doubling the number of weeks people are eligible for assistance  because if you're out of work and you're struggling to find a job  you deserve a little extra help because if the economy is sliding into recession  there might not be a job there for you so what are you and your family supposed to live on and besides if you get that money in your pocket you'll spend it and that will give the economy an immediate boost which will help us from going deeper into economic troubles finally  i told you what i would do to try to solve the problems  here's what i would do to seize the opportunity  it has everything to do with what the ibew is doing along with neca because this is exactly where i would put money  i would take immediate steps to jump start  green collar  job growth all across america  sometimes when i talk about this i get blank stares to be honest  i really do because people can't know it if they haven't seen it  they know about white collar jobs they know about blue collar jobs but the idea of green collar jobs is something that folks are just beginning to appreciate  i teamed up with one of my fellow senators a few months ago and we passed legislation to put federal dollars into training people for green collar jobs what i want to do is accelerate that money to come to places like here to train more people  these renewable energy jobs are high wage jobs that cannot be outsourced  this is what we ought to be investing in with federal dollars right now  number one  i would immediately implement a green building fund to rebuild and renovate public buildings like schools  like municipal buildings  like law enforcement buildings  to make them more energy efficient  we know how to do this and i would do it immediately  i would issue an executive order saying there will not be any new federal buildings built or any one of the   that we have now renovated unless they become energy efficient and move toward carbon neutrality  this would create tens of thousands  eventually hundreds of thousands and millions of new good jobs  people would be put to work installing those solar panels on display here and other countries are head of us  but that doesn't mean anything because we can catch up in a hurry if we put our minds to it  but you've got to know  take germany  germany decided to invest dollars in new energy particularly solar  last time i looked  i don't think the climate in germany is as good as it is here in california but they have put nearly   people to work in a much smaller economy installing solar panels  making the displays  doing what is necessary to actually move practically and quickly toward renewable energy  i would also pursue a crash weatherization plan to help people insulate their homes you can save up to   on your energy bills if you start today  and that is obviously heating in the cold and cooling in the hot  you can save   but a lot of people don't know how to do that  they don't understand it  again here are jobs going into insulate homes  making sure that you have thicker glass  looking for ways to deliver on that   savings  i would begin to ask the utilities to in vest in conservation  it is in their long term interest but more importantly it is in america's long term interest that we start saving on energy  here i have to applaud california because back in the  's  which some of us can remember  a lot of us waited in line for gas for a long time  right  marvin  right  i remember getting my little  crummy car in line at   a m  spending an hour or two having somebody from the gas station walk down the cars and say   we've run out of gas  why don't you try the station down the road  when that happened it should have been the biggest wake up call in american history  we saw some changes  i give credit to president jimmy carter  he said   we've got to do better  we've got to conserve more  we've got to be more energy efficient  you know what happened  the price of oil fell and so everybody said   thank goodness we don't have to do any of that stuff  and we got lulled into a false sense of security  but not california  california took a hard look at gas mileage and began to make some changes  took a hard look at electricity usage and today  on average  a californian uses   less electricity than anybody anywhere else in america  california has led the way  made a difference  and i am strongly supportive of what the state is trying to do to begin to regulate tailpipe emissions  it's been a big fight with the epa and the bush administration but california can be the leader again  i would also do more to offer tax credits sooner rather than later for consumers who make energy efficient purchases   from upgrading your appliances  to buying hybrid vehicles  to installing new windows in your home  we all know that this is not only the right thing to do  this is smart  it'll save you money  i just recently was briefed about a new plug in electric car that runs on a new battery by an american car maker   because that's my goal  to have these cars made right here in america  and after test driving it for six months  they got   miles on ten gallons of gas  because think about this  if henry ford were to come back today and go out in the parking lot here and ask a couple of the ibew members to let him look at your car  he'd be amazed at the size and the power  he'd be amazed at the gps   the fact that somebody would talk to you and tell you where to go  that would be astonishing  that's science fiction   and then he would lift up the hood  and what would he see  the internal combustion engine  it really hasn't changed that much since the model t  we need to have a strategic energy fund that is looking at how we have new technology like what you are doing right here  with everything from our vehicles to our homes to our businesses to our utilities and make it a comprehensive plan  if the economy continues to worsen  if all of what i just proposed were put into place as an immediate jumpstart to get economic action going  to get consumers spending again  then i think we should look at providing an additional   billion in tax rebates to working and middle class families   not to the wealthy  they have more than gotten their share of our tax dollars  this relief would follow the same principles as the other initiatives i've outlined today  it would provide immediate  short term help  targeted to those in most in need and it would be fiscally responsible  now  will this be easy  no  it isn't easy  but i think if it were easy some other country would do it  we're the people who are supposed to do what is hard  we're the innovation nation  we're the folks who roll up our sleeves and get to work together  years from now i hope that our children and grandchildren will look back at this election and say   wow  thank goodness  this is when america came back and we came back strong  right now we're in a big hole  we've got to dig ourselves out  i want to pass out shovels to everybody  because i don't think it's in america's interest to borrow money from the chinese to buy oil from the saudis  i am going to do everything i can to make sure that we solve our problems  elections are not just about speeches  they're not just about all the cameras showing up  they are about what happens when a leader has to finally make some tough decisions  we've got challenges around the world   ending the war and dealing with all of the problems we are going to inherit from president bush  we have economic challenges  health care challenges here at home  i am listening  i have always listened  i want to be your voice in the white house  that is america's common purpose  let's make history together  thank you all very  very much "], ["clinton", "it is a dangerous mission to follow reverend youngblood  there isn't anyone who has not only preached for justice but stood for justice as he has over so many years and we are so grateful for his leadership and his witness  i am honored to be with you and with all of these leaders here before you  it a pleasure to be celebrating dr  king's life and to carry forth his vision  to do so on behalf of those who deserve economic justice  i want to start with a thank you  for eight years i have been in and out of many of the buildings that you secure  i have shook many of your hands  i have thanked you for your work  i have breathed a sigh of relief that you were there and on the job and i know how important the work is that you do  let me  on behalf of so many who appreciate you and understand that you deserve a living wage with health care benefits  because you do work that benefits all of us  thank you and god bless you for all that you do for all of us every single day  i want to thank the leadership of   bj  mike fishman and the great leadership team that he has  i want to thank all the clergy who are here  i want to thank bct for being behind this important cause  you've heard from our wonderful elected officials  greg meeks who just left  bill thompson  anthony weiner  we know how much hazel dukes has meant to all of us for so many years  she's my friend  she's my mentor  i am here today because of you and because the work that dr  king started and the work he was doing when his life was cut short is directly related to your cause  you're organizing  mobilizing  your refusing to back down when the going gets hard  everyday that you stand up and speak for justice  you are the living embodiment of dr  king's legacy  he may not be here  as reverend youngblood said  in person but he is here in spirit because we are bringing together those who labor hard everyday and the faith community that understands the cause for which you labor  the cause of justice and righteousness  the legacy that you embody may be different from the jobs of the sanitation workers in memphis  but the cause  the cause  is the same  you may be new to this country  you may not have ever celebrated dr  king's holiday before  but his cause and his sacrifice  no matter where you came from  is yours  you may be a security guard working to keep body and soul together  worried how you are going to put food on the table and health care for your children and maybe save a little along the way  you may have been born after dr  king left us  but your cause is his  when i think about how much stronger we are when we join forces  it is for me the progress that america has made  people of faith coming together with people of labor  back in   dr  king sent a telegram to the labor leader cesar chavez  he was waging a hunger strike on behalf of farm workers  dr  king wrote   our separate struggles are really one  a struggle for freedom  for dignity  and for humanity  that is why  that very same year  dr  king traveled to memphis  tennessee and offered his support to striking sanitation workers  he told them   either we go up together  or we go down together  the cause for justice has always come from people of faith and people of labor  here in this great hall today  you understand  as dr  king did  that your cause was his cause  his movement was a broad and deep one  it was a movement to redeem the soul of america  to fulfill the common purpose of our nation  a movement inspired by the idea  as he put it  that  injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere  and that included economic justice  the injustice of poverty  the injustice of people who work hard all day and then on the night shift  and it is still not enough  the injustice of being invisible in a country of so much wealth and opportunity  having people walk by you in the halls and foyers and staircases of buildings you work and not even see you  not stopping to say thank you  thank you for being on duty tonight  thank you for telling us about the problem that happened yesterday  thank you for helping me to feel secure  that invisibility eats away at the heart and soul of america  there should not be any invisible americans and if it's up to the faith community and the labor community and political leaders like those of us here today  there will not be invisible workers anywhere  ever again  we see so much injustice in an economy that simply isn't working for so many of our families  typical american family's income is down nearly   in the last six years  wages are flat but health care costs are up  gas and energy are up  education costs are up  people are running as hard they can but they are going backwards  they are not getting ahead  so many families feel like they are standing on a trap door  one pink slip  one medical diagnosis away from losing everything  the cause of your family is the cause of every american family and should be the cause of all of us  when security workers here in new york   the people who keep our city safe   don't have the health care or the training they need and desire  when they're not paid enough or valued enough   their cause is our cause  when african american and latino workers still face discrimination in the workplace   when their children still attend schools that are separate and unequal  when they cannot feel that they are part of the american dream today  then your cause is our cause  when a pregnant woman is told   i'm sorry  but your employment is no longer needed  when women are still paid just   cents on every dollar a man makes   and women of color even less  your cause is our cause  we need to be recommitted to dr  king's dream  it was a dream that demanded action and he gave that action everyday of his life until he was taken from us  we must demand that every american share in this nation's prosperity  every american  no matter where you start out  should have the opportunity to fulfill your god given potential  when the measure of our progress is taken as a nation  it is not how many people became the richest in the world  it is how many could share in the american dream and feel secure in their own lives and in the lives of their children  reverend youngblood was saying that mike fishman would have invited dr  king to speak today and he would have come  too  i remember hearing him speak when i went with my church into downtown chicago to see and hear for myself someone who had burst through the stereotypes and the caricatures  who could not be held back by being beat or gassed or jailed  whose cause was so powerful that he was finally speaking not just to the whole country but to the entire world  i sat there as a young girl transfixed and transformed because the sermon he gave that day was will we stay awake through the revolution  the revolution comes and change is made  and those of us who benefit  we move on  but this is a never ending revolution for justice and equality and we at our peril think that the work is over because we have benefitted  wherever there is injustice it is an affront to us  i believe you have to listen in order to lead  i believe that as the scripture says  we cannot just be  hearers of the word  we must be  doers  of the word  i believe as i was taught that  faith without works is dead and work without faith is just too hard  we are called upon today in new york city to fulfill the unfinished dream and to live the legacy that we have inherited  each of us  no matter who we are or where we started from  is a beneficiary of dr  king  we are also a beneficiary of labor leaders like mike fishman and  bj  who never give up on the dream of equality and justice  it's now up to us to answer the urgent question  whether we will continue the work  whether we have it in ourselves to go the distance  whether we will stand up to the forces that do not believe   do not believe   in the fundamental value that each of us was endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights and that as americans we are entitled to the justice we were promised  will we deliver on jobs with living wages  will we deliver on the promise of health care for   million americans without it and the many more who don't have enough to meet the needs they have  will we deliver on the promise of the right to organize and bargain collectively which is a fundamental human right  will we deliver on the american dream that cannot be realized if we turn our backs on labor and the struggles to give hardworking people the rights they deserve to have  it won't be easy  but nothing worth doing ever is  you are now part the great forward movement of progress in america  you heard reverend youngblood talk about how we have tried to realize a more perfect union  we can point to progress even though the journey is not over  how many of you ever dreamed you'd see the day when a woman and an african american were running for presidency of the united states of america  that should cause our hearts to leap with joy and celebration  i know that we have to bring our party together and country together  frederick douglass  the great abolitionist who did some of his best work here in new york  spoke out not only for the abolition of slavery but for women's rights  he said back in   summed up on the masthead of his newspaper called north star  that right is of no sex and truth is of no color  god is the father of us all and we are brethren  we have a great journey ahead of us as americans  we need to bring together of the democratic party  which has been on the front lines of the civil rights movement  women's rights movement  and the human rights movement  we need to bring together the labor movement  which has been there every step of the way to get us to where we are today and to keep moving forward for justice  we may differ on minor matters but when it comes to what is really important  we are family  we are all bound together to ensure that the least  the last and the lost among us be given every opportunity to break the chains that still hold them back and down  the security workers are the workers we focus on today  the organizing that is happening will  i hope  result soon in justice and economic opportunity  but the struggle never ends and we all have to remain on the front lines of that struggle  both senator obama and i know that we are where we are today because of leaders like dr  king and generations of men and women like all of you   people who looked into the eyes of their children and saw the promise of a better future  who protested and picketed  who faced dogs and tear gas and nightsticks against their skulls  some  like dr  king  even gave their lives  but they also voted and they brought people to the polls and they held leaders accountable for delivering on the promise  in his speech to the sanitation workers in memphis forty years ago  dr  king urged them to  move on in these powerful days  these days of challenge to make america what it ought to be  it was his very last speech   he was killed the next day  but less than a week later  his brave widow  coretta scott king  returned to memphis  she had not yet buried her husband  but was determined to finish his work and with three of her children at her side  she led a march through the streets of memphis  tens of thousands of people in solidarity with those striking sanitation workers  eight days later  they got their contract  today  it is up to us to continue that march  that march for freedom  justice  equality  opportunity  it is up to us to make america what it ought to be  it is up to us to stand up for workers here in new york and across this land  i know that working together  relying on the faith and labor communities  we will find our way  we will meet our challenges  we will finally fulfill the promise of this country we love and when we do  it will be because of so many brave people like all of you  thank you so much and god bless you "], ["clinton", "i had a great campaign here  i had a lot of wonderful help from friends around the country  like mayor villaraigosa from los angeles  who has been with me  and i am particularly gratified that the people of nevada have given us such a positive send off this is one step on a long journey throughout the country as we put our cases forward and take that case to the people and this was an especially wonderful day for me so i'd be glad to answer your questions q   off mike clinton  well  you know  i don't have any response to that  i think that we had a very effective campaign  we have a lot of reports ourselves and  obviously  we're not focused on that right now  because the fact is that people turned out and i got a significant share of the popular vote and i think that   you know  my view always is you just keep going  and that's what we intend to do q   off mike  of the popular vote  but you may not have won in the delegates  your response to that clinton  well  nobody really knows and we are looking very good  obviously  this is about delegates  but it's also about what people are voting for and who they think the best president will be and i find it somewhat strange  actually  that there is such a reaction when this was a very effective campaign to reach as many people as possible and we did and i'm very proud of that question  what do you think made the difference here in nevada clinton  i think it was the message of real results  that we want to solve problems  the people of nevada spent a lot of time talking to me about their worries concerning the economy and health care and education  home foreclosures  which i spend a lot of time talking about  because it's such a problem here in nevada and i think that the people of nevada  they want somebody who's going to give them solutions  not just rhetoric  they want to hear what it is you're going to do  and i have been very specific about my plans  because i want to be held accountable i want people to know what i plan to do  because i want to bring accountability back into our government  i want people to understand that we can meet these challenges  we shouldn't be overwhelmed by them  we shouldn't get discouraged about them  we can do that and i think the best way for me to do that is to be very specific about how i think together we can solve our problems question   off mike clinton  i don't know  we'll have plenty of time to analyze that  but i am very proud of a lot of people who came out to support me against some pretty tough odds  and i know that it wasn't easy for them  i know their stories "], ["clinton", "thank you  thank you all so much  thank you  you know  i am so happy to be back here at furman  i was at furman with dick and chucky riley back in   for a speech and a question and answer program there  and i had such a wonderful time  it's great to be here again  i've been at one of the extension buildings of the university in this campaign  but to be back and talking about the economic challenges facing our country is a great honor  i am so sorry to be late  i apologize for that  some of it was us off to a late start  but there were other things we had to deal with  and some of it was delays in air travel  but i appreciate your patience and your willingness to be here  i apologize for everybody stuck outside  we have a long  long line of people who can't get in  i'm not sure that everybody thought a speech about the economy would draw such a big crowd  so  i apologize to all of you as well  and of course  i want to thank dick riley for his years of service to the state of south carolina and to our country  he is such a unique public servant and a wonderful  great man  and i want to thank frank holleman who was out speaking here with you before  and lottie gibson  state representative fletcher smith  who i'm proud to have supporting me  i want to thank the conference center here and kay cornelison  who is the director and all of you who have come  i particularly want to thank a group of veterans who are traveling throughout the state on my behalf  we have them all over the state  we have several of them here today  led by hershel gober  the former secretary of veteran affairs  hank naughton  an iraq veteran and a state representative from massachusetts  pat lewis  another veteran  reverend tim brown  another supporter  i'm very honored to have the support of so many of our veterans  we have a lot of work to do on that front  and if you want to know the details talk to hershel and the veterans who are here  because they can give you chapter and verse about what we need to do to keep faith with our veterans  but i want to turn to the economy  you know  in just a few days  on monday night  president bush will give his final state of the union address  it's enough to make you want to burst out in song  don't worry  i'll spare you  you don't have to listen to me sing  after seven years of inattention  neglect and denial  this monday night  president bush may well actually discuss the serious economic problems we face  and it's about time  you know  we didn't hear from him when the typical family incomes dropped   over the past seven years     for african american families  as health care premiums nearly doubled  gas prices more than doubled  and college costs here in south carolina rose   since   the fastest increase in america  we didn't hear from him as more than two million foreclosure notices went out     properties right here in south carolina are in some stage of foreclosure  that's   families that are facing the potential loss of the american dream  we didn't hear from him as unemployment reached a two year high last month  with south carolina having the third highest unemployment rate in america  or as nearly five million americans fell back into poverty     in south carolina alone  but now  finally  the president may acknowledge what the american people have known for years  that the economy is not working for middle class and working families  and i welcome the president to this conversation  because it's a conversation that americans have been having and that i've been having with so many people every day for years  i've listened to the voices of so many americans as i've traveled the country  the voices of people who work hard all day   then sometimes additionally on the night shift   but it's still not enough  people who whisper to me about the mortgages they can't afford and the homes they're losing  about medical bills that wiped them and their savings out  about tuition costs that have cut short the hopes they had about sending a child to college  many people are simply overwhelmed by the economic conditions they confront every day  i've heard from plenty of people who also tell me   i'm ok right now  but what about next year   or even next month  the way things are going with people losing jobs and homes  what if my family is next  this is a time of uncertainty and growing anxiety  we didn't wind up here by accident  as president kennedy once observed   economic policy can result from government inaction as well as governmental action  we're here in part because the president failed to listen to the voices of people who are hurting  failed to get involved in the actual work of running the government  and failed to act  instead  he has stayed at a comfortable cruising altitude  well above the realities of people's lives  delegating responsibilities to his advisers  hoping the buck would stop somewhere else anywhere else  in just seven years  this administration has taken us from record surpluses into a large and growing deficit  from a projected   trillion surplus to a   trillion debt  we have seen our growing  thriving economy that created   million jobs in the  s pushed to the brink of recession  and we're seeing the ripple effects around the world  this week  many countries saw their largest one day stock market declines since september     in this new century  the stakes have never been higher  the challenges have never been bigger or more urgent  but the opportunities are also there  if we get about the business of seizing them  now  our economic problems are admittedly complex  but there is one thing we know for sure  the problem with our economy is not the american people  instead  the problem is  in part  the bankrupt ideas that have governed us for the last seven years  they have rewarded the very few at the expense of the many  the american people are actually the solution to our economic problems  americans are the hardest working people in the world   our productivity goes up every year  that means we work harder and harder and produce more  people are innovators  they are entrepreneurs  they take risks  they start small businesses  they are constantly thinking about the future  the factory worker and the ceo  the farmer or the small business owner  the scientist in the lab  or the teacher in the classroom  everybody who gets up every day and gets their job done  supports their families   that is the strength of the american economy  and it's time we finally had a president who worked as hard for you as you work for america every single day  because  in the end  it is all about people  it is all about the woman in columbia who grabbed my hand and said that her child was sick and the insurance company wouldn't pay for the treatment that was necessary  it's all about the man in florence some months ago who came up to me some months ago and said   i just keep working harder and harder and i feel like i'm falling further and further backwards  but i have a small business  i depend on transporting my goods  and the cost of energy just keeps going up  it's about the real lives of real people right here in south carolina  the presidency matters more now than ever  we need a president who will run the government and manage the economy  american people don't hire a president to talk about our problems but to solve them  to set a vision for the future  and then to roll up our sleeves and get about fulfilling it  it's time for a president who believes that leading an economic comeback is a fulltime  hands on job  who renews our commitment to a strong and prosperous middle class and brings business  labor and government together to restore america's competitiveness in a fast changing world  a president who has a vision for a twenty first century economy based on shared prosperity  where we measure our success not by the wealth at the very top but by how broadly wealth is shared  you know  with all due respect to a lot of my friends on the other side of the aisle  i do not believe it is rich people who made america great  i believe it is the hard working people of america who made our country great  we want to get back to rewarding hard work  we want the american dream to be within everyone's reach  we want to make investments in one another that allow us  particularly our children  to live up to our god given potential  these are not just economic issues  these are moral issues about our common purpose as a nation  whether people can provide for their families  whether they can share in the blessings of this great country   that speaks to who we are as a people and what we value  the way we bring our country together is by acting on our values  true unity can only be achieved by finding real solutions for the american people  and then delivering them  without real solutions  division and disappointment  not unity  will be the result  we've been there before  president bush promised to be a uniter  not a divider  and we know how well that turned out  because unity comes from taking on the tough challenges  asking us to be bigger than ourselves  summoning up to greatness  again  and that is what i intend to do as president  on day one  i will bring the voices of the american people back to the white house  i will ask all of us to be involved in solving our problems  otherwise  here is what i fear  most of us  as i look around this room  with the exception of the students who are crowded into the foyer and spilling out the door  we have been the beneficiaries of the sacrifices that came from previous generations  from parents and grandparents  from people who fought the wars  and built big businesses  and did the labor  who created the extraordinary success of that america is  we have to keep faith with all that came before us  i don't think any of us want to be part of the first generation of americans to leave our country worse off than when we found it  that would be such a breach with what american history has meant to all of us  so the time for waiting is over and the time for talk is over  too many families are paying the price of inaction  right here and right now   so i think we need to begin acting  and we can't wait until january     we need both an immediate  short term plan to jumpstart the economy   and a long term economic vision with strategies to keep the economy going well into the future  so let's start with the short term  if i were president right now  i would work with the congress to jumpstart the economy by immediately addressing the housing crisis  creating new jobs  and getting money back into the pockets of the american people  we know that the loss of a home is devastating and so many families across our country are facing that  but it's not only those who are actually losing their homes i worry about  because of this mortgage crisis  every home owner is losing value in our homes  the american people have lost more than   trillion worth of value in our homes in the last year   that's nearly half the size of the entire united states government budget  and african american families are especially hard hit   subprime loans are five times more common in predominantly african american neighborhoods than predominantly white ones  but this is not just an economic crisis  it is truly an american dream crisis  your home isn't just your only greatest source of wealth   it's your greatest source of security  it's what anchors us to our neighborhoods and communities  it's where we raise our kids  celebrate birthdays and holidays  and make memories together  i have visited with so many people in their homes and i know what our homes mean to us  i know the feel of refuge and security i feel when i walk into my own home  i know what it's like to sit in homes where families haven't had the money to buy all the furniture they need but they're so proud to show off their new home  and nearly a year ago  i called for immediate action to address this mounting mortgage crisis  less than two weeks after that  the bush administration told congress that what i was calling for wasn't necessary  that the problem was contained  several months later  the president assured us that there would be a soft landing for the housing market  but now we know better  so all of last year  i proposed policies to help families keep their homes  i wrote to the regulators urging them to take their heads out of the sand and do something for the millions of families at risk of foreclosure  i introduced legislation to crack down on abusive lending practices and give states the resources to help at risk families avoid losing their homes  the result  a plan from president bush that lets banks off the hook and leaves homeowners to fend for themselves  in the words of one expert  the president's plan was  the bank lobby's dream  this administration has delivered a foreclosure notice on the american dream  the president's plans to fix our economy would do next to nothing about the foreclosure crisis  and they said that my insistence on stopping foreclosures just doesn't make sense  well i'm sorry to disagree  the housing crisis is contributing to rising unemployment  construction jobs are disappearing  and i see a few hard hats here in the audience  south carolina alone lost   construction jobs in   it's erasing families' wealth  jeopardizing consumer spending  which constitutes two thirds of our economy  it's caused   billion in losses to banks  making them less likely to offer credit to businesses and families that need it  that's why my plan to fix the economy starts by doing everything possible to ensure that we don't lose any more homes and that we stabilize the economy when it comes to the mortgage crisis  i want to start with a  day moratorium on foreclosures  if the bank is about to foreclose on your home  you should have some breathing room to restructure your mortgage  i'm calling for freezing the monthly rate on adjustable rate mortgages for at least five years or until the mortgages have been converted into loans that families can afford  if you have an adjustable mortgage that's about to skyrocket  you'll have the chance to pay it off with affordable payments  people say well isn't this rewarding people who maybe got in over their heads  well to some extent it is trying to stop what is happening that will affect all of us  if we don't help these families work out their mortgages now we will have more empty homes because the housing market is so low right now  nobody is buying  then we'll have deteriorating neighborhoods  then we'll have decreasing tax revenues for cities and towns  it becomes a vicious cycle  that's why i also would also create a   billion fund to help hard hit communities and distressed homeowners weather the foreclosure crisis  we need to be sure to shore up our communities so that they don't begin to also deteriorate in the face of a loss in the home market  i also would include direct tax rebates to working and middle class families  we need to target it to those who are most in need  the democratic leadership in the house and senate along with the white house appear to be nearing a deal and i am heartened to hear that they are planning to extend assistance to the tens of millions of working americans who need it the most  that's what i have been calling for and that's what i think we have to do  but i also want to target the needs of working families that are really facing tough choices  we need relief from skyrocketing energy bills  we need expanded unemployment insurance for those who are struggling to find a job  but i want to think about the future  that's why i would take immediate steps to spur  green collar  job growth  high wage  renewable energy jobs that are good for our environment and cannot be outsourced  i would do this immediately through a crash weatherization program that would put people to work  helping to insulate homes  and give green collar job training initiatives to help prepare people  i would also implement my green building fund to rebuild and renovate schools and other public buildings to help make them more energy efficient  we can create millions of new jobs in america through clean  renewable energy  i know we can do it because i've seen what other countries have done  germany decided a few years ago to make a big bet on solar power  they creating tax incentives  they created training programs to take construction workers and others to know how to install solar panels  they have created several hundred thousand new jobs in three short years  they have a smaller economy than ours  if we got serious about this  i know we could do the same  i really hope that as part of this recovery package  we start getting serious about the future  we have to stop the crisis but then we have to plan for an economy that will keep generating good new jobs  and clean energy is our best bet  but jumpstarting the economy in the short term is just the beginning  we need a long term vision to build a strong  prosperous economy for the next generation  i think it was winston churchill who said that  the difference between a politician and a statesman is that the politician thinks about the next election  while the statesman thinks about the next generation  we've got to start thinking about the next generation  we can't do this piecemeal  we've got to start helping people more  maybe you want to start saving for retirement  but you can't do it because your taxes are too high and your wages aren't high enough  maybe you want to go back to school  but your health care premiums are too high so you can't afford tuition  we live in a complex  interconnected  global economy  all of our challenges are all together now  we can't just put band aids on one and expect to solve our problems  what we have to do is have a plan to create good jobs and restore fairness to the economy  we need to renew the promise of america that if you work hard  you can get ahead  we need to return to fiscal responsibility  so that washington once again lives within a budget  just like you and your family has to do  i believe solving the jobs crisis over the long run starts with solving the energy crisis  that's why i will create a   billion strategic energy fund to jumpstart investments in clean energy technologies  we will create a green revolution with investments in biofuels  wind  solar  geothermal  all of the clean energy and energy efficiency changes we need to make  and as we create these new job possibilities for the next generation we will pay for it by eliminating the tax subsidies for the big oil companies and require them to pay into the strategic energy fund  or invest in alternative energy themselves  they have made record profits in recent years  now it's time they did their fair share  i also know that we won't get any of this done until the two oil men leave the white house but as soon as they do  we will start to work on this long term vision  we also help create jobs by modernizing and rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure  the tragic bridge collapse in minnesota this past summer  a recent levee break in nevada  and what happened with the levees in new orleans are painful reminders that our infrastructure is in dangerous disrepair  every billion dollars that we spend fixing crumbling infrastructure creates   new jobs  i have a rebuild america plan to invest   billion over ten years in an  emergency repair fund  we need to modernize our ports  our rail systems  our airports  our public transit systems  our bridges  our tunnels  our roads  we need to expand access to broadband across america  particularly to rural areas  we need to end this administration's war on science and restore america to its rightful place  as the innovation nation  i will increase investments in basic and applied research at the national science foundation  the national institutes of health and our other government agencies and universities  we became so successful after world war ii because business and science worked hand in hand with government  our great universities like furman were on the cutting edge of discoveries that we translated into better outcomes for people  but creating jobs is just the beginning  we need to empower our workers and ensure that our tax system is fair  that's the second piece of a long term plan  for the past seven years  the oil companies  the predatory student loan companies  the insurance companies  the drug companies have had a president who stands up for them  i intend to be a president who stands up for you every single day about how we make america work better for you  during the  s and  s which many of us look back at with great appreciation because the economy worked so well  for so long  for so many  we had a much higher percentage of our workforce unionized  now it is much lower  we need to make sure people can organize and bargain for good wages and safe working conditions  we need to be sure that we restore fairness to the economy by restoring fairness to the tax code  right now  some of the people i represent in new york city  wall street investment managers  making   million a year pay just   on their earnings   while a teacher making   pays   i don't think that's right and i've been calling to raise the taxes on those people at the top  as corporate profits have skyrocketed  the percentage of taxes paid by corporations has fallen  we have richly rewarded people and i am all in favor of incentivizing people to do well  that is part of what america stands for  but it isn't right that the wealthy and the well connected have gotten so many more benefits than the middle class and working people have  we need to extend middle class tax cuts  including the child tax credit  marriage penalty relief  we need to reform the alternative minimum tax to ensure it doesn't hit middle class families with higher tax rates  it was never supposed to do that  we need to expand the earned income tax credit and raise the minimum wage to ensure that work pays for all americans  no one who works full time should live in poverty  if you're working full time you shouldn't be in poverty  we need to give people the tools and support they need to succeed in today's complex economy  that starts with recommitting ourselves to making college affordable for our young people  that's especially important here in south carolina  the average student debt upon graduation is   so you start in a big hole before you ever go to work on the first day  and you know what's happened which is really troubling to me america's higher education system which was the envy of the world  we had an open system  the highest percentage of young people who went to get degrees  but now from japan to south korea to canada and ireland  other countries are educating their young people at a higher rate than here in america  the reason for that is the cost has exploded  it is more expensive today than it was thirty years ago to send a child to college  that's why i've outlined a comprehensive plan to open the doors of college to young people  it includes a new   college tax credit that will cover more than   of the typical cost of public colleges and universities or the full cost of tuition and fees for community colleges  i also want to increase the size of pell grants  something that former secretary riley mentioned  i want to strengthen community colleges  invest   million to support innovative  on the job training and apprenticeship programs for those who don't go to college  we also have to ensure that every american has quality  affordable health care  here in south carolina alone    people are uninsured  i want to ask you  how many of you know someone here in south carolina who is uninsured  how many of you know somebody who may have insurance but it just doesn't pay for what the doctor or the hospital says you need  we have two problems we have the problem of the uninsured and the problem of the underinsured  my american health choices plan would insure every single person for what they need  it's simple  if you have insurance you like  you keep it  there is no disruption  if you have a good policy through your business or through a union or through a municipality  nothing changes  but if you don't have insurance   or you don't like the insurance you have   you can choose from the same menu of private plans available to members of congress  and we will provide tax credits to help you afford it  my plan also bans insurance company discrimination  so you will never be denied coverage because of pre existing conditions or risk factors that you might have  and we don't require small business to do anything but it does provide tax credits to help small businesses if they choose to afford to buy health care for their employees  finally  we have to help more americans save for a secure retirement  right now  fewer than half of all americans have any retirement savings account at all  when i'm president  i want to provide every single american with an easy  automatic opportunity to save for the future through  american retirement accounts  these accounts will take the best of the  k plans and make them available to every working family  and we'll give families up to   in tax cuts to help them save  and finally we've got to return to fiscal responsibility  year after year  the president has increased spending at more than double the rate of the previous administration and handed tax cut after tax cut to multi millionaires  oil companies and other interest groups  and how has he paid for all of this spending  by borrowing money from foreign countries like china  when people ask me  why is it hard to get tough on china and enforce our trade agreements  i tell them  because they're our bankers  we owe them  how can we truly enforce the trade laws against a country like china  when our economy depends on china's massive loans to us  think about it this way  we borrow money from china to buy oil from the saudis  that is a dead end strategy for america  and i'm going to end that strategy if i have the good fortune of becoming your president  because i want america to regain control of its destiny by moving back toward a balanced budget and a surplus  that's why i've worked throughout this campaign to show exactly how i would pay for every initiative that i have just mentioned  not just how i'll run my campaign  but run our country as well  you know  today  some people around the world and even some here at home are basically saying   well  we can't go back to the kind of economy we had before  they act as though the  s was ancient rome  it worked well in the  s  the average american family had a   gain in income in the  s  well  every election is about the future but i do think there are lessons we need to learn from the past  because right now  we are on the wrong track  we are undermining our security at home and around the world  we are undermining the american dream here at home  you know  great presidents have always understood the greatness of the american people  think about president franklin roosevelt  faced with a depression  grave threats to america's freedom  he responded with bold solutions  yes  they were sometimes controversial  but we rose from economic chaos and despair and at the time he died we were months away from winning a world war  he didn't paint a rosy scenario  he didn't ignore the tough challenges  he urged us to confront them   we have a great many problems ahead of us  he said   and we must approach them with realism and courage  he believed we could tackle our greatest challenges  and i believe exactly the same  we have to overcome the fear and fatalism that president bush has used to divide us and set us against one another  when i sometimes here the president or the vice president  i don't hear america talking  you know   we can't solve the energy crisis without wrecking our economy  we can't provide affordable quality healthcare without wrecking our healthcare system  we can't have an economy anymore that creates a rising standard of living for everybody willing to work hard  since when did america become the can't do country  that is not the america we know and love  we are going to face the future with our optimism  with our faith  our belief that we can overcome any challenge  i am optimistic  i know we are facing some tough  tough issues  i think about it every day  i'm asking the people of south carolina to take a chance on me  just like i asked the people of new york to take a chance on me back in   i came and said   if you will give me a chance  i will work my heart out for you  you will have someone who gets up every day  thinking about you  i am not a show horse  i'm a work horse  and i will go to work for you  but i'm not going to do it alone  i can't do it alone  we all have to be in this together  you know  when i talk about a clean  green renewable energy future  i'm going to ask all for you to be more energy efficient  to think about what it means when you keep the lights on  when you drive more than maybe you need to  making three trips to the mall instead of one sensible one  i want you to think about every time you fill up the gas tank  or leave those lights on  you're sending money to oil companies and oil producing countries that don't always have our best interests at heart  when i say we need a new approach to healthcare that provides quality  affordable healthcare for every american  i'm going to ask you to take better care of your health and the health of your children  because we can have the best health care system in the world but we've got to be healthier  we've need a system of wellness  not one that just intervenes with sickness  we've got to be once again the american people that are on the front lines of change and progress together  we are the oldest democracy in the world for a reason  because whenever times are tough  whenever the challenges are big and the stakes are huge  we always respond  now  winston churchill also said that the american people finally get around to doing the right thing after trying nearly everything else  well  we've tried nearly everything else over the last seven years  and i think we've learned our lesson  so now what we need to do is face the future realistically  courageously  confidently  and optimistically  i know we can do this together  i need your help in the primary on saturday  i need you to vote not just for me but for yourselves  your family  and your future  i am ready to lead on day one  and if you give me that opportunity  we will restore pride and progress in our country together  thank you all very  very much "], ["clinton", "well  i have to thank my friend  state senator thelma harper  isn't she amazing  and i am so grateful that she is one of the leaders of my campaign here in tennessee  along with jane eskin  ph  who is here with me  and i thank jane and her husband  dick  and former governor ned ray mcwherter  it's wonderful to have such a broad cross section of people across this state who are fighting with us for a new future for america  i want to thank dr  johnson  thank you so much  please  doctor  thank you so much for inviting us and being here with us  you and mrs  johnson  thank you very much  i want to thank the band  were they great  and i want to thank all of you for coming out here tonight  this is an amazing crowd  i am thrilled to be here in tennessee with all of you and i'm so happy my daughter  chelsea  can be with me tonight  i want to congratulate senator obama tonight and i want to also thank the people of south carolina for welcoming us into their homes and their communities  and i want to tell you how excited i am that now the eyes of the country turn to tennessee and the other states that'll be voting on february  th and  of course  to the state of florida that will be voting on tuesday  so millions and millions of americans are going to have the chance to have their voices heard and their votes counted  and i can't imagine anyplace i'd rather be than right here in nashville as we kick off the next   days   applause  now  of course  when anybody says the word nashville  it's always connected with singing  and  i promise you  you will not hear a word out of me  i do not want to in any way sully the reputation of the music capital by contributing my less than meager talents  but it is a great treat to be here with all of you and to have a chance to talk with you and  really  that's what i want to do tonight  i know the crowd is a little bigger than we anticipated  but i intended to come   applause    i intended to come here tonight to continue the conversation i started a year ago  to talk with the people of our country about what it is we can do together to make sure that we keep faith with this country we love so much  i know that it's often said the difference between a politician and a statesman is that the politician looks to the next election and the statesman looks to the next generation  and i want this election to be about the next generation  the students here at tsu and all the young people who are here tonight and across tennessee   applause  and what i have heard traveling around our country is  of course  the optimism and the resilience that is the character of the american people  but i've also heard a lot of concerns and worries  people are worrying about their jobs  worrying about what's happening to the economy in general  worrying about their health care  worrying about college affordability and how they're going to be able to complete their education  worried about our country's standing in the world and how we can restore our reputation  our leadership and our moral authority  so there's a lot we can talk about tonight  and i want us to just to imagine  even in the size of this crowd  that we're just talking  we're just people having a conversation about what we believe and what we want  what we hope  and that we're looking for solutions to our problems  because i think there isn't anything america can't do if we put our mind to it  we are the nation that solves problems and creates new opportunities and we can do that again together  and it's so important we do that for our young people  many of us  as i look around this crowd  know that we were given blessings and opportunities that we inherited  didn't we  and those were the results of the hard work of our parents  our grandparents  and people we never met  people who defend our freedoms  people who created the businesses that employed us  who pushed down the barriers that prevented any of us from fulfilling our god given potential  so now it's time for us to do the same for the next generation  to make sure that we leave america   end of coverage "], ["clinton", "thank you  it is so good to be here in hartford  back in connecticut  i am thrilled to see all of you  i want to thank nancy for her really kind words  but the part of it that touched me the most was when she said that she wanted me to be the president for her grandchildren  that is something that i so deeply treasure  thank you  nancy  it is wonderful to be back with your attorney general  dick and i went to law school together in new haven at yale  i have followed his distinguished public career here in connecticut with such admiration  he is generally believed to be best attorney general in the entire united states of america  i appreciate greatly what he has been doing and particularly his point about how you have to be willing to fight for what you believe in  dick and i have joined together against the broadwater plan in the south  which we don't think is in the best interest of new york and connecticut  of our environment  or of our future  it is an honor to be standing side by side with him and a lot of these important fights for connecticut and new york and america  i want to thank my co chairs  susan cocco and representative jason bartlett  i want to thank the members of the steering committee for my campaign here in connecticut  and the state legislature who are here  if they could all raise their hands so i can express my appreciation  the hartford mayor  eddie perez  state representative  kelvin roldan  bruce douglas and the faculty and the staff here  the bridgeport mayor  bill finch  all of the elected officials and i see my good friend from massachusetts congressman  jim mcgovern  i'm so pleased that you all are here with me  it is exciting to be in this learning corridor  i am thrilled with what i see here  i have been to hartford many times  i've been here visiting friends  been here doing business  been here supporting people running for office here in connecticut  i first started coming to hartford on sunday afternoons  back when i was in law school  bill had this old  beat up car  it was called an opel  i don't even know if they make them anymore  it was the kind of car that was held together by duct tape  to be real honest  but sometimes after a long week of studying and all that we did in law school  we'd get in that old car and we'd just travel all over connecticut  we went from one end of the state to the other  it is such a beautiful state  i had so many happy hours here traveling across connecticut  of course  i am thrilled to be your neighbor now from new york  living close by in chappaqua and being able to work on so many of the concerns that affect our two states  boy  we have a lot of concerns we have to deal with  don't we  i assume that all of you know tonight is a red letter night in american history  it is the last time george bush will give a state of the union  if we all do our part  next year it'll be a democratic president giving the state of the union  let's be clear  one thing that president bush has never understood is that the state of the union is not about a speech in washington  it is about the state of the lives of the american people  what is happening in our schools  in our hospitals  in our jobs  it is whether or not we have people who feel that they are moving toward the american dream or whether it looks like it's getting further and further away no matter how hard they work  it is about whether or not people will be able to stay in their homes or if they will lose their homes to foreclosures  thereby really undermining the american dream  it is about whether we as a nation will restore our leadership and our moral authority  bring our constitution out of cold storage  begin to act like americans again  solving our problems  working toward a better future  making it possible for us to be proud of our country  this campaign that we are waging is one of the most important in our nation's history because we are at a turning point  we know that we have so much work to do  and it will take all of us  it's not just about those of us who are running  it's about all of you and everyone else here in connecticut and across america who knows that we can do better  i believe with all my heart that america is ready for an election that sets a new agenda  new priorities  that gives us back that confidence and optimism that should be our birthright  i believe that america can solve any problem that we put our minds to  i believe that we can once again be a nation that sets the pace  that creates the innovation and the future awaits  but i believe that we've got to do that by making it very clear what we stand for and what we won't stand for  i think it's imperative that this election be about the real concerns of the american people  as nancy said  some people think politics is a game  it's exciting  you can have rallies like this  we have so many people outside and we are moving them into an overflow room and that's really a great way of demonstrating involvement and participation  but at the end  it's about are people better off when we stopped than when we started  does some child who didn't have health care before have it now  does some hard working man  who has given his all to his job and has seen it moved offshore  feel like he has any hope left  some working woman who gets up at the crack of dawn and works as hard as she can  ever get equal pay for equal work  these are the kinds of concerns and issues that i care about  i have been in and out of the homes and workplaces and community centers of americans across our country  and what they want to talk to me about is the insecurity they feel  the fears that they are confronting  i am sure that the president tonight will  as he has for the previous seven years  say that the state of our union is strong  but with all due respect mr  president  you're not on the road with me  come and meet the people that i meet  listen to the stories i listen to  sit at tables in diners and hear what's on america's mind  i have very different beliefs than the current administration  i believe that everybody in america who's willing to work hard for a living should bring home an income above the poverty line  i think that should be part of what we hold out for people and make sure that they have  i believe health care is a moral right  not a privilege for the few and the wealthy  i believe people have the right to organize and bargain collectively and have better wages and working conditions  i believe that our education system is not just about our children taking tests but unlocking their imaginations and their potential  i believe our tax code should be fair to the middle class  it's the middle class that built america  it's the middle class that creates most of the wealth and the jobs in america  and its time that we have a tax code that reflects that again  i believe that an investment manager on wall street making fifty million dollars a year should not pay a lower percentage in taxes than a teacher in hartford making fifty thousand dollars a year     i believe that anyone who wants to move a job from connecticut overseas should not get one penny of tax payer help to do it  there should not be any giveaways in our tax code to create jobs somewhere else than america  i believe every child deserves a chance to make it in life  that's why we need a universal pre kindergarten program  that's why we need more help for families  so that they can get their own children off to a good start  i believe we have to start over from scratch with no child left behind and get back to having a partnership between our teachers and our students and the rest of us  i believe that college should be affordable for middle class and working families again  i believe we've got to do more to help those who don't go to college  the young men and women who build the buildings we work in  they deserve more job training and apprenticeship programs for a better future  i believe that we've got to restore the constitution of the united states  we've got to respect our civil rights and our civil liberties  we have to respect the right to privacy and we have to say no loudly and clearly to those like president bush and vice president cheney who don't understand american history or american values  i believe we can do better than what we've seen the last seven years with the cronyism and the corruption and the no bid contracts and the indifference and the incompetence  i believe we can actually start appointing qualified people to the positions we ask them to hold in the government again  i believe we can restore american leadership and moral authority in the world  beginning with ending the war in iraq and bringing our troops home within sixty days of when i become president  i believe that when a young man or woman signs up to serve our country in the united states military  we sign up to serve that young man or woman  we owe them the health care  the compensation  and the support and services that they have earned  i believe that we are strongest when we lead with our values  we have the greatest military in the world  there's no doubt about that  but military force should be used only as a last resort  not a first resort  that is something we have to make clear to the rest of the world again i believe we can work with other countries to find common ground  i believe that the rest of the world is holding its breath  waiting for a new day  i believe that we can have a new energy policy that is focused on clean renewable energy  that puts millions of people in connecticut and across america to work in making and delivering that new energy  i believe we can take on global warming and we can do it in a smart way and the united states can be a leader again in coming up with a framework that includes china and india and other countries in helping to save our planet and at the same time see the result in new jobs and new technologies and new exports  i believe we can have trade agreements that honor labor and environmental standards and that are enforceable against countries that violate them  i believe we can get back to fiscal responsibility where  once again  the united states is strong  we're not going into debt for the war in iraq and tax cuts for the wealthiest of americans but instead we are taking care of the needs of our people at home  if we move back toward fiscal responsibility we will regain our fiscal sovereignty  right now we borrow money from chinese to buy oil from saudis  that is not a good deal for america  i believe we can do better than that  i believe that the next election is not just about who gets elected  i believe the next election is about the next generation  it's about all of these young people who are here today  it's about your future  your potential  the country and world you will inherit  so how do we translate our beliefs into action  how do we go from a campaign where we make speeches  where people stand up and cheer and clap loudly  into making what we believe real  i think it starts by having an election about what matters  about what we can do together  i have spent a year talking very specifically about my plans   what i will do to create more jobs and return to fiscal responsibility and growth  and lifting people out of poverty and giving them a chance to fulfill their god given potential  about how we will have health care by opening up the congressional plan that is there for members of congress and their staff and federal employees to every single america who wants it and give tax credits for those who can't afford it on their own  i know that we have to change our education program from the federal level and i know that we've got to create a better partnership between washington and connecticut and hartford and all of the other communities here  we can do this  there is so much yearning in our country to be part of something bigger than ourselves again  we can provide a really positive view of our future together and we can ask everybody to be a part of it  it's not just about electing a president and passing legislation through the congress  it's about what each and every one of us will do  if we have a new energy and global warming strategy in america then we're all going to have to conserve more  we're going to have to be more energy efficient and look for ways in our schools and our businesses  and our communities to really take on this challenge  i think we're up to it  there's never been a challenge america hasn't met once we made up our minds to do it  i'm going to work very hard to get us to universal health care  it is long overdue in america and we are going to make it possible for people to get health care coverage for mental health  which should no longer be left out and stigmatized  for prevention that will keep us healthy and well  but then i'm going to ask all of us to do more to stay healthy and to help each other and young people will lead the way to give us that encouragement  so that we can be as strong as possible  when it comes to education  i want families to invest more in their own children  i've done this work  as dick was saying  for   years  a family is a child's first school  parents are child's first teacher  most parents really want to know what to do  but there's not a lot of help out there  is there  we need to give more support to families so that they can be the best possible teachers and parents  we need to have work to be friendlier again  i am so proud of chris dodd and what he did to make sure the family and medical leave act was passed after trying for seven years with two presidential vetoes  we need to work to expand it so that more people don't have to make these really tough choices between being a good employee and being a good family member  we've got to relieve a lot of the pressures that so many families feel today because we have care givers taking care of chronically ill spouses or parents or children  they do it for love  they do it because it's the right thing to do  if they stop taking care of each other tomorrow  we'd have to find   billion a year to replace the care that is given out of love  let's start helping families be the best they can be to take care one another  if we are serious about family values  let's start valuing families and giving everybody the tools they should have to make the most out of their family lives  then i'm going to ask all of us to do more to stay healthy  i will do everything i can to make college affordable with new tax credits for families  with more pell grants  with higher levels so that more people can take advantage of them  i want to give two more years of national service to those who need to earn money to go to college  up to   a year so that you can pay your way if you graduate with debt  if you are willing to do a public service job like teaching or nursing or firefighting or law enforcement  we will forgive your debt because of what you are giving back to our society  but the doors of college are not just open by saying   just open  they are open because people work hard for it  we are in a competition in america  we are not only competing between states  we are competing with other countries  each of our young people have to be poised and ready to play a part in this global competition  nobody can out compete americans once we  again  make up our mind that we are going to be in this  to make it clear that we are leading  we are the innovators  we are the entrepreneurs  around the world  we need to have a bipartisan foreign policy again  a lot of the problems we face are not republican or democratic problems  we have to repair all the relationships that have been damaged by president bush  on very continent across the globe  that's why it is so important to start withdrawing our troops from iraq  i have said  as soon as i could  upon taking office if i am so fortunate to do that  i would ask the secretary of defense and the joint chiefs of staff and the security advisors to give me a plan to begin  i think we can bring out one to two brigades a month  i believe we will tell very clearly by our actions  not just our words  the iraqi government that they now have to take responsibility for themselves  something they have been avoiding and denying for five years  then when we bring our sons and daughters home  we will take care of them  it has been heartbreaking to see the neglect and the warehousing that has gone on  we have thirty thousand young americans who have been injured or wounded in some way  visible and invisible alike  it's time that we  as a country led by our president  say we will do whatever it takes  we will fully fund the va  we will provide outpatient services  we will clear up the backlog of disability claims  we will help our veterans get jobs  we will have a new  st century g i  bill so that these young men and women will get money to go to college and start up a business and buy a home  i'm excited by what we can do  we will bring the country together not just by hoping and wishing and talking about it but by making it happen because we set goals we will achieve together  there will be a role for everybody to play  yes  the state of the union speech will be delivered tonight  but when that is finally over it will be time for all of us to turn our attention to picking the next president  on january  th    the next president will be sworn in on the steps of the capitol  i am so honored and humbled to be in this race because i believe with all my heart that our country can do better  it will have to start on day one facing all of the challenges that will be waiting in the oval office  but it will also be able seizing opportunities to chart a new course  if you will stand with me  if you here in connecticut will support me on february  th  i promise you that i will get up every single day and wage a winning campaign against whomever the republicans nominate  i've been up against republicans for a very long time now  i was thinking the other day  wouldn't it be nice if they just announced that they were embarrassed about what happened to the country and they weren't going to run for the white house again  somehow i don't think that is going to happen  i think we will have to wage a vigorous and winning campaign  since i have been on the receiving end of their incoming fire for all of these years and much to their dismay  i am still standing here  i think i know how to take us to victory in november  let me ask you   are you ready for change in america  are you ready for an economy that works for everybody  are you ready for universal health care  are you ready for an education system that keeps faith with our students and our teachers  are you ready to reform our government so it works for all americans again  are you ready to end the war in iraq and bring our troops home  if you are ready for change i am ready to lead and with your help that is exactly what we will do  thank you and god bless you "], ["clinton", "thank you so much  oh  my goodness  thank you  thank you  florida  thank you  florida democrats  you know  i could not come here to ask in person for your votes  but i am here to thank you for your votes today   applause  this has been a record turnout  because floridians wanted their voices to be heard on the great issues that affect our country and the world  i am thrilled to have had this vote of confidence that you have given me today  and i promise you i will do everything i can to make sure not only are florida's democratic delegates seated  but florida is in the winning column for the democrats in   i want to thank my friends  congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz  and congressman alcee hastings  mayor manny diaz  and my great friend of so many years  senator bill nelson  you know  this has been an intense election because people really care about what is happening to our country  so many of the people who talk to me every single day are worried about the economy  they're worried about their health care  they're worried about their college education for their children  they're worried about whether we can restore our leadership and standing in the world  well  i am convinced that  with this resounding vote  with the millions of americans who will vote next tuesday  we will send a clear message that america is back and we're going to take charge of our destiny again   applause  i am so grateful to the countless floridians who  on their own  organized  worked hard  talked to your friends and your neighbors  you made a very big difference  and we know that  as we move forward in this campaign  all of your voices will go with me  because i am not only going to take my   years of experience to the white house  i'm going to take your voices  your concerns  your hopes  your dreams  we have a lot of tough decisions to make  but we're americans  we can make these decisions  we can meet our challenges and seize our opportunities if we start acting like americans again  we roll up our sleeves  we set about solving our problems  and i want to ask you  do you agree with me  because here is what i believe  i believe everyone who works full time in america should bring home an income that lifts that person out of poverty and gives them and their children a better chance   applause  i believe that every  inaudible  child has a right to quality  affordable health care  i believe that every child has a god given potential that we could help to develop if we have universal pre  kindergarten and we have a school system that is not so worried about giving tests as about making sure our kids can learn   applause  i believe that our tax system should be fair for everyone  it is wrong that people making   million a year on wall street pay a lower percentage of their taxes  inaudible  time for us to begin to bring our troops home from iraq as carefully and responsibly as we can   applause  i believe it is important we do everything to promote better relations in our hemisphere with all of our neighbors and that we continue to support democracy in cuba   applause  and i believe that we can  working together  feel pride and progress in our country again  you are giving me a tremendous gift  not only with your votes  but with your trust  because i believe that public office is a trust  and i will get up every single day worrying about you  your families  your future  i think it's time we again had a president who put the american people first  and that is what i will try to do  so thank you  thank you for this tremendous victory tonight  thank you for all you did to make it possible  stay with us  because  starting tomorrow  we're going to sweep through the states across our country to february  th  and we will together not only take back the white house  but take back our country  thank you all  and god bless you "], ["clinton", "good afternoon  this is  as every day is  the day that the lord hath made so let us rejoice and be glad in it  it is a great honor for me to be here with all of you today  i want to thank dr  shaw for his leadership  i want to thank reverend thurston for his  as well  dr  t  dewitt smith jr  for his stewardship and leadership and dr  p t robertson  these four leaders  bringing people together today  deserve our appreciation and our prayers  it is a challenging but necessary endeavor  i should begin by acknowledging that my husband is a baptist and i have learned during our marriage from sitting around the kitchen table that baptists have quite the tradition of disagreement  bill and i have been talking and debating since we first met over thirty five years ago  sometimes the decibel level can rise  depending on the passion of the moment  but as you know  that is how we learn   by exploring our differences  by coming to understand that what we share is so much bigger than what separates us  that is how we come to a place of unity and that is what you are doing here  this week  i understand that this is only the second time that the four conventions have come together as one  you are here guided in the spirit of hope by the one who is faithful to us in all things  as we gather today i am reminded of the scripture from hebrew  which tells us   let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess  for he who comes is faithful and let us consider how we may serve one another on towards love and good deeds  let us not give up meeting together   as some are in the habit of doing   but let us encourage one another and all the more as you see the day approaching  i grew up in a different faith tradition  as a methodist  i know there is at least one bishop from my tradition here who came to show solidarity  i appreciate that  much like all of you  i was taught from a very early age that my faith carried with it certain obligations  it was my youth minister who took us to see dr  king preach about our responsibility to our fellow citizens  it was that famous sermon  staying awake though the revolution  it transformed my life as it did so many others who had the great honor to hear directly from dr  king the calling to be more than on our own  any of us could be  i have been a praying person  luckily  my entire life  i'm often asked whether or not i am  i am quick to tell people that i was raised by parents who were prayerful and by a church that guided me but had i not been a praying person  one week in the white house would've turned me into a praying person  everyday i try to act on the lessons of my faith  to reach that higher place  yet  so often  like all of us  i fall short  but each new day  i keep striving and praying to work harder  to correct my imperfections  to improve on the day before and on the day before that  that's what i've tried to do in my personal life but also in every aspect of my public life  that's how i try to go about the work of breaking barriers and expanding opportunities  work that i  myself have benefited from throughout my life  that is how i practice my faith  i'm living by the scripture that says we are all members of god's household  that we are called  not asked  not urged  not requested  nor ordered  but called to love one another as jesus has loved us  now  i'm not talking about love that comes easy  i'm not talking about the greeting card kind of love  i'm talking about the kind of love that is hard  the deeper  more powerful love in corinthians that bears all things  believes all things  hopes all things  endures all things  i'm talking about the kind of love that we have seen in action  the love that fills the heart of my friend  congressman john lewis  a man that lead the march in selma that ended with tear gas  hoses and the crack of the nightstick against his skull as he knelt down to pray  as he knelt down the pray  that nightstick came up and down on a praying man's head  that was just one of the many times john was attacked on his journey for justice  but those of us know john lewis know that he doesn't harbor hate in any fiber of his being  that's the kind of love i'm talking about  i'm talking about the love that fills the heart of president nelson mandela  i've had the honor of getting to know him over the years and i attended his inauguration  i will never forget how he stood up on that stage and said how proud he was to welcome all of the dignitaries in attendance  but there were three people he especially wanted to welcome  then he asked three of his jailers from robin island to stand  after twenty seven years in prison at hard labor  he invited them to share that day  he later told me that   i knew if i didn't leave my bitterness and hatred behind  i'd still be in prison  that's the kind of love i'm talking about  our faith calls us to do what is hard  to give voice to the voiceless  to lift up the poorest of the poor and the sickest of the sick  but for the past seven years  our leaders have gotten wrong  they've gotten it upside down and backwards  they have given corporate tax breaks to wall street and then cut head start  child care and drop out prevention  they have lifted up the drug and insurance companies  but vetoed health care for millions of children in need  they have given tax breaks to the oil companies but cut off home heating assistance for our seniors this winter  they have waged a war in iraq that has taken more than   of our sons and daughters  but they also regret the poverty  the disease and violence that afflict our brothers and sisters here at home and around the world  every day you perform good work rooted in the values of our faith  isn't it a shame when we have leaders that talk a lot about values  but then go and do exactly the opposite in betrayal of those same values  it reminds me of what the writer  elie wiesel  once observed  the opposite of love is not hate  it is indifference  and for the past seven years  that's what we have seen in washington  an epidemic of indifference  a collective turning of our government's back on the least among us  it is in every way possible the opposite of love  when our children attend schools that are separate and unequal in the  st century  when anyone votes on a broken machine and their vote isn't counted  that is the opposite of love  when we see nooses hung in a school yard  when the screams of selma and montgomery are clouded by the nightmare of katrina and rita  that is the opposite of love  when some members of god's household have every advantage while others are shut out of the circle of opportunity  that is the opposite of love  while we may have an income gap and a health gap  and an achievement gap  there is one thing we don't have   a potential gap  it is time we gave every single child in this country the chance to live up to his or her god given ability and potential  that is what i have strived to do for   years  with your help we will continue to make that real  it is time to reach out and embrace those of the margin and in the shadows  to usher them back to speech at the table in god's household  to ensure that their voices are once again heard in this country  too many of our fellow citizens feel invisible  they come to up to me  as a woman did today in little rock  and said  senator  what am i to do  i can't get the cancer treatment for my chemotherapy anymore  i can't afford it and they won't pay for it  it's keeping me alive and now i don't know where to turn  or the man who stopped me the other day in new york and said  i'm about to lose my job  i've got two children to send to college  where will i get the help  people feel like their deepest concerns  their love of their families  can no longer any matter to those in the highest positions of power  scripture tells us we cannot just be  hearers  of the word we must be  doers  we are told that faith without works is dead  i have lived long enough by now to know that works without faith is just too hard  if you cannot dip into that righteous stream and replenish your soul  it is overwhelming  isn't it  as i look at the work yet to be finished  i believe we are all called upon to be both hearers and doers  we are called to face the inaction  to deliver real solutions to the real problems that our people are facing  that is the affirmation of our love  i often taught a sunday school class when i was in arkansas  and we talked and talked a lot about loving ones neighbor as oneself  i was struck by how absolutely brilliant jesus was  we really can't love someone if we don't love ourselves  can we  if we don't believe in and have respect for this great gift we have been given  it's hard to reach out and love someone  a neighbor  a friend  then of course to be called upon to love ones enemy seems totally unrealistic in the world we live in  it's hard enough getting through the day  but it is what we are called to do  we have to put that calling into action  not only in our individual lives but throughout our society  let us think about the solutions we can bring about  to give our people hope  but more than hope  results  the tangible evidence that they are no longer invisible  but that their needs  their hurts  their wants  are being tended to  when i say solutions  i mean expanding the earned income tax credit and tying the minimum wage to the congressional wage so that congress cannot get a raise until the american people do  especially those who do the hardest work  every day  i mean investing in clean renewable energy and creating create green collar jobs right here in atlanta and across america  jobs that cannot be outsourced  jobs that we can train our young people to do  jobs that will move our dependence on foreign oil and give us a chance to give our economy  our environment  our security once again under america's control  i believe we need to make it abundantly clear that no one that works full time in america should bring home a wage that keeps that person and his family below the poverty line  anybody willing to work a fulltime job should have accommodation of income and benefits that lifts them up  that's how we build a strong middle class  when i say solutions i mean tuition tax credits  to open the doors of higher education  more grants  more opportunities for national service so that students can earn money to go to college  when i say solutions  i mean tax credits to open the doors of higher education  more pell grants  more opportunities for national service so that students can earn money to go to college  i mean doubling the funding for historically black colleges and universities like morehouse and spelman and clark atlanta right here  these have been a bridge to the middle class for generations of young people  that bridge has a sign on it   you can not enter if you don't have the money  that isn't the way it used to be  some of us are old enough to remember as i am  i got a loan from the federal government when i went to law school  it was about   interest so when i graduated i wanted to go work for the children's defense fund and work for marian wright edelman  i didn't want to go to work for a big law firm  i wanted to defend the abused and neglected kids  the kids in the foster care system  the kids without health care and education  but if i had been graduating with tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt  i'm not sure i could have done that  we need also to offer to young people who graduate with debt the opportunity to do a public service job like teaching or nursing or law enforcement and let them pay off their loans over time so they don't become an indentured servant to these student loan companies that hold them in the thrall of predatory interest rates  opening the doors of college is not only good for the young people who walk across that bridge  it is essential for the future of our country  when i say solutions i mean health care for everyone   no exceptions  no excuses   every man  woman  and child to have quality affordable health care because that's the only way we can close the infant mortality gap  close the life expectancy cap  ensure that people get the primary care from a doctor not from an emergency room  when i say solutions i mean fixing this housing crisis because a house is more than just your greatest source of wealth  it's the center of your family  it's where you make memories and develop relationships  no one should take that away from you because of the subprime abusive practices that so many mortgage lenders engage in without any supervision or oversight from the federal government  we've got to have a moratorium on home foreclosures for ninety days so we can help people stay in their homes  and let's freeze those interest rates for five years so they don't keep going up and forcing more and more people into debt  into foreclosure  and let's put a cap on the interest rates that credit card companies can charge and tell them they've got to start explaining to people in big print  not little print  what the terms and conditions are  no one should force you into an ocean of debt because your health care costs are going up  your education and energy costs are going up  but your wages aren't  the average american family has lost   in income in the last seven years  african american families have lost   contrast that with what happened during the nineties when the typical family  including african american families  saw a rise of   in their income and more people lifted out of poverty than in any time in our countries recent history  we know how to turn this around but we have to come together to seek common ground wherever possible and to stand our ground whenever necessary  and if we truly love our brothers and sisters  our sons and daughters  then we will end this war in iraq that has claimed so many of their lives and injured tens of thousands of them  and we will care for them when they came home  because i believe if you serve our country  our country should serve you  and you should get the health care  the compensation  the jobs that you deserve  every day in america hundreds of thousands of our veterans are homeless  are jobless  are being turned away from treatment and health care because there's no space for them  i think we've got to do everything we can to make it clear that we will tend to our veterans starting with our youngest veterans with a  st century g i  bill of rights for money for college  and home ownership  and a business  all the way back to our oldest veterans  let's pay particular attention to the vietnam veterans who fought and served during that conflict who did not get the help and the services that they had earned  and we will restore our moral leadership in the world to ensure that we never fight a war like this again  will all of this be easy  of course not  will we get it done all at once  no  but we will make our greatest efforts  just as all of you have done  that is at the heart of what brings you together   your work every day on the front lines of our communities addressing some of our most difficult challenges  poverty and hunger  hiv aids and disease  disaster relief and so much more  it is a role that your churches have played throughout our nation's history  our churches have served as a bedrock of our community  a refuge in times of need  the heart of our great movement for justice  you cannot have the right kind of change without justice  change happens whether we want it or not   that is a part of life  what we must be committed to is change with justice  change that makes a difference in the lives of every single american  we know that we have a lot of work to do but i come before you with the hope that this great nation that we love  that has given all of us so much  whose struggles  trials and tribulations over the centuries have both broken hearts and inspired us  that we will once again begin acting like americans  there isn't anything our nation can't do to heal up the wounds that have been inflicted  make it possible for each and every person to again feel he or she counts  we can do this  we can lift up the spirits of those most in need  and our country deserves a president who rolls up his or her sleeves and joins you as a partner in that work  that is what i wish to do  to work with you to spur not just each other but all americans towards love and good deeds and to renew the promise of this great nation  thank you and god bless america "], ["clinton", "thank you so much  tonight  we are hearing the voices of people across america  people of all ages and of all colors  all faiths and all walks of life  people on the day shift  the night shift  the late shift with the crying baby  moms and dads who want a better world for our children  young people who deserve a world of opportunity  all those who aren't in the headlines  but have always written america's story  after seven years of a president who listens only to the special interests  you're ready for a president who brings your voice  your values  and your dreams to your white house  tonight  in record numbers  you voted not just to make history   but to remake america  people in american samoa  arkansas  massachusetts  new jersey  oklahoma  tennessee  and the great state of new york  on just one really serious note  we want to keep the people of arkansas and tennessee in our prayers  they suffered horrible tornados tonight  we just talked to some of our folks there and people have died in both states  and our thoughts and prayers go out to them in this moment of their need  tonight thought is your   tonight is america's night  it's not over yet  because polls are still open in california for a few more minutes  i hope all of you will join our campaign at www hillaryclinton com because you know   you know that politics isn't a game  it's not about who's up or who's down  it's about your lives  your families  your futures  it's about the people who have shared their problems with me  looking for solutions  the mother whose insurance company wouldn't pay for her child's treatment  the couple so determined to send their daughter to college  they're willing to mortgage their home with a sub prime second mortgage  the man who asked me what to do after training the person who will take his job in another country  the veterans who come home only to find they don't have the healthcare  the compensation  and the services they need  it's also about the people who want to seize america's opportunity  it's about the unions and businesses who are training people for green collar jobs  it's about the auto companies and auto workers who want higher gas mileage cars so we can compete with the rest of the world  it's about our scientist and researchers who want to be able to do stem cell research right here in the united states of america  it's about our contractors and construction workers who want to get to work to rebuild america from the bridges in minnesota to the levies in new orleans  for seven years  we have seen president bush's answer  they don't know what's at stake in this election  but we do  we know what we need is someone ready on day one to solve our problems and restore our opportunities  because when the bright lights are off and the cameras are gone  who can you count on to listen to you  to stand up for you  to deliver solutions for you  well  the republicans want eight more years of the same  they see tax cuts for the wealthy   and they say  why not some more  they see nine trillion dollars in debt   and say  why not trillions more  they see five years in iraq   and they say  why not a hundred more  well  they've got until january       and not one day more  now we know the republicans won't give up the white house without a fight  well let me be clear  i won't let anyone swift boat this country's future  together we're going to take back america because i see an america where our economy works for everyone  not just those at the top  where prosperity is shared and we create good jobs that stay right here in america  i see an america where we stand up to the oil companies and the oil producing countries  where we launch a clean energy revolution and finally confront the climate crisis  i see an america where we don't just provide health care for some people  or most people  but for every single man  woman and child in this country   no one left out  i see an america where when a young man or woman signs up to serve our country  we sign up to serve them too  an america with a  st century gi bill of rights to help veterans go to college  buy a home or start their own businesses  i see an america respected around the world again  that reaches out to our allies and confronts our shared challenges   from global terrorism to global warming to global epidemics  that's the america i see   that's the america we will build together  i am so lucky to have the most extraordinary staff  volunteers  and supporters  and i am so grateful for all those long hours and late nights that you've been putting in  and i want to thank the most important people in my life  first bill and chelsea  for their incredible love  they have done so much day in and day out and i want to thank all my friends and family  particularly my mother  who was born before women could vote  and is watching her daughter on this stage tonight  i also want to congratulate senator obama for his victories tonight  and i look forward to continuing our campaign and our debate about how to lead this country better off in the next generation  because that is the work of my life   that is why i started my career fighting for abused and neglected children  children who have drawn the short straw in life  because this nation gave me every opportunity and we can do the same for every child  we must continue to be a nation that strives always to give each of our children a better future  a nation of optimists who believe our best days are yet to come  a nation of idealists holding fast to our deepest values  that we are all created equal  that we all deserve to fulfill our god given potential  that we are destined for progress together  it is the ideal inscribed on the base of the statue of liberty in this great city  that has overlooked our harbors through wars and depressions and the dark days of september   the words we all know that give voice to america's embrace   give me your tired  your poor  your huddled masses  yearning to breathe free    a constant reminder that here in america  we face our challenges and we embrace all of our people  so today we say with one voice   give us the child who wants to learn  give us the people in need of work  give us the veterans who need our care  we say give us the economy to rebuild and this war to end  give us this nation to heal  this world to lead  this moment to seize  i know we're ready  thank you all and god bless you "], ["clinton", "hello virginia democrats   that sounds so good  let me ask you something  are you ready to take back the white house and take back our country  well  so am i and i am so ready to see virginia in the winning democratic column in november  i am delighted and honored to be here with you this evening  i want to thank delegate jennifer mcclellan for not only that introduction  but her commitment to public service and leadership  and it is a special treat to be here with governor tim kaine and former governor mark warner  current richmond mayor and former governor doug wilder  i want to thank you so much for sending jim webb to the senate  and i hope he will soon be joined by the next senator warner from the state of virginia  i want to acknowledge your congressional delegation  congressman moran  and scott  and voucher  and the executive director of the party amy reger who has done a wonderful job with this huge jefferson jackson day dinner  now let me ask you for a moment to imagine that it is finally january       somebody standing on the steps of the capitol will place his or her hand on the bible and be sworn in as the  th president of the united states  our task tonight is to make sure that president is a democrat because after   long years of george w  bush    years of incompetence  corruption and cronyism    years of government of the few  by the few  and for the few  the next president will face tremendous challenges  as the president walks into the oval office  waiting there will be   wars  an economy in trouble  the health care crisis  the energy crisis  all of the problems that i hear about every day from people across america  people who whisper to me about the mortgages they can't afford  the medical bills that wiped out their life savings  the tuition bills that cut short their children's dreams  people who work the day shift and the night shift because they want the world for their children  people whose names don't make the headlines but who have all re written america's story  it's about the woman who grabbed my hand and told me her insurance company wouldn't pay for the treatment her child needed  it's about the man who asked me what to do after his job was shipped overseas and he was told to train his replacement  it's about the couple so determined to send their daughter to college that they mortgaged their home with a subprime mortgage and now may lose that as well  it's about the dedicated government employees who stop me and tell me that they are working hard despite the all out assault on government workers by this administration  for me  politics isn't' a game  it's not about who is up  or who is down  it's about your livers  your families  and your future  and isn't it about time you had a president who brought your voice and your values to your white house  this election is also about all those americans who want to seize this moment  to build the kind of future that we know awaits  it's about teachers determined to see their students succeed in this new century and young people  hungry for opportunities their parents never dreamed of  it's about the businesses and unions training people for green collar jobs  the high wage  high skilled  high energy jobs of the future  it's about the scientists and researchers who want to do stem cell research and find treatments and cures for devastating diseases  it's about our contractors and construction workers who want to rebuild america from the bridges in minnesota to the levees in new orleans  it's about the men and women who wear the uniform of our country who deserve a commander in chief who knows they are magnificent but that force should be used as a last resort and not a first resort  for   long years we have neither addressed our problems  nor seized our opportunities  we have tried it president bush's way   concentrate wealth  hoard power  disregard science  shred the constitution  smear dissenters  impugn patriots  go it alone in the world wherever you can and cooperate only when you have to  and now with senator mccain as the likely nominee  the republicans have chosen more of the same  president bush has already put his stamp of approval on senator mccain's conservative credentials and i am sure that will help  now i understand there are some people who say they can't tell the difference between me and george bush  i don't think anyone here believes that the republicans are confusing me and george bush  and certainly  having fought george bush every day for the last   years  i will be among those most happy to see the moving van leave the white house  voters certainly won't have any problems seeing the differences  senator mccain wants to keep troops in iraq for   years  i will start bringing them home within   days of becoming president of our country  senator mccain has admitted he doesn't understand the economy  i have a strategy to end the housing crisis  create   million new clean energy jobs and rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class again  and one thing we know for sure is that senator mccain won't deliver universal health care  in fact i am the only candidate left in this race   democrat or republican   with a health care plan to cover every single man  woman and child  because you see i believe health care is a fundamental human right and a moral obligation of the united states of america finally to achieve for our people  if i'm your nominee  you'll never have to be worried that i will be knocked out of the ring because i do have the strength and experience to lead this country and i am ready to go toe to toe with senator mccain whenever and wherever he desires  i am ready to make the case for the democratic party from universal health care to making it clear that once again america is open for business to the rest of the world  and the era of cowboy diplomacy is over  i am ready to make your case because your voices are the change we seek and together we will take back the white house and take back america because i see an america where our economy works for everyone not just those at the top  where our prosperity is shared and we create good jobs that stay right here in the untied states  i see an america where we stand up to the oil companies and the oil producing countries  where we do launch a clean energy revolution and finally confront our climate crisis  i am well aware that we cannot be serious about our energy policy and our security  our environment  and our economy until the two oil men leave the white house  but when they do  we will be ready  i see an america where we say that   million people uninsured   more than   right here in virginia alone   is a disgrace  and we don't just provide health care for some people or most people  but for everyone with no one left out  i see an america where we have schools worthy of our children starting with pre kindergarten  i know how passionate governor kaine has been advocating for pre kindergarten programs right here in the commonwealth  i see an america where college is affordable again for hard working families  i see an america where when young men and women sign up to serve our country  we sign up to serve them too  an america with a  st century gi bill of rights to help our veterans go to college  buy a home  and start their own businesses  i see an america respected around the world again where we reach out to our allies to confront our shared challenges from global terrorism to global warming to global epidemics  that is the america we will build together  an america where the next generation is always better off than the last  that has been the work of my life  it's why i started my career fighting for abused and neglected children  children who had drawn the short straw in life because i believe all of our children deserve the chance to fulfill their own god given potential  this nation gave me every opportunity and i believe we can do the same for every child  it's a matter of living up to the ideals that our founders  many of them virginians  set forth more than   years ago  that we are all created equal  all entitled to life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness  now neither senator obama nor i   nor many of you in this room   were fully included in that original vision  but it was the beginning of an extraordinary journey  a journey rooted in our ideals when our laws were not  a movement of men and women in each generation  who led us through unchartered territory  to higher ground  the abolitionists like harriet tubman  who told the people she led to freedom ' if you are tired  keep going  if you are scared  keep going  if you are hungry  keep going  if you want to taste freedom  keep going ' the audacious women and a few brave men who gathered at seneca falls  new york  back in   demanding their rights including the right to vote  it took more than   years of struggle and ridicule  and grinding hard work  and only one of them lived long enough to see women pass their first ballot  the progressives who met the inequities of a new age with a new sprit of reform   back in the progressive era  even the republicans understood that we were all in this together  and then we had so much progress during the  st century  and as men and women marched and picketed  as they faced dogs and tear gas as they risked their lives  they did so because they looked into the eyes of their children and they saw the promise of a better future and they decided to just keep going  because of them  my generation grew up taking for granted that women could vote  because of them my daughter's generation took for granted that children of all colors would attend school together  because of them  virginia made history becoming the first state in america to elect an african american governor  governor wilder  because of them  senator obama and i share this stage today and because of them and because of you  less than a year from now  one of us will take the oath of office  and children of today and of future generations will take it for granted that a woman or an african american can be president of the united states  that is the genius of our constitution  it was crafted to expand as our hearts do  allowing each generation to lead us closer to that more perfect union  that is america's purpose  that is our purpose as democrats and our mission in this election   to build a nation that is more inclusive  more equal  more fair  more free  and more just  that work is never finished but we get better as we go  always striving to heed the words inscribed on the base of the statue of liberty  the words that give voice to america's embrace  give me your tired  your poor  your huddled masses yearning to breathe free  lady liberty has overlooked the new york harbor through wars and depression  and through the dark day of september   a constant reminder that here in america we face our challenges and embrace all of our people  so today we say with one voice   give us the child who wants to learn  give us the people in need of work  give us the veterans who need of care  give us this economy to rebuild and this war to end  give us this nation to lift this world  to lead this moment to seize  i know we're ready and i need your help  i need your involvement and your participation starting tonight  together we can make history  come join me  come to my website hillaryclinton com  be part of this campaign  work until tuesday when virginia holds its primary because it is not me you're working for  it is you  it is your future  your family  and your beloved country  we have an opportunity together to make history  but not just to change who lives in the white house but to change our hearts  to change our attitudes  to once again know that there isn't

eliot shapleigh  i want to thank the students and the staff of the university  and i want to thank my huge  texas sized steering committee   applause  well  i can't think of any better place to start our campaign for texas than right here in el paso  and i am honored to be an honorary miner   applause  and we're going to sweep across texas in the next three weeks  bringing our message about what we need in america  the kind of president that will be required on day one to be commander in chief to turn the economy around  i'm tested  i'm ready  let's make it happen   applause  you know  there's a great saying in texas   you've all heard it    all hat and no cattle  well  after seven years of george bush  we need a lot less hat and a lot more cattle  texas needs a president who actually understands what it's going to take to turn the economy around  to get us universal health care  to save hardworking americans homes from foreclosure at the abusive practices of the mortgage companies  we have a lot of work to do  and i know that el paso understands that picking a president is one of the most important jobs we're going to do in this country in the next couple of weeks  when i think about texas  i think about  as the congressman said  coming here   years ago  i was working for the democratic national committee  and i was going along the border registering voters  and we had the greatest time  i met some of the best friends that i've ever had in my life  we had a chance to go into people's homes  we ate a lot of great food   applause  we listened to some wonderful music  and we registered a few voters  too  well  here i am back in texas  and i'm asking the children of those voters to vote for me for their future   applause  you know  some people  when they run for a political office  they only think about the next election  but i like to think about the next generation  because that's what i think this election is about  it is about what kind of country and world we're going to pass onto the young people who are students here  to that beautiful young boy who came up and gave me the flowers  for each of our children and grandchildren  are we going to give them the same shot at the american dream that many of us were given  well  if we make the right decision in this election  we sure are  we're going to give our young people not only confidence and optimism  but real results   st century solutions for what we need to do to fix our problems  meet our challenges  and seize our opportunities  as i travel around the country  i know from what people tell me that a lot of really hard working folks are concerned  you know  they're working as hard as they can  but they don't feel like they're getting ahead  they're not getting the kind of health care and educational opportunities that they want for themselves and their children  i hear the mothers who tell me they don't know what they're going to do because they can't afford health care  and they have sick children  and the only place they have to turn to is the emergency room  i've been in the homes of families that are on the brink of losing the american dream because they got sucked into one of these subprime mortgages and they can't afford to stay in their home  they're looking for somebody to say this was wrong and we will help you  i meet the people who work hard every single day but can't pay their energy bills  they can't fill up their gas tank  they're looking for answers  and then i meet all of the people who want to solve the problems  the young people who are focused on a better future and want to make it happen   applause  there isn't anything america can't do if we make up our minds to do it  every once of us  every single one of us knows that tomorrow can be better than today  but it doesn't happen just by wishing it or hoping for it  it happens by working really  really hard to make it a reality to give everybody a better chance   applause  i see an america where everyone willing to work hard has a job with a rising income  and if you're willing to work full time  you have wages that lift you out of poverty  i want to make sure every american who works full time has a minimum wage of at least    applause  in fact  i would require that congress cannot raise its own salaries unless it raises the minimum wage   applause  i see an america where health care is a moral right  not a privilege  where every man  woman and child has access to quality  affordable health care  we can do this  we can have a uniquely america solution  we already have a plan that we can make available to everyone  it's the plan that provides health care to members of congress  and it works well for members of congress and our staffs and federal employees  it has lots of choices  i want to make sure you have the same choices as your member of congress does   applause  and we will help people pay for it because i want everybody  everybody  to have quality  affordable health insurance  and i also see an america where we end our dependence on foreign oil and we start growing and making our own energy right here in texas and america   applause  aren't you tired of paying those exorbitant costs at the gas pump  aren't you tired of sending billions of our dollars to countries that turn around and use it against us   applause  well  why don't we get smart and start creating our own energy  we have the sun  we have the wind  we can grow the products  we can turn what we have here in texas into the energy of the future   applause  i think that if we do this we will create millions of new  good jobs  jobs with rising incomes  jobs that will be right here in el paso  right here in texas  jobs that will give a family a good potential opportunity to raise their kids  and send them to school  and feel like they're part of the american dream  energy can be the key that unlocks our economic future  makes us more secure in the world  and  if we do it right  we will begin to deal with the problem of global warming  which is a real problem that has to be attacked   applause  you know  i see an america where children are better prepared before they ever go to school  where we help families prepare their own children  where we have a universal pre kindergarten program  so that  year olds can get off to a good start  i see an america where the federal government doesn't tell the teachers  and the principals  and the superintendents in el paso what they're supposed to teach and what they're supposed to test   applause  i will the end the unfunded mandate known as no child left behind   applause  and  together  we will come up with a  st century educational system for our children  where we look at each individual child and try to decide what we need to do to lift that little boy or girl to his or her god given potential  that is the purpose of education  not test after test after test after test after test   applause  i see an america where every young person who is willing to work hard will be able to go to college  they will not have the door slammed in their face because of the costs of higher education  in my america  we're going to make sure that the federal government gets back into loaning people money at a low interest like they did when i went to school instead of the student loan companies   applause  we're going to give young people the opportunity for national service so that you can earn money to go to college  one year of national service  you can earn up to   that would give you the resources to be able to go to school  it is wrong in america when families have to mortgage or sell their homes to send their sons or daughters to college  it should be an investment we all make in you  i see an america where we finally have comprehensive immigration reform with a path to earned legalization   applause  of course  we're going to have secure borders  we're going to work very hard on that  and  yes  we're going to make sure employers don't exploit undocumented workers   applause  and we will do more to help communities like el paso that need resources for health and education and law enforcement  and i want to work more with our neighbors and friends to the south to help those countries create more jobs for their own people  so that everyone would have a chance at a better life   applause  but we're going to bring people out of the shadows  we're going to tell them that  if they meet certain conditions  like paying a fine for coming here illegally  like paying back taxes  like learning english  we're going to give people a path to citizenship  because so many of the people who are here work hard  send their children to school  and deserve a chance at the american dream   applause  you know  i see an america where we  once again  are builders and architects of our future  where we're investing in all of the different kinds of transportation and physical buildings that are required  we need more roads  we need more bridges  we need more tunnels  we should be putting millions of americans to work building the  st  century america  investing in that richer and brighter future   applause  and i see an america where we know that we have to be respected around the world again  where we have to repair our reputation  where we have to work with other countries to solve our problems   applause  i have said that  when i become president  i will begin to put a plan into place to bring our troops home starting within   days   applause  many of you are veterans  you know that planning to withdraw our troops has to be done carefully and responsibly  but we must start  our young men and women who serve our country have done everything they were asked to do   applause  they have performed bravely and heroically  but there is no military solution  it is up to the iraqis themselves to make the tough decisions about their country's future   applause  so as we bring our sons and daughters home  let's take care of our veterans  let's give our veterans the services  the health care  the other programs that they so richly have earned  because when someone signs up to serve america  america signs up to serve that veteran   applause  i want to be sure that all of our veterans  from our youngest to our oldest  get taken care of  i'd like to see our youngest veterans get a  st century gi bill of rights  with money for college  and money to buy a home  and money to start a business   applause  and as a president  president bush has not done what needed to be done for our veterans  we haven't funded the va  we have so many coming home who are injured and not being taken care of  i think it is the highest obligation of the president  who is also our commander  in chief  to take care of those who have served our nation  and i pledge to you i will take care of our veterans  i will make sure our youngest veterans get what they need  we will honor our oldest veterans from world war ii  and i want to pay special attention to the veterans of my generation who served and fought in vietnam  to give them what they deserve to have   applause  you know  every problem we face can be solved because we're americans  we are problem solvers  we are the people who are constantly creating the future  we believe that tomorrow not only can be  but will be better than today  and we have to keep faith with these young men and women to make sure that they have the opportunity to pursue their own dreams  so this election could not be more important  and there are some real differences that have to be sorted out by the voters of texas  one of the biggest differences between me and my opponent is that i believe with all my heart that we must have universal health care  that we must do everything possible  finally  to realize the dream of democratic presidents going back to franklin roosevelt and harry truman  now is the time when we will achieve this goal  we cannot give up on it  we cannot back down from it  senator obama won't come forward with a universal health care plan  but i have  i will  and with your help we will achieve universal health care in america   applause  another difference is that i want to stop the foreclosures of peoples' homes  i want to give people a chance to work out a way to stay in their homes  the home is the most important refuge that any of us have  isn't it  and too many people are being forced out of their homes across texas because of abusive mortgage practices  predatory lending  and it's not just affecting the people who lose their homes  it's affecting the people who live next door or down the street  because a vacant home lowers property values for everyone  so i have been saying let's have a moratorium  let's freeze interest rates  this is a very big deal  because we can't fix the economy if our home market doesn't start working again   applause  and so i was somewhat amused today when president bush and his secretary of the treasury said they were actually going to do some of what i've been urging them to do for several months  let's try to save people's homes  i am a problem solver  i believe that we need a president  starting on day one  who's going to roll up his or her sleeves and get to work   applause  because i want you to imagine for a minute what is waiting for our next president in the oval office in the white house  you know  on january     our next president will be sworn in  and waiting on that desk in the oval office are two wars   two wars   an economy in trouble  a health care system that is not taking care of people  an energy reliance on unstable regimes  and all of the problems that comes from that  so many of these challenges are going to be just sitting there  waiting for the next president  and some people say   well  there's going to be a lot of work to do  well  there is going to be a lot of work to do  but are we up to doing that work and taking our country back   applause  now  i am so excited to be making this campaign  but i can't do it without all of you  i need you here in el paso and across texas to stand up for me  because   applause    because if we stand up together  if we work together  if we fight together  we will take back america  and we will make history together  thank you all  and god bless you "], ["clinton", " i remarks as prepared for delivery below i  i am so pleased to be with all of you  as some of you may know  i grew up in the midwest  so being here today sure feels good  this state has always held a special place at the heart of our nation  ohio was one of our first frontiers   and has always led us to new ones  you gave us the airplane that first graced the skies and the astronauts who explored the heavens   including my friend and hero  senator john glenn  the steel from these mills armed america through two world wars  put cars in our garages  and built our cities rushing skyward  for so many years  this state has defined our values  expanded our horizons  and kept the american dream alive  but at the beginning of this new century   here in youngstown and across this state   the american dream is being tested  some jobs have left  others pay less  so you just work harder  health care  energy and college costs are up   so you stretch your budget further  maybe you're a working mom or dad raising your kids   and also a working son or daughter caring for your parents   and you feel overwhelmed  maybe your kids grew up  had to leave the state to find work  and took the grandkids with them  some days  it probably feels like the perfect storm  you fill up your tank  and that's two twenties from your wallet  you pick up a gallon of milk and a few other things   and there goes another  you try to fill your child's prescription  and they tell you   sorry  that's no longer covered  after a while  you feel like a human atm   with all the money going the wrong way  that's why i'm here in youngstown   because that's what this election is about  it's about you  it's about your lives  your dreams  your future  i know that here at gm  you've had serious losses  but we can't ever give up on our manufacturers and manufacturing jobs  no one should ever have to leave their family to earn a living  in the end  it comes down to just one question  when the bright lights are off and the speeches are over  who can you count on to listen to you  to stand up for you  to deliver solutions for you  for the past seven years  we've seen this president's answer  he delivers perks for the special interests on a silver platter   one that was probably made in china  with president bush  every day is valentine's day for the special interests  they've grabbed tax breaks at every turn  exploited every loophole  and turned federal departments into their revolving doors  and while you pinched pennies to stay within your budget  the president has blown the bank on tax breaks for his friends and no bid contracts for his cronies   borrowing hundreds of billions from china to pay for it  he's essentially signed a subprime mortgage on america's economy  so when people ask me   why can't we get tough on china  i ask them   when was the last time you got tough on your banker  china's steel comes here   our jobs go there  we play by the rules   they manipulate their currency  and we get tainted fish  lead laced toys  and poisoned pet food in return  for seven long years  we've had a government of  by  and for the special interests   and we've had enough  it's time to get real about our future  it's time to level the playing field against the special interests and deliver  st century solutions to rebuild the middle class  it's time we made the solutions business america's business  today  i'm announcing an agenda to reign in the special interests and save the american people at least   billion a year  money that can go back into your pockets  money we can use to create new jobs  rebuild our infrastructure  make college affordable and so much more  we'll take on the oil companies and harness their record profits to create millions of clean energy jobs   high wage jobs you can raise a family on  i'll end their special tax breaks and give them a choice  invest some of your profits in alternative energy  or we'll do it for you  people have been paying through the roof at the pump  and it's time the companies paid their fair share  we'll take on the credit card companies so that you and your families aren't drowning in debt  here in ohio  payday lenders are actually taking social security checks from our elderly  that's outrageous  i've proposed real consumer protections against abusive interest rates   capping them at no more than   and working to get them far lower  and i'll ban those hidden fees and sudden rate hikes  because credit card companies shouldn't be able to bait and switch you and your family  we'll take on the insurance companies and tell them they can no longer discriminate against the sickest people who need care the most  they spend more than   billion a year trying to figure out how not to cover people  well  i'm going to save them a fortune and a whole lot of time  because here's the new policy  no more discrimination period  so even if you have a pre existing condition  you can get the health insurance you need   no questions asked  and i'll go after drug companies and insurance companies that are overcharging consumers and the government   it's time to end their profiteering at our expense  we'll take on wall street and tell them  you're going to finally pay your fair share in taxes  because it's outrageous that a teacher making   pays a higher tax rate than some wall street investment managers making   million  and i'll create a bi partisan corporate waste commission to review all those corporate subsidies   and propose a comprehensive way to end them  we can save billions of dollars a year and put it to work for you  we'll take on the student loan companies and tell them no more ripping off our sons and daughters  i'm proposing a student borrower bill of rights   no more deceptive advertising and outrageous fees  and we'll end the inefficient subsidies for private student loan companies  because we should be making it easier for our kids to go to college   not harder  we'll send a loud  clear message to all those companies shipping our jobs overseas  if you're trying to take jobs away from ohio  no more loopholes and no more tax rewards  i think we've had enough of this administration using our tax dollars to encourage companies to outsource our jobs  and let's support the people who work those jobs  let's raise the minimum wage  let's support our unions by standing up for the right to organize and appointing people to the department of labor and national labor relations board who are actually pro labor  i'm proud of what our unions do to serve this country every day  i commend the building trade unions for their  helmets to hardhats  program that places our veterans in all kinds of jobs   here in ohio and across the country  that is truly patriotism in action  i am proud to have the support of more than a dozen unions representing six million working families nationwide  sheet metal workers  sanitation workers  stage hands  machinists  bus drivers  farm workers  letter carriers  painters  teachers  nurses  childcare workers  law enforcement officers  bricklayers and so many more  i'm proud to be labor's candidate  when my opponent puts out a mail piece with all sorts of false claims about my position on nafta  working men and women know the truth  you know i've been working to help create good jobs in new york and across america  that i have plans to create five million new  green collar jobs  and that my opponent doesn't have much experience creating jobs at all  and you know that i'll crack down on unfair trade with countries like china  i've already proposed legislation to assess trade agreements every five years to see if they're meeting their goals or if they need adjustments  and when i'm president  we will take a timeout from new agreements in order to create a new approach  one that is genuinely pro american  pro worker  pro environment   and vigorously enforced  i think it's time for a president who works as hard for you as you work for america  a president who knows what manufacturing means to america  let's be honest about something  when president bush and vice president cheney say the economy is booming even though   million manufacturing jobs have been lost  when they propose to cut the manufacturing extension partnership  when they cut assistance to small manufacturers  when senator mccain tells you business as usual on trade is just fine and tells neighboring michigan workers that we can't bring new manufacturing jobs back to the united states   they are sending you a clear message  they do not believe america needs a strong manufacturing base  they think america doesn't need to make anything anymore  they think those of us who remember how our manufacturers helped defend our freedoms in the great wars are just quaint and nostalgic  they think it would be just fine if every plane  every piece of machinery  every computer  every car were made somewhere else  well let me be clear  i believe manufacturing matters  i believe we should be restoring the manufacturing extension partnership   not cutting it  i believe a strong america needs a strong american manufacturing base   and i intend to fight for one as president  some may call this the  rust belt  but that's not what i see  i see some of the hardest workers in the world  i see great universities and strong communities  i see a  st century manufacturing belt  an innovation belt  an opportunity belt  i see a middle class comeback that starts right here  right now   in places like this  now  over the years  you've heard plenty of promises from plenty of people in plenty of speeches  and some of those speeches were probably pretty good  but speeches don't put food on the table  speeches don't fill up your tank  or fill your prescription  or do anything about that stack of bills that keeps you up at night  that's the difference between me and my democratic opponent  my opponent gives speeches  i offer solutions  it's one thing to get people excited  i want to empower you to live your dreams so we can all go forward together  there's a lot of talk in this campaign about what kind of change we'll bring  well  change is going to happen whether we want it or not  the question is who will make progress  my opponent says that he'll take on the special interests  well  he told people he stood up to the nuclear industry and passed a bill against them  but he actually let the nuclear industry water down his bill   the bill never actually passed  on top of that  the same company that watered down that bill lobbied for dick cheney's energy bill  and my opponent voted for the energy bill  with its billions of dollars of breaks for the oil industry  i voted against it  my opponent says he'll stand up for workers  he often talks about the plight of maytag workers in his home state  but the union at that plant supports me because when   jobs were being lost  they say he didn't do a thing to help  my opponent says to cut health care costs more aggressively than i do  but as an independent analysis from the commonwealth fund shows  the most effective way to lower costs is to truly cover everyone  his health care plan does''t  mine does  i was  however  glad to see that yesterday  my opponent adopted the goal of five million green collar jobs   months after i announced i would create five million green collar jobs  i was also glad to see that he modeled his   billion infrastructure bank on a bill i co sponsored last summer to create a   billion infrastructure bank  now  if only he would just copy my health care plan and provide coverage for every single american  so there's the difference between us   speeches versus solutions  talk versus action  in all seriousness  while some may think that words are change   i know that it takes work  you can't just talk about the special interests   you have to take them on  i always have  and i always will  if you want universal health care  you have to take on the insurance companies   that's exactly what i did as first lady  and when we weren't successful  i kept on fighting until we got health care for six million children  i took on the drug companies to get vaccines for children   and today  childhood immunizations are at an all time high  so i've stood my ground against the special interests  but i also know how to find common ground in the senate  bringing together democrats and republicans to solve our toughest problems  i'm the co founder and co chair of the bipartisan senate manufacturing caucus  where we've worked to revitalize america's manufacturing base  i created new partnerships to breathe economic life into struggling cities and towns in upstate new york  we brought new investors  new capital  and funds for infrastructure and economic development  that's how i measure my life   not by applause or headlines   but by whether i'm helping people  i'm in this race because this nation gave me every opportunity  and i believe we can do the same for every family  that's been the purpose of my life   standing up for people who weren't getting a fair shake  people aspiring for a better future  people who need government on their side  and it will be the purpose of my presidency  so yes  today the american dream is being tested  but it's been tested before  tested by war and depression  communism and terrorism  discrimination  division  and fear  and that dream has always triumphed  it has grown stronger as each generation has made it their own and made it more real for more people  it takes leadership and hard work  but we've never been short on either  so i hope you will join me in delivering the solutions we need for our nation's economy and making sure our best days are yet to come  when the people of ohio and america work hard and work together  there is nothing we can't accomplish  thank you and god bless you "], ["clinton", "thank you  thank you all very  very much  it is wonderful to be with you  i want to thank gerry mcentee and tom buffenbarger  i want to thank your congressman tim ryan  also  i want to recognize representative ron gerberry  representative linda bolon  representative lorraine fende  representative sandy harwood  i also want to thank shelley murray  the school board president  and amy litkey the student rep to the school board  and i particularly want to thank the cheney high school and east high school marching bands  well  hello  youngstown  how are you tonight  i am thrilled to be here with all of you  and  it is great to see this enthusiasm and this energy  tonight  i want to talk to you about the choice you have in this election and why that choice matters  it is about picking a president who relies not just on words  but on work  on hard work to get america back to work  that's our goal  you know  when i think about what we're really comparing in this election  you know  we can't just have speeches  we've got to have solutions and we need those solutions for america  we have got to get america back in the solutions business  because  while words matter  the best words in the world aren't enough unless you match them with action  but  this election is not about me or my opponent  it is about you  it's about your lives and your dreams and your future  i can't do this without all of you here in youngstown and across ohio  it is going to take an effort from all of us  you may have heard that i actually loaned my campaign some money and i was honored and humbled by the support that i have received since from people like the young mom who sent me   and wrote that  my two daughters are two and four and i want them to know anything is possible  or the gentleman who described himself as an independent voter  a veteran and a generally cranky conservative who decided to support me  if we put pull together  i know we can do this  i hope you will go to and support this campaign because it is your campaign  i hope you will go to my website  because if you do  you'll find at hillaryclinton com all of my positions  everything that i have been working on  because i know what's happening in america  people are struggling  they are working the day shift  the night shift  they are trying to get by without health care  they are just one paycheck away from losing their homes  they cannot afford four more years of a president who just doesn't see or hear them at all  they need a president ready on day one  to be commander and chief  ready to manage our economy and ready to beat the republicans in november  with your help  i will be that president  this is the choice we face  one of us is ready to be commander in chief in a dangerous world  every day  around the world  situations arise that present new threats and new opportunities  situations like the change of leadership in cuba today  i have served on the armed services committee  i have been to more than   countries  worked with world leaders  stood up to the chinese government to declare women's rights are human rights  and i am ready to end this war in iraq  end this era of cowboy diplomacy  i will restore our leadership and moral authority in the world without delays  without on the job training from day one  one of us has a plan to provide health care for every single american  no one left out  i believe  i believe health care is a right  not a privilege and i will not rest until every american is covered  that is my solemn promise to you  the question is  who would we leave out  do we leave out the mother i met who grabbed my arm and said the insurance company wouldn't pay for the treatment that her son needed  will we leave that family out  who will pay for those we leave out  i don't want to leave anyone out  i am not running to put band aids on our problems  i am running to solve our problems  one of us has a plan to actually address the growing foreclosure crisis which is so terrible here in ohio  i've called for a freeze on subprime foreclosures and interest rates to ensure that millions of families across the country won't be receiving that grim letter from the bank  i've proposed   billion in assistance to help families avoid foreclosures and to help communities rebound from this housing crisis because no one should foreclose on the american dream and we're going to stop it  one of us has a plan to revitalize our economy right now by creating millions of new clean energy jobs  and we can do that right here in youngstown  we can put people to work  and i will also rein in the corporate special interests by eliminating more than   billion of george bush's special breaks for the oil companies  the drug companies and wall street  we're going to give the middle class a break instead  we'll put that money right back in your pockets once we get it back  the corporate special interests have had seven years of a president who stands up for them  i think it's time we had a president who stands up for you and i will be that president  finally  one of us has faced serious republican opposition in the past and one of us is ready to do it again  the contrasts between me and our likely opponent on the republican side could not be starker  senator mccain is willing to continue the war in iraq for   years he said  i will start bringing troops home within   days  he admits he doesn't understand the economy  well  i have a plan to turn our economy around and create five million new jobs and we can  we can do that working together  senator mccain really wants eight ears more of the same  well  i'm going to deliver  st century solutions that will move our country forward again  we'll focus on the problems right here in ohio and begin to solve them  both senator obama and i would make history but only one of us is ready on day one to be commander in chief  ready to manage our economy and ready to defeat the republicans  you know  only one of us has spent   years being a doer  a fighter and a champion for those who need a voice  that is what i would bring to the white house again  that is the choice in this election  after the past seven years that choice couldn't be more important because for seven long years we've had a government of  by and for the corporate special interests  they have been heard first  they have been heard loudest and they have drowned out everyone else  and while you pinch pennies to stay within your budget  the president blew the bank on tax breaks for his friend and no bid contracts for his cronies  borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars from china to pay for it all  he has signed a subprime mortgage on america's economic future and that's your future  and so when people ask me  why can't we get tough on china  well  when was the last time you got tough on your banker  and so we have to get back to fiscal responsibility in order to get tough on china because we shouldn't be borrowing so much money from them  china's steel comes here and our jobs go there  we play by the rules  they manipulate their currency  and we get tainted fish  lead laced toys and poisoned pet food in return  i think that's a pretty raw deal  don't you  let's be honest about something  when president bush and vice president cheney say the economy is booming even though three million manufacturing jobs have been lost  when their administration says outsourcing is a plus for our economy  or when senator mccain that business as usual on trade is just fine  when he thinks making tax cuts for the wealthy permanent is a top economic priority  they're sending you a clear message the struggle of middle class and working families simply don't matter  your voices just don't matter  they think the economy works as long as it works for their friends at the top  when good jobs leave  they think that's just the price of admission to the global marketplace  they think it would be fine if every plane  every piece of machinery  every computer and every car were made somewhere else  i could not disagree more and don't you also youngstown  some people may call this the rust belt but that's not what i see  i see some of the hardest working people in the world  i see great universities and strong neighborhoods and families  i see communities where young people should be able to find good jobs and no one should ever have to leave their family to earn their living  i see a  st century manufacturing belt  an innovation belt  an opportunity belt that will once again put us on the forefront of the world's economy  i see a middle class comeback that starts right here and right now in places like this  places just like youngstown  in youngstown  you have start up companies thriving as a new business incubator  places like warren where the gm plant i visited is  you are leading the way and producing the fuel efficient cars of the next generation  places like akron where cutting edge manufacturing jobs and technological innovations are really attracting and keeping highly skilled young workers  let's start working together to build the america that we believe in and let's level the playing field against the corporate special interests  we're going to deliver  st century solutions to rebuild the middle class  let's get real about our future starting right now  let's get real about the future of trade in this country  let's get real about nafta   it simply isn't working for all americans  i'm not just going to talk about what's wrong with nafta  i'm going to fix it and i have a four point plan to do exactly that  first we'll have the strongest possible labor and environmental standards in the core nafta agreement  second  we wont let foreign countries undermine worker protection as they do right now  these companies can challenge american regulation intended to protect american workers and the environment  that is not acceptable and i will change that  i will strengthen nafta's enforcement mechanisms to remove trade barriers and better protect american jobs  and finally  we'll review this agreement and every other trade agreement regularly  if it's not raising living standards right here in america and protecting american workers  then we're not going to have it be a race to the bottom  we will never again let fourteen years go by without updating and modernizing our trade agreements  my opponent has taken to attacking me on nafta  the fact is neither of us were in the senate at the time and i've long been a critic of the shortcomings of nafta  in   when we were both in the senate  senator dorgan proposed amendment that i thought was just common sense  it said that our trade negotiators shouldn't enter into any agreement that undermines basic protections for american workers  it said we shouldn't allow foreign countries to unfairly dump their products into the american marketplace in a way that damages u s competitiveness  so i stood with american workers and i voted for it  senator obama stood with the bush administration and voted against it  that is a big difference between us  my opponent claims to stand up for workers   he often talks about the plight of the maytag workers in his home state  but the union at that plant supports me because when   jobs were being lost  they say he didn't do a thing to help  we're also going to get tough with china  otherwise we'll keep losing jobs  the currency manipulation has to stop  the trade barriers have to come down  china is going to have to be our trade partner  not our trade master  we're going to level the playing field  it's time that we make trade work for working families  that's why i opposed fast track authority for george bush  because we can't allow him to ram through deals on his way out the door  when i am president  we will take a time out from new agreements until we have a trade policy that is genuinely pro worker and pro american  no one will get away with violating our trade agreements anymore because we'll start enforcing them vigorously and without fail  let's get real about creating jobs right now  good jobs that pay the bills because our families can't wait another minute  manufacturing because a strong economy and strong military require a strong manufacturing base  green collar jobs   five million of them   jobs we'll create by investing oil company's record profits in clean renewable energy  how about ending their special tax rates  you've been emptying your wallets at the pump  isn't it time they paid their fair share  let's get real about keeping jobs right here in ohio and america where they belong  as president  i will send a loud and clear message to any company shipping jobs overseas  if you take jobs away from the families of youngstown  you'll pay a price because when i am president  you will never again be able to use our tax dollars to help outsource our jobs  finally  let's get real about supporting the working men and women of this country again  i'm proud to be here with so many of my friends from labor  i'm proud to have the support of more than a dozen unions representing six million working families nationwide  sheet metal workers and sanitation workers and machinists and bus drivers and farm workers and letter carriers and painters and teachers and nurses and child care workers and law enforcement workers and brick layers and so much more  i am proud to be a pro labor candidate because i always tell people if you want to know how america got its great middle class  how we got fair wages  how we got benefits and a shot at the american dream   because of unions  because they stood up  they spoke out and they refused to back down  people sometimes ask me  when you are president will labor have a seat at the table  here's my answer   labor built that table  you better believe labor will have a seat at the table  in the end  this election comes down to one simple question  when the speeches are over and the cameras are gone  who can you count on to listen to you  you know you can count on me to stand up for you and to deliver solutions for you  if you know one thing about me it is this   when i say i'll stand up for you i will and when i say i'll fight for you  i will  that is what i've always done  it's what i've done fighting for universal health care  we didn't succeed at first but i didn't give up and we're going to keep fighting  we got six million kids insured  we're going to get other kids insured and we're going to get universal health care when i am president of the united states  right here  that's what you are doing in youngstown  i know everyone in this room knows someone who has lost a job  maybe you're that person and i know how hard that is  but you're still here  you're still fighting  you're not going to give up on this community and neither am i  i'm in this race because this nation gave me every opportunity  i believe we can do the same for every family and every child here in ohio and across america  ohio was one of our first frontiers  it has always led us to new ones   you gave us the airplane that first raced the skies  you gave us the astronauts who explored the heavens  including my friend and hero senator john glenn  you gave us steel from the mills that armed america through two world wars  you put cars in our garages  you built our cities  you created those sky scrapers rushing skyward  and here in ohio  you always dreamed big about the future  now it's time to fulfill those dreams  the question is not whether we can build the future we want  it's whether we will  it is whether we will  here's my answer  we will create good jobs  we will provide health care for all  we will leave the next generation better off than the last  we will end this war  we will bring home our troops  we will take care of our veterans and serve them as honorably as they have served us  and yes  with your help  we will shatter the highest and hardest glass ceiling because that's what we do in america  we break barriers  we open doors  we make sure every voice is heard  it will take leadership and hard work but we've never been short on either so i hope you will join with me  together we will seize this moment  lift this nation and  once again  lead this world to peace and prosperity  thank you and god bless you "], ["clinton", " b hrc b  it's great to be home i schumer intro i   b hrc b  wow  thank you so much  it is great to be here with all of you and it is wonderful to be here with my friend and colleague  our great senator chuck schumer who knows a few things about wining elections  i want to thank all of the hosts who have made this event possible and so successful  i want to thank maya days  i want to thank hunter college and particularly president raab  and i want to thank my friends  all the elected officials who senator schumer has recognized  our labor leaders  our civic leaders  and mostly all of you for being here with me this morning  this is a great opportunity for me to say thank you  thank you to the people of new york  thank you so much for everything you have done  i want to congratulate senator obama on his victories yesterday  he's had a good couple of weeks and he's run a good race  we will be squaring off in primaries in two weeks  we're going to draw the contrasts and make the comparisons and give the people of ohio and texas and other states a real choice  campaigns are not supposed to be easy  they're supposed to be hard  they're supposed to be challenging  there isn't any more important campaign than the campaign for the presidency of the united states because it is the toughest job in the world  i'm asking the people of america to hire me for a job that requires an enormous amount of effort and determination and resolve  it is about the future of our country so i am looking forward to traveling throughout the states that are upcoming to make my case because  obviously  i believe that this is the most important election in a very long time  we've got to be focused on what kind of choice we actually have before us  i don't need to tell this audience or anyone in new york for that matter that we've had seven years of drift and detour from america's destiny  we have had failed policies  wrongheaded approaches to every issue you can imagine here at home and around the world  and we are paying a terrible price from iraq to afghanistan  from new york city to l a  the people of this country deserve so much better than george w  bush and dick cheney  our economy is waning  not gaining  hardworking americans are losing their jobs  they're losing their health care  they're losing their homes  so much of the pain and insecurity is directly related to the failure of leadership directly from the white house  we have seen  time and time again  how president bush and the republicans have undermined the greatness of america  have disregarded our values  put our constitution in cold storage  come back and ruled with fear and fatalism   that is not america at our best  we're going to once again demonstrate who we are  what we stand for and take back our future  but it is time to get real   to get real about how we actually win this election and get real about the challenges facing america  it's time that we moved from good words to good work  from sound bites to sound solutions  americans have a choice to make in this election and that choice matters  it's about picking a president who relies not just on words but on work  on hard work  to get america back to work  to get america working again for all of our people  we need to make a choice between speeches and solutions  because while words matter greatly  the best words aren't enough unless you match them with action  this is becoming more apparent every day  my good friend congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones from ohio represented me on one of the tv programs in the last day or two   some of you may have seen her  and she was on against someone representing my opponent and for the first time  actually  the host  asked the representative of my opponent to name one accomplishment  that is all we're asking  we're asking to compare our records  we're asking to compare our years of service  we're asking to compare our ideas  our solutions  because it's not just about my opponent and myself  this election is about you  it's about what you can expect  what your dreams will be  what your futures hold  right now too many people are struggling  working the day shift and the night shift  trying to get by without health insurance  just one paycheck away from actually losing their homes  they cannot afford four more years of a president who just doesn't see or hear them  they need a president ready on day one to be the commander in chief of the united states military  i will be that candidate and i will be that president  this is the choice we make  one of us is ready to be commander in chief in a dangerous world  everyday around the world  situations arise that present new threats and new opportunities  situations like the change of leadership in cuba and the elections in pakistan  i've served on senate armed services committee  i've represented you and our country in more than   countries around the world  i've worked with leaders  i've stood up to the chinese government on women's rights and human rights  i am ready to end this war  end the era of cowboy diplomacy and restore our leadership and moral authority in the world without delays and without on the job training  one of us has a plan to provide health care for every single american with no one left out  no excuses  no exceptions  i believe health care is a moral right  not a privilege and i will not rest until every american has access to quality  affordable health care  and i cannot wait until i can work with the chairman of the ways and means committee  our own charlie rangel  my opponent leaves out at least   million americans  the question is who would you leave out  would you leave out he man who called me from northern new york who had an insurance policy that wouldn't pay for the operation his son needs  or the woman who called me from long island who couldn't get bone marrow transplant for her daughter  or the mom who said  what am i going to do with my son who has congenital heart problems and we don't have insurance  i don't want to leave anyone out  i am not running for president to put band aids on our problems  i'm looking to solve them once and for all   crowd chants  hillary  hillary  hillary  on issue after issue there are real differences  one of us has a plan to address the growing foreclosure crisis  the other doesn't  one has a plan to revive our economy right now with millions of new clean energy jobs  and one of us has actually taken on the special interests for years and years  standing against hem  fighting against them  making progress against them  finally  one of us has faced serious republican opposition in the past and one of us is really to do it again  of course  the contrast with our likely republican opponent couldn't be more stark  senator mccain is willing to  as chuck said  continue the war in iraq for a hundred years  i will start bringing our troops home within sixty days  senator mccain admits he doesn't understand much about the economy  i have a plan to turn our economy around and create five million new jobs  senator mccain wants more of the same  i will deliver  st century solutions so that we can get off this track towards nowhere that george bush and the republicans have placed us on  both senator obama and i would make history and i am thrilled by that  i have spent my entire adult life working on behalf of civil rights and women's rights and here we are at this moment in american history  but maybe because i understand how difficult this job will be and how lonely it is in the oval office because when all the cameras are gone and the lights are out  when the advisors have all had their say  the president has to decide  we need a president who is ready to do that  only one of us is ready on day one  this campaign is not about a campaign  this campaign is not about a personality  this campaign is about hundreds of millions of americans who are yearning for leadership again  people who across this country do the hard work that makes america work  i've spent most of my life helping people who are trying to make it  i know who you are  you pour coffee in the corner restaurant  you fix people's hair  you ring up the cash register  you deliver the mail  you put out fires and patrol our streets grade papers after your kids have gone to sleep  you stand on the wall late at night defending our nation so the rest of us can sleep  you're the nurses who tend to the sick  the caregivers who care and give  you're the parents on the front lines of daily life  determined to achieve the american dream for your family  you're the foundation  the families  the communities and the country we love  you truly are the miracle that makes america what it is  others might be joining a movement  i'm joining you on the night shift  on the day shift and i'm asking you to join me to shift america into high gear again  to ensure that we build a strong and prosperous middle class  that we do all in our poor into prosperity and opportunity  that we recognize that the divisions among us are nothing compared to the unity that america can have  the results that i've been part of producing for the last   years are rooted in my dreams for a better future  we all carry dreams in our hearts and we need to keep dreaming  dreaming keeps us hopeful  it lifts our spirits  it sets our sights high  without dreams you can't aspire to be great but without action  we cannot turn those dreams into reality  i want you to fulfill your dreams and i want america to fulfill ours  it will take hard work and resolve and determination but there isn't anything we can't do once we set our minds to it  i intend  as your president  to make sure that america does fulfill all of our dreams  i judge the results of my public service on whether people are better off when i stop than when i started  whether our children will be able to live up to their god given potential  whether america is making progress in moving toward that more perfect union that our founders promised  i'm ready to do this work and i'm ready to bring our country together  i know that if we once again start acting like americans  we will see results  we will believe in ourselves  we will feel that pride that comes at the end of hard work that produces positive change  there are big differences in this election between me and senator obama and between me and senator mccain  whether we favor speeches or solutions to move our country forward  or more of the same old republican policies  this is a debate that the voters deserve to have  we cannot achieve unity that lasts  unity that is real  unless we accept that sometimes people disagree  not just to be disagreeable or to play political games but because they have honest and principled differences  people are entitled to defend those strong opinions  but then we've got to come together to reach consensus  to honor our differences and to work through them  we won't achieve unity or fulfill our dreams by running away from honest discussion and debate  we cannot achieve the kind of changes we want by voting present on controversial issues or by meeting behind closed doors with corporate interests to water down legislation or by caving in when the pressure mounts  the american people deserve better than that  so yes  let's get real  let's get real about this election  let's get real about our future  let's get real about what it is we can do together  let's get real about whether or not our young people learn because teachers can teach and not just test  let's get real about whether our brave veterans are given the care and the respect they deserve  let's get real about not just talking family values but valuing families by strengthening the middle class  creating good jobs  proving universal health care  making college affordable  taking care of our senior citizens  my campaign is about an america of shared opportunity  shared prosperity and shared responsibility  i do believe we are all in this together and we are going to demonstrate loudly and clearly that our country is worth fighting for  our country is worth standing up for  and this campaign goes on and this campaign moves forward  and this campaign  with your help  will take our country back  thank you all and god bless you "], ["clinton", "thank you  it's a great personal honor for me to be here with extraordinary leaders of our nation's military forces and to thank them for their long and dedicated service to our country  i am grateful for their confidence in my ability to lead our nation in difficult times  i want to thank my long time friend general clark who served with such distinction and success  i want to thank another long time friend secretary togo west  who not only served the army but also served the veterans affairs department and gave great devotion to our men and women in the military and then when they become our veterans  i want to thank admiral dave stone  general john watkins  general joe ballard  and i want to thank general antonio taguba who showed extraordinary courage in the face of very difficult challenges when he accepted an assignment to lead the investigation into what happened at abu ghraib  i also want to thank all the other veterans  former officers  noncommissioned officers who are here with me and i want to also express my appreciation to all who are supporting me in this campaign  we are here at such an extraordinary moment in american history  the stakes have rarely been higher  i've had numerous historians tell me that america's point in our arch of destiny  today is perhaps most similar to the situation confronting president truman when he became our president and commander in chief  dramatic events during this past week have reminded us how volatile our world has become and how essential it is that we have sound strategy and strong leadership  from kosovo to cuba  from iraq to pakistan  to our embassy being burned in belgrade  these are some of the most challenging spots on our global map  the world is being transformed with enormous risks and possibilities that we must meet with confidence  optimism  resolution and success  the next president will inherit all of these global challenges and more from a president who failed to handle them well  a war in afghanistan and a war in iraq  america's reputation at an all time low  countries rushing to acquire nuclear weapons  crushing poverty that stymies economic and political progress in too many regions of the world  global warming and global health pandemics  genocide in darfur  a rise of borderless  stateless criminal cartels  and the continuing real threat of terrorism here at home and abroad  but while these stark realities carry dangers  they also bring unprecedented opportunities if we act wisely  if we have the right kind of leadership  there isn't any doubt in my mind that we will not only navigate through these uncharted difficult waters but emerge stronger than ever  reasserting both our leadership and our moral authority  the vision i have for america is one that is rooted in those values  values that have served us well but have been temporarily sidelined because of this administration's approach to the world  over the past seven years  we've seen what happens when the president presents the american people with a series of false choices and then is indifferent about the consequences  force versus diplomacy  unilateralism versus multilateralism  hard power versus soft  we've seen the tragic result of having a president who had neither the experience nor the wisdom to manage our foreign policy and safeguard our national security  we can't let that happen again  america has already taken that chance  one time too many  the symbol of our presidency   the american eagle   holds arrows in one talon and an olive branch in the other  both are symbolic tools of what we need to keep our democracy strong and our nation safe  tools that a president must know how to use in the daily course of events  but also when that   a m  phone call comes to the white house because an unforeseen crisis has erupted without warning  in that split second the president has to respond and make a decision that could affect the safety and lives of millions of people here in our country and around the world  whoever sits at that desk in the oval office on january  th    needs all the tools available  all the resources at our disposal  and the wisdom to know how to use them  i propose a new american strategy to restore our moral authority  end the war in iraq  and defend and protect our nation  we need a president who understands there is a time for force  a time for diplomacy  and a time for both  who understands that we enhance our international reputation and strengthen our security if the world sees the human face of american democracy in the good works  the good deeds we do for people seeking freedom from poverty  hunger  disease  illiteracy  and oppression  with me  this is not theoretical  this is very much who i am  what i have done  and what i will do  the american people don't have to guess whether i understand the issues or whether i would need a foreign policy instruction manual to guide me through a crisis or whether i'd have to rely on advisers to introduce me to global affairs  i'm lucky to have had a pretty good inside view  over eight years in the white house and now over seven years in the senate  of what the president goes through day in and day out dealing with all of these challenges  obviously the work that i have done on human rights  democracy  international development gives me a deep appreciation of the importance of winning the hearts and minds of those in societies whether or not they are for us today  i believe that we can seed democracy and create new strong alliances overseas  and i also know from my years serving on the senate armed services committee that our military power is absolutely essential but it cannot be viewed as the solution to every international problem  yes  we must use force when necessary but as a last resort  not a first resort  as one piece of a comprehensive strategy to defend our nation and promote our values  i've been honored to travel to more than   countries representing the united states  in sessions with foreign leaders  with influential citizens from the world of business  academia  human rights and so much else  i have traveled to iraq and afghanistan three times  and i've seen and have said repeatedly that we must revise our strategy in afghanistan  when i first went to afghanistan in   i was met by a soldier who said  welcome to the forgotten front lines in the war against terrorism  i regret to say that those front lines are still largely forgotten  it will take a new policy toward pakistan   one that builds on the democratic yearnings expressed by the pakistani people in elections last week and recognizes that the border areas between pakistan and afghanistan are among the most important and dangerous in the world  ignoring these realities of what is happening on the ground in both afghanistan and pakistan has been one of the most dangerous failures of the bush foreign policy  i have been to africa and have seen how disease  hiv  aids  tuberculosis  malaria   undermine progress across an entire continent  i pushed our government to start battling the global aids epidemic because this affects our security too  i'm very hopeful that we will make progress in africa dealing with the multiplicity of challenges that the continent faces  it was my great honor to go to africa in the mid  s as a precursor to my husband's trip and i applaud president bush and mrs  bush for going back  we need a consistent coherent strategy in dealing with africa and that is something that i will promote  i'm also very proud that the united states joint forces command invited me to be the only senator to serve on the transformation advisory group  which studies and proposes ideas to modernize and strengthen our military  to meet new and emerging global threats  that experience reinforced my commitment to looking at every single challenge we face not through a narrow prism but a broad overview because it is all interconnected   what kind of military we need  what tools we provide our men and women who serve us is directly related to what it is we are trying to accomplish and how best to utilize those resources effectively  i know very well that in exercising foreign policy you have to know both how to find common ground and how to stand our ground  dealing with the rising power of china provides an example  i went to beijing in   and spoke out for women's rights and human rights  the chinese government wasn't happy  they pulled the plug on the broadcast of my speech  but i took that as a compliment  because it was important for the united states both to be represented and to make absolutely clear that human rights is an integral part of our foreign policy and that women's rights is key to that  what we have learned is that where women are oppressed and denied their basic rights we are more likely to have regimes that are more adversarial to american interests and values  today  china is most obviously the world's largest and one of its fastest growing economies  it's become a global superpower that needs to be convinced to play by the rules in the global marketplace  here again  the bush administration has failed  one third of our trade deficit is with china and over the course of the last seven years bush policies have has allowed the chinese government to become our banker  today  china's steel comes here and our jobs go there  we play by the rules and they manipulate their currency  we get tainted fish and lead laced toys and poisoned pet food in return  that will change when i am in the white house because i know we have got to take a consistent approach towards china  i've co sponsored legislation to compel the administration to take aggressive steps to stop china from manipulating its currency  to make our goods look more expensive  i'm the original co sponsor of the foreign debt ceiling act which really means that we would require any administration to begin reversing our trade deficit and start breaking our reliance on china for not only what they provide to us in terms of the way they buy our dollars and buy our debt but also to be held to higher standards for what they import into our market  we have to make sure that american companies have a level playing field when it comes to trade  we're far from reaching that goal  and i think it's imperative that we move because what is happening is that our standard of living in america is deteriorating  that has direct and serious implications for our capacity to operate effectively on behalf of our strategic interests in the world  it's very difficult to persuade the american people that we must continue to lead  that yes  there will be occasions when we have to sacrifice in furtherance of our values and interests if the standard of living  the family income here at home is deteriorating  so this is something that has to be seen as a whole  our fiscal irresponsibility over the last seven years has undermined our ability to be the leader we need to be in the world  you cannot talk about our military and our other objectives strategically and have mired ourselves in debt and dependent upon foreign countries to keep us afloat  that also goes hand in hand with our continuing refusal to have an energy policy that is in line with our strategic objectives  so when we talk about foreign policy  we have to talk about fiscal policy  energy policy and so much else besides just the narrow view that has been primarily driven by the bush administration over the last seven years  so  in order to address these new challenges we do have to set a new tone both here at home and around the world  that requires that we start with the most basic of duties  a commander in chief must protect and defend our nation  on my first day in office  i will announce  as i have repeatedly in this campaign  that the era of cowboy diplomacy is over  that includes the doctrine of pre emptive war  i have been against that for many years  i believe it led us into a blind alley and i don't think i need to remind the retired flag officers here today how difficult the choices made by the president have been for american military  we need a new national military strategy that employs military power wisely instead of squandering it  that requires us to begin to bring out troops home from iraq within   days of the new president taking office  i believe we can redeploy one to two brigades a month but i also believe it will be dangerous  there's been a lot of talk about withdrawal and redeployment and i think it needs to be put into an appropriate context  withdrawing troops is not easy  one does not wake up in the morning and say let's bring them home  it requires planning that looks at every possible contingency  that's why last spring i began pushing the bush administration to tell us what planning had gone on  whether they were ready to bring our young men and women home  they didn't want to talk to us about it  as is their usual response  we finally were able to secure a briefing which although classified  i can tell you was cursory  it did not inspire confidence in our readiness to do this important task of withdrawing our troops and equipment  i think it is also important that we look at what else needs to happen simultaneously  we have   or so american civilians in iraq  they work at the embassy and other government agencies  for businesses and charities  we need a plan for them as well  and we also have iraqis who sided with us  one of the young officers who spoke in the pre program is someone i have known a long time  someone i've known quite a long time  marine captain iscol who began talking to me about the need to take care of those who take care of our troops  translators and drivers  when captain iscol was leading his men in the battle that retook fallujah  he has said  as i've heard other young marine officers who were part of that battle tell me  they would not have survived had it not been for their translators  honor is important  it's important to our country  we are an honorable nation therefore we must do more to take care of those who sided with  protected and saved the lives of young americans in iraq  if i am entrusted with the presidency  america will have the courage  once again  to meet with our adversaries  but i will not be penciling in the leaders of iran or north korea or venezuela or cuba on the presidential calendar without preconditions  until we have assessed through lower level diplomacy  the motivations and intentions of these dictators  raul castro  for example  has a stark choice  he can continue to stifle human rights and economic freedom in cuba  or he can chart a new course toward democratic reform  we need to engage with our allies in latin america and europe to encourage cuba on to the right path  but we simply cannot legitimize rogue regimes or weaken american prestige by impulsively agreeing to presidential level talks that have no preconditions  it may sound good but it doesn't meet the real world test of foreign policy  i have traveled to so many countries working on issues involving some of the most intractable challenges we face  and as we see people respond to their own conditions  we have to be ready to act  the clearest example of that is what just happened in pakistan  the pakistani people essentially repudiated the bush administration's policies and created a new dynamic that could lead to greater freedoms and democracy or to a greater crisis with implications for the war in afghanistan  one thing the american people can be sure of  i will not broadcast threats of unilateral military action against a country like pakistan just to demonstrate that i am tough enough for the job  we have to change our tone and change our course  so let's begin by reviving old fashioned diplomacy  one of my criticisms of the bush administration is that they have such a narrow circle of people advising the president  apparently there is only one diplomat the president will send anywhere and that is secretary rice  so if secretary rice can't get to the middle east or get to pakistan or get to africa or get anywhere  you don't get the feeling that the president is engaged  i think that is a terrible failure  the president needs to have a broad circle of advisers calling upon distinguished americans both in and out of government to serve as presidential envoys  something that i urged when i came back from pakistan and afghanistan last january  i urged the white house to send a high level presidential envoy  i said there is a lot of misunderstanding between president musharraf and president karzai and it is going to cause us problems  that was not accepted by the white house and instead  full support continued for president musharraf as he moved further and further away from democracy  as his strategy for battling al qaeda  the taliban and other extremists proved time and time again to be inadequate  we have a new opportunity now  we need to be supporting those in pakistan from the middle class  from the professions who are our natural allies in order to give american approval to the changes that have taken place in the elections  the more we have people invested in their own futures  the more likely they are to work with us to protect our future  that is what i will attempt to do  it is also important that we revive our commitment at a very public level to human rights and individual freedom  let's close guantanamo  let's make it clear that we will never sanction torture and we will stand for the rule of law  let's build a real coalition of allies to defeat terrorists in afghanistan and other countries that provide a safe haven for al qaeda  let's make it clear that any terrorists who attack the united states  who have safe haven in any country  are putting that country at risk  that is one way for us to demonstrate that we will not be the aggressor  we will not engage in pre emptive attacks  but we will defend our nation  we need  also  to begin to be serious about darfur  everyday we fail to act  the betrayal of fundamental values  the peace keeping force has not been deployed for reasons many of you know  objections by members of the security counsel among others  the united states has to be pushing much more aggressively to get that done  we also do need to lead the world toward a sound energy policy that treats global warming as the crisis it is and not science fiction  i have said that i would meet with the countries that are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions until we hammered out an agreement  hopefully within a year that would china and india who have to be part of the solution  we also need to be moving quickly toward a coming to terms with our oil companies and our oil producing country allies  we need to demonstrate our commitment to home grown energy  we can't do that  i know  until the two oil men leave the white house but as soon as they do  we have to be ready aggressively  we will lead the world in combating aids  i was proud to sign a pledge to invest   billion by   to combat aids across the globe  we will lead the world in standing up for women's rights and i know that this is an issue that goes to the heart of who we are as a nation  because when women continue to comprise the majority of the world's unhealthy  unfed and unschooled  the global community cannot prosper or make progress  when women continue to be raped as a tactic of war  trafficked by criminal cartels  and subjected to violence both in and out of their homes  that compromises the dignity and humanity of the entire human family  we will also lead in providing opportunity to the world's children  when   million children in the developing world don't attend school and   million more drop out before finishing the first grade   that is a recipe for poverty  instability and extremism  that's why i have introduced the bipartisan education for all act    billion over five years for the goal of basic education for every boy and every girl around the world  now  that is the beginning of the security agenda that i would begin implementing within the first   days  we all know that we have a lot of work to do to repair the damage that we will inherit  in this campaign people are offered clear choices  senator mccain is a friend of mine  he is to be commended for his courageous service to our nation during the vietnam war  but in terms of foreign and security policy  in the calamitous wake of president bush  senator mccain can't seem to budge from bush approach that insists on using military force when diplomacy is needed  he has said he wants to keep our troops in iraq  it would be fine with him for   to   years  i will start bringing them home within   days  it's also important that we combine all of our tools  economic aid  humanitarian aid  focusing on issues like disease  children's schooling and women's place  something that i believe i will be much better able to do  senator obama  meanwhile  represents another choice  he wavers from seeming to believe that mediation and meetings without preconditions can solve the world's most intractable problems  to advocating rash unilateral military action without cooperation from our allies in the most sensitive region of the world  electing a president should not be an either or proposition when it comes to national security  we need a president who knows how to deploy both the olive branch and the arrows  who will be ready to act swiftly and decisively in a crisis  who will pursue strategic demands of hard diplomacy to re establish moral authority and our leadership  in this moment of peril and promise  we need a president who is tested and ready  who can draw on years of real world experience working on many of the issues that we now confront  who knows when to stand ones ground and when to seek common ground  who has the strength and fortitude to meet the challenges head on without fear and without sowing fear  i believe i am the candidate most ready today to be that kind of president and commander in chief  i will never let america's good name be disgraced  i will always protect and defend our nation and i will always advance the traditions and values that have made our country  as president lincoln said  the last best hope on earth  thank you all very much  i also want to recognize lieutenant governor anthony brown  an iraq war veteran  the lieutenant governor of maryland  i'm proud to have his support "], ["clinton", " b senator john glenn b  thank you all for being here today and it is great to be back home in southeast ohio  annie and i grew up just down the road in new concord  as most of you are aware  a real pleasure to be here today  i don't think if anything is more appropriate than having an economic summit here  not just because of this part of ohio  but for the whole country  all the things we talk about are going to happen or not happen as the economy of the country dictates on what we can do for the future  that's why it's so important  and i know there are lots of people to give their opinions on this today  we welcome them all here to ohio  it's my pleasure to introduce to you another person from the southern and southeastern part of ohio  our great governor ted strickland who was a minister  a psychologist  and a great new governor  ted strickland   b governor ted strickland b  thank you very much  as the governor of this wonderful state  i am so proud to have so many of our special guests with us today  i'm always happy to present ohio and it's a greatness to people from outside of our state  as i have said many times  ohio is a state that is a microcosm of america  we have incredible diversity in ohio  and we celebrate that diversity  we have the wonderful foothills of the appalachian mountains and we have the great lake erie to the north  we have natural resources that are immense  we have racial and ethnic and cultural and religious  economic and geographic diversity like few other states  ohio is a state with a proud history  ohio and ohioans  senator  have not just built ohio  ohioans have built america  and we are proud of our history  but ohio like many states is facing economic challenges  too many of our families are facing the possibility of losing their homes through foreclosure  too many of our workers have lost and are in danger of losing their jobs  too many ohioans  possibly as many as   million ohioans are without health care insurance or coverage for health care needs  too many of ohioans are deployed in this conflict  more ohio national guard men and women  senator  are deployed today then at any time since world war ii  and we keep them in our hearts and in our prayers  and pray for a speedy recovery and a return to their home  having said that  it is appropriate that the eyes of the nation are focused on ohio  and that we are focused on the economy because i believe we have a candidate in senator clinton who understand ohio and who understands the economic burdens facing our people and our state  i have traveled this state with her  i have sat with her as she has talked with real people facing real challenges  the reason that i am so excited about this event is because i believe ohio wants to hear what is going to be done to create jobs  to expand opportunity and to make a decent life available to the people who live within the borders of our wonderful state  so thank you senator for coming to this part of ohio  and for traveling around all of ohio  we look forward to your leadership today  in the weeks to come  and once you are in the white house  welcome to ohio  senator hillary clinton  i am especially pleased to be here and especially to be with two of your native sons  senator john glenn who is so well known and honored across our country and the world  and your dynamic  effective governor ted strickland  this is a great opportunity for us to talk about not just the problems which people know pretty well for themselves  but what kind of solutions we can put together that will improve the economy  produce more jobs  enable us to keep the jobs that are here  increase the prosperity  make sure young people can stay home near their families in order to make a living  build a strong and prosperous middle class again  so i'm very excited about being here with distinguished guests  you'll meet them in a minute  they come from across ohio and america to be right here in zanesville   the y bridge city  the mayor told me about the y bridge  and i don't know how many y bridges there are  but just another in  that's pretty impressive   b senator glenn b  this is the only one that cars can drive on  the other one is in germany  and it is a pedestrian bridge  this is the only one in the world   b senator hillary clinton b  well that's a great distinction  congratulations  so we came to a place that is already quite unique  here in the y bridge city  to talk about the future  we're joined by distinguished guests from across the state as well as the country  elected officials  leaders from labor and business and education  and some hard working ohioans who you'll hear from  now we may have come from different backgrounds but we're all here with the same purpose  and that is  when it comes to our economy  we know we can do a lot better  i have been across ohio and across america for more than a year  actually going back about   years when i was first privileged to travel extensively in our country  this has been a great opportunity for me to hear firsthand from the people who are worried about their jobs because they've already seen those jobs be shipped over seas  they're worried about losing health care  because they've already seen that health care lost  they're worried about affording college because they've already seen too many young people from too many hard working families who are having a hard time affording the rising costs  they've already seen energy prices go up so fast over the last   years that the average family is paying more then   in energy today then they were in   so people are living with the realities  and they're meeting them with the grit and determination that we would expect from ohioans and americans  but it's time that we had a president who is going to be a fighter and a champion for the american people again  who would get up everyday  who would get up everyday and would say what are we going to do together  to the white house staff and the cabinet and the government and the business and labor leaders in our country  what are we going to today to improve the lives of young hard working americans  what are we going to do to rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class  that is my mission  that is what i would do as your president  i see a middle class comeback and i see it starting in places like zanesville  it won't happen though just by hoping for it  it will only happen if we are determined and we have a plan and we implement it  and we see the results  and that's what i intend to do  i put forth my economic blueprint for the  st century  it includes a lot of the specifics that i've been traveling around ohio talking about  we're going to rein in the corporate special interests  we can take back   billion in tax giveaways that the republicans and george bush have handed out to the oil companies  to the drug companies  to the health insurance companies  we're going to say  wait a minute wall street  you've had your president  now we need a president for main street  and we're going to make that happen  we're going to start investing in manufacturing again  i believe you can't have a strong economy unless you have a strong manufacturing sector  we can't rely on other countries to produce what the american military needs  so it's not only a question for our economy  it's a question for our national security  i believe we could create at least five million green collar jobs with clean renewable energy that would put ohioans to work starting soon  i also know that if we invest in our infrastructure   more bridges  tunnels  roads  water systems  sanitation systems   we would put a lot of people to work and we would upgrade our infrastructure for the  st century  in order to do that  we're going to close every tax loophole that still gives one penny of your tax dollars to any company that exports a job  instead we're going to put that money to work here  we're going to address the home foreclosure and mortgage crisis  you'll hear a little bit about that today  too many ohioans are losing their homes  the numbers are staggering    homes and foreclosures last year    notices went out in january alone  these are a lot of hard working people who thought they were going to right thing  i've said we should have a moratorium on home foreclosures  let's figure out as way to work out keeping people in their homes  instead of having vacant houses in neighborhoods that will decrease property values for everybody  i believe we need universal health care  no exceptions  no excuses  and i know we can achieve that  we do need affordable college again  something that is one of my highest priorities  it is now more expensive for a young person to go to college in america than it was thirty and forty years ago  that's wrong  through a combination of tax credit and aid  reining in the student loan companies that have been acting like predatory lenders  we're going to go back to direct lending to help students afford to go to college  and if they come out with debt  if they are willing to do a public service job like teaching or nursing or law enforcement  we will forgive their debt so that they can be debt free  we're going to start supporting our unions again  because when unions were strong we had a strong middle class  it's not an accident  it's time that working people had a president on their side again  finally  we are going to have trade that lifts up our families  pro worker  pro environment  pro american trade  that's going to be one of my highest priorities  i know that nafta has hurt a lot of ohio's families  that's why i have taken action  i'm the only candidate with a comprehensive plan to fix nafta  and i will also crack down on china's unfair trade practices  including currency manipulation which gives them big advantages over our companies and our country  we're not just here to talk about what i want to do  i want to hear what people have to say about what we can do together  we have an extraordinary group of people  and i want to hear about the challenges that they face  i'm going to ask each person to introduce him or herself because i want your advice  i will be a president  just as i have been a senator  who listens  i think you learn more when you're listening than when you are talking  and what is necessary for zanesville may not be the same as toledo  may not be the same as san antonio  may not be the same as chicago or new york  so we need to look closely at what will work in communities across ohio and america  i think that we've got some great opportunities here  we hear a lot about the problems and they are serious but i believe for every problem  there is at least one solution  we just have to start acting like americans again and roll up our sleeves and actually solve our problems  no more whining  no more finger pointing  let's get to work  i'd like to start our discussion today by hearing from the ohioans who have graciously taken their time out to join us  i want to start with dave cimperman  dave and i met at grace's grill in parma last week  david has worked at general motors for more than forty years  and he sees the economy from the front lines of the work force  i want to ask dave if you can share with us what you see as the key economic challenges facing you and your family   b dave cimperman b  senator  one of the big things that i see is the universal health care  general motors is paying each  is charging   per vehicle because of the health care that they're giving us  they're competing with automobile companies in japan  it's time we got one   b senator hillary clinton b  well  obviously i agree with dave and i'm really happy he mentioned this because there are two very important reasons that we should have universal health care  the first is that it is the morally right thing to do  i do not believe people in our country should be denied access to quality  affordable health care  and the second reason is there is no doubt in my mind  as dave just said  we have lost jobs over the last   years and increasingly over the last seven years where we've lost  in ohio alone    jobs in manufacturing while george bush has been president  and one of the main reasons is health care costs  because as dave said  general motors has to put   of its money into ever car  imagine what a competitive disadvantage that is  other countries don't impose that burden on their companies  and particularly on their manufacturers  so it's economically necessary for us to achieve universal health care  dave  you've been working for general motors for quite some time  are there other issues in addition to universal health care that we have to address   b dave cimperman b  we would like to see a more even trade policies  there are a number of them that we are allowed limited number of vehicles to countries and we take up a lot more coming into this country  i must mention  senator  that the same forty years i worked for general motors  i was also a united auto workers  in the union  i'm still in the union  i'm giving you my opinions  not the union's opinions  but there are many  many members who feel the same way i do  and are backing you   b senator hillary clinton b  thank you  well  i've worked with the uaw for years  and i know that they share your commitment to universal health care and to leveling the playing field so that we have a chance to compete  american workers are the best in the world  we're most productive  we just need to be unshackled so we can compete fairly and that's what we are going to try to achieve  so thank you very much dave  now i'd like to welcome robert landry and beth dlabay  i met them in dayton  and they've driven all the way from dayton to be with us today  on christmas eve  robert and beth lost their home in a home foreclosure  i know what a shock that was to them because i heard them talk about it  but i want to really personalize these statistics  millions of people have lost their homes in the last several years  the bush administration has taken little to no action to try to prevent it  i have a plan to try to stop the home foreclosure crisis  but i want you to hear from robert and beth what it means when you're actually faced with that  robert  why don't you start  can you tell us how this happened to you  and then you and beth tell us how you're managing now   b robert landry b  well  you know  it just starts where you're just doing your thing  you're working  you got a decent job  you're paying your bills on time  all of the sudden you notice one of your payments isn't taken out  you call the mortgage company up and you ask them what's going on  then you find out  they say  it's lost  just wait  okay  then the next thing you know  but what you don't know is you're being marked late  they're hitting your credit and you find out that you've got a predatory loan that's going to reset in a couple months  the next time you try to pay it on time  they do the same thing  they mark you late  then you cannot refinance with a good rate  and you start freaking out  this is your home  your grandkids depend on you  you've got a good job  this can't happen to me  there's laws and you call  you do everything  you write the governor and  not this governor   b governor ted strickland b  thank you   b robert landry b  and he gives me a letter saying it's not within his jurisdiction  i didn't know the law  but i thought well maybe he could make a phone call or something  i don't know  maybe because it's not just me  it's happening to a lot of people  you fill a loan  the bottom drops out of your whole life  you think your doing to right thing  and then it's all over  they give you a number to the bar association  you get a real estate lawyer  you go in there  they say   well i can research it for four hours and write a nasty letter for   and you've already paid some late  they say you were late  they say you have late fees  then you call again  you've got records that your right  you've got everything  you did  your bank gave you print outs for months  you present that to them and they say  no  you're still late  no  you're still late  you still owe us another   from when you first started paying two years ago  or something  you just don't know what to do  the bottom line is  you don't know what to do and you're lost  i finally got a hold of fair housing  miami valley fair housing  and they're non profit and they helped us out  but they made us go through a rigorous interview to get involved in their process  at least after months of them making me go through classes to make sure i could pay my bills  when i already was  they finally agreed to take us on  but they sent out respa letters for me  you're required by law to answer these letters  you're required to stop hitting a person's credit and you have to tell them or every penny went  well  they don't answer them because it's a small fine  it's insignificant compared to the value of your home  so  long story short  we just needed someone to be there for us and we felt lost  we voted  you know  that's the only thing you can do is vote for change and we voted for governor strickland  i almost feel like it worked  my one vote worked because i'm sitting right next to him   b senator hillary clinton b  beth  do you want to add anything to what robert said   b beth dlabay b  it was just really difficult because  in the meantime our granddaughter that was living with us had to undergo open heart surgery and the lender's attorney did not want to wait on us to sign the papers  they just wanted us to sign the papers and get out  well  we had to travel from dayton to cincinnati and find somebody else to take care of our other two grandchildren because she had to have a pulmonary valve put in  they didn't care  if it hadn't been for the miami valley fair housing center i really don't know what we would have done  and there's too many people  they can't even help them  there's a lot more people  we got out of it  we're fine  our granddaughter's fine  we're going to make it  we found another house to live in  we got the kids christmas  we made sure we had a tree up christmas eve even though we had to be out  i got everything ready for them and when we went and got them  they had christmas  that's the important thing  i just wish that miami valley fair housing center could help more people like us but they need the funding  they don't get it  i don't want any other family to have to go what we went through  ever   b senator hillary clinton b  when i first met robert and beth in dayton they had one of their grandsons with them and it was so impressive to me the way robert explained how he'd always paid his bills  he was raised in a family where you're supposed to pay your bills  he sent in the check  and this is one of the many scams that these lenders get away with  where they claim you're late  you can show when you sent it  and they say well we didn't receive it  and you of course can't control when they claim they received it  then they use those late payments to force a higher interest rate on you  force you into refinancing  it's just a terrible abuse that does need to be cracked down on  and robert is right the fine is so small it's worth a lot of these companies just gambling  so i think there needs to be criminal consequences and much tougher fines to rein in these lenders  as beth said  we need more help to the organizations that are trying to save people's homes and i have a proposal where we would put money into doing just that  help communities that are facing a high foreclosure rate  as the governor knows so well  ohio has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country  i think it's like number nine in the whole country  this is a big issue that affects so many families here  we're so lucky to have governor strickland with us because he's been working hard to turn around ohio  and he has lots of great ideas about how he's going to improve the economic lives of people across the state  so governor  i'd like to ask you to tell us what you think are the three most pressing economic challenges that you face as the governor of ohio   b governor ted strickland b  senator  we have huge budget challenges  we passed a budget not many months ago unanimously  every republican and every democrat in the senate voted for it and all but one member of the house of representatives voted for it  although both chambers are controlled by the republican party  we were able to work together to fashion a budget that identified priorities for ohio  we wanted a budget that would provide health care coverage for all of our children  we wanted a budget that would freeze college tuition after ten straight years of annual increases in tuition of   every year for ten years  making ohio   more costly for our young people to go to an ohio public college or university than was the national average  we did some really good things in a very bipartisan way  but the economy's had a downturn  the national economy is affecting what's happening here in ohio  and so i've been faced  just within the last few weeks  of having to make some very painful decisions because we've had to cut over   million out of the budget  these decisions affect real people  real families and real children  so  if i were to give you the three things that i think could be most helpful to ohio and  quite frankly  these are the reasons that i'm supporting you  i've known you for   years but i wouldn't support you if i didn't think you were the best candidate for ohio  in ohio  as is the case in many other states    states are now having to go back and revisit their budgets    states and that number is growing  so  we have huge rising medicaid expenditures in ohio  so if we had a heath care system that could provide health care coverage to everyone in a plan fu  rational way  it would make such a huge difference  i say to people  can you imagine what life would be like if all of us had access to affordable health care  can we imagine the burden that would be taken off the shoulders of moms and dads knowing that their loved ones had access to health care coverage  what it would do to our businesses in terms of making them more competitive if they didn't have this burden  so senator  i believe  and i'm going to sound very political here but i'm going to do it because i think it's absolutely true  i think you are the only candidate that can help us realize a democratic dream  an american dream  since the days of harry truman we've tried to get universal health care coverage for the american people and we've been unable to  we are finally at a place where that can happen  the physicians  the health care providers now know it's necessary  the business leaders in our state now know it's necessary  i think things are coming together  what we need right now is a president that is committed to getting it done  i am convinced that the one thing that could be helpful to all ohioans and to our overall economy is what you will do as president that's bring universal health care coverage to our people  the second thing we need  and i'll be quick  we need jobs  we need jobs  jobs  jobs  jobs  and i'm proposing a   billion bond package that will create jobs in ohio but i know that you're working on that at the federal level  you understand that we've got to start investing in america  we've got to start building the infrastructure that is necessary to repair our roads and bridges and sewer systems and water systems to help local communities build our country  that will create jobs and so that's the second thing  and the third thing is certainly education because education is the ultimate hope for our people and making sure we have a good  high quality educational experience for our children from their youngest years through even graduate work and the adult worker up to the time of retirement  these are the three things that i think ohio needs  i think they're the things that you as president will accomplish  if we can get that done  you become president and you do those three things for ohio  we're going to say you were a pretty good president   b senator hillary clinton b  well  you will have a partner in the white house to really tackle all of these challenges because they're so important  and you've given us a lot to think about  one of the issues that i'd like to get into because it's related to what governor strickland said is both an economic opportunity and a way of giving people a real shot at the american dream that's housing  what are we going to do to provide more housing that's affordable  and what are we going to do to deal with this home foreclosure crisis  someone whom i admire so much is current governor of new jersey  jon corzine  who's with us  he is also a former united states senator with whom i served  and he was before that the chief executive officer of one of the largest  most successful financial firms in the world  goldman sachs  so he's had a lot of experience in both the public and the private sector  so governor corzine  two questions   specifically with respect to the housing crisis  how would you have approached a financial challenge like this when you were in the private sector  and what steps do you think we should take both at the state and the federal level  and then in addition  same question to you that i asked governor strickland  the three big challenges that you're coping with as governor  governor corzine   b governor jon corzine b  thank you senator clinton and it's great to be here in ohio and be with the great senator glenn  governor strickland and all the citizens  i have to say  senator clinton  the stories that i've heard already from the people here and the problems that's governor strickland outlined sound like i'm back home in new jersey  we have people that struggle every day to make ends meet on health care issues  on housing issues  they're worried about their jobs  we're actually just closing right now the last general motors auto production plant in our state  we had five auto production plants     years ago  we are going to have no auto production at all  so these are real issues  the housing crisis that we have in the country foreclosures  predatory lending  facts that people got into  home ownership under false pretenses by people who sold them more than they could actually carry are things that you were talking about when i was a united states senator  predatory lending was one of the things that we worked on together  this is not something that senator clinton didn't recognize before that's why i know she's the most qualified individual to be the president  and i'm an old washed up finance person but  i'll tell you  if you got in trouble in a corporate situation you'd go to your bank and you'd talk about having a moratorium on debt payments  you'd negotiate a new loan agreement  senator clinton has talked about that for the american people that are having trouble with their mortgages  we need a freeze on the rates of subprime adjustable lending that robert talked about  you can't  we're better to actually get robert to be able pay something than nothing   b robert landry b     b governor jon corzine b  it's ridiculous  its ridiculous and it needs to be dealt with  the second thing is we need to have a moratorium on foreclosures altogether so that people can catch up and make a difference  senator clinton proposed these things six months ago  not now  this is something she recognized before the housing prices became a huge problem  i think that speaks to the kind of president she'd be  not only about this issue  but a lot of issues  because she has the foresight to see how we ought to be addressing them  i have to tell you as a governor  she's also got another element of her plan where she wants to put   billion into funds that actually would get distributed to governor strickland or new jersey or states across  so that we can actually work with families more closely  we're all struggling with our budgets but if the federal government doesn't offer a partnership it won't happen  also i can tell you that both from my business background and from my life as new jersey's governor  i can tell you that the plans that she's laid down are practical  they show real solutions  they're far more than words  they are the real deal  this is how you get out of this crisis  senator clinton is onto the right track   b senator hillary clinton b  as governor corzine said  jobs are a problem everywhere  some places are harder hit than other places but the issue really is how do we keep the jobs we have and how do we create more jobs  i've been pleased the last several days to have a number of new yorkers travelling across ohio talking about the work we've done together to try to keep and grow jobs  i am grateful that i've been a partner with people like gary douglas who's the very active president of one of our chambers of commerce in new york who has been just focused on keeping jobs and bringing jobs to his part of the state  it's really important that we zero in on what works  how are we going to keep and grow jobs  i'd like to turn now to your lieutenant governor lee fisher  he is the director of the department of development here in ohio and lieutenant governor fisher is on the cutting edge of trying to bring advanced clean energy jobs to ohio  this is an issue that i am both passionate about and very excited so i would love to hear from lieutenant governor fisher about the steps you are taking to try to create clean energy jobs in ohio   b lieutenant governor lee fisher b  senator clinton  governor strickland has given me the double honor not just to serve as his lieutenant governor but also to serve as his director of economic development and so i wake up every single morning focused on one thing and one thing only and that is jobs and economic growth so that every ohioan  no matter where they live  no matter who they are  has the economic opportunity that many of us have had  i  like governor strickland  have had the opportunity to know you for many years  in my case   years  and i know the governor and i want more than anything else a partner in the white house who not only will come up with the solutions but understands the problems because she has actually dealt with them in her capacity not just as an elected official but as a private individual  cities like zanesville and cleveland and toledo are not new to you because you've been travelling to our cities for   years and i can tell you that i believe that our greatest strength in our state is the fact that we  under governor strickland's leadership  are marrying our proud past with an even more dynamic future  let me explain what i mean  ohio is known for many things but i would say more than anything it is known for three things  first  that we are the seed bed of invention  entrepreneurship  innovation  and exploration  the best example of exploration being none other than u s  senator john glenn  and i think you know that these days that we measure the strength of our economy not just by the height of our smoke stacks or the strength of our backs but also by the depth of our innovation and the strength of our ideas  which is why what we are doing is taking advantage of our strong manufacturing base  we are the third largest manufacturing state in our country  and why we are taking advantage of our agricultural base  as the largest economic force in our state  and actually converting that into the future  examples  we're going from bicycles  to bio fuels  we're going from gliders to turbine engines and lunar rockets  we're going from cellulose and cord and soy beans to ethanol and other biofuels  we're going from a manufacturing base to wind turbines  just this afternoon i spoke to a ceo of a company called minster machine where governor strickland recently visited  this is a company that began as a blacksmith's shop   years ago  they are known as a strong but small manufacturing company  the ceo  a year ago  after governor strickland was elected  and i think primarily because governor strickland was elected  decided to look into doing something new  they have started a division of minster machine called minster wind  and they are right now  with our help and with the help of other partners  creating a wind division and taking advantage of the fact that ohio has got this supply chain of manufacturers that can make the gearboxes and all the bearings and all the components of windmills  but they want to do more  they actually want to make the windmill itself  they don't just want to be the component parts  today we have over   manufacturing companies that are helping supply wind power around the world  and i believe that under governor strickland's leadership and the   billion jobs plan that he recently announced  we will end up setting aside  i believe  more funds in our state  senator  than any other state in the country  perhaps even more than new jersey and new york  for alternative advanced energy  we've already set aside   billion in low interest loans to private companies wanting to get into the wind business  and if the governor's plan passes this november  and i hope with all of your support we'll have not only a new president of the united states by the name of hillary clinton  but that we'll also have a new jobs plan that will set aside   but that we'll also have a jobs plan in november that will set aside   million above and beyond what we've already set aside for bringing ohio into the  st century and moving ohio to the head of the class   b senator hillary clinton b  that's exciting  very exciting  lee  you know  other countries have a head start on us  denmark gets a lot of its energy  now  from wind  as a result it's been manufacturing a lot of the windmills and obviously exporting them  germany is getting a great deal of economic benefit from investing in solar power and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs  and they've done exactly what you're describing  the government said  look  we've got to help start the market for this  we've got to have the low interest loans  we have to make the investments  we have to train the work force  that's why i've been a strong proponent of green collar jobs and passed the first training program to start getting people equipped to do this work  but i believe that we can create at least five million new jobs in america over the next ten years  and that's the kind of visionary work that you're doing  continuing our focus on jobs  which is the key here  i'd like to turn to gary dwyer who is the secretary treasurer for the ohio state building and construction trades council  gary dwyer is a   year member of the iron workers  he currently represents   union construction workers in ohio  gary  we would love to hear your views about the best ways to create good jobs here in the state   b secretary treasurer gary dwyer b  thank you very much senator  and when you say the title  i'm from the ohio state building trade  and that's what we like to do  build  we like to build buildings  bridges  everything  i want to tell you four brief stories if you let me about what happened to me in my personal career  when i joined the ironworkers local   in cleveland  ohio  at local we had   ironworkers in the steel mills every single day    today i don't even think sometimes you can even find   ironworkers in those mills  where did those jobs go  they're not up in cleveland anymore  i recently went up to cleveland  i've been away for over three years  and one of the biggest jobs that was going when i left was the job of dismantling the steel mill and sending that steel mill to china  it really saddens me when i go by that old vacant spot where the steel mill used to be and now it's a retail store  i think we have enough of these strip shopping malls in different places and we need to get back to our real manufacturing jobs  and our base  one of the highlights of my career as an ironworker was i was in charge of the children's christmas party every year and i did it for over   years  it was my job to go out and find union made toys for my   members' children  i would come out and worked very hard and my kids thought i was the greatest thing in the world when i would go and buy hundreds of different toys  after a couple years the list of union made toys started getting smaller  so finally i had to go to the second alternative and that was  made in america  and i did that for about three or four years and the catalogue that used to be that big started getting down and down and down  some of the names that you know like tonka  etch a sketch  all these things that i had bought for many  many years were no longer made in the united states  they were gone  once again  i told you  we like to build things  other effects when the jobs go out of town  we don't build new buildings and put those companies in  those manufacturing  my people  we just don't work anymore  one of the saddest stories i have  we built a building  a brand new state of the art building up in cleveland  senator  and i'm sure you've heard the name mr  coffee  no longer than we even built that building and the next thing  it was gone  they moved to mexico  after they were in mexico i think they moved to a couple other countries and then a couple other countries  the price kept going down  what they were willing to pay for that wage  but you know what  when you go in the store to buy that coffee maker  i've never seen the price go down  it's pretty sad  i'm not sure what happened to all those buildings that are sitting vacant  i used to live on the east side of cleveland and i can tell you all these horror stories  the stories that add addressograph  multi craft  fisher price  coit  all the different jobs are sitting up there vacant so when you build things and you have all these vacant buildings it's not a good thing  we have a lot of good hopes with you coming on  we look forward to building our manufacturing base  and i can tell you that things are changing around and it's changing in ohio because i had the opportunity   and this is quite unique here   i had the privilege and honor to go with lieutenant governor fisher to japan for a trade mission  when was the last time that a labor official got to go  myself and two other labor officials got an opportunity to go  and the thing that i came out with  when we were competing for jobs and the lieutenant governor was up there talking  everyone was saying  you've got to come here i'm from this business  i'm from this business  he always said the same thing  i'm here with the largest delegate of business and labor and we want your business here in ohio  i want to thank you very much for that  we're all in this together  and if we don't think like that  if we don't continue to have these discussions  we're all going to be going down the wayside by ourselves  we have started labor managements  we've been talking about them from day one now  how do we stay competitive and how do we start talking  senator  thank you for listening  i cannot tell you how excited i was to be invited to this panel and then can actually  and please do me a favor  when you're president  keep these conversations going   b senator hillary clinton b  yes  yes  great idea   b dwyer b  in closing i want to tell a couple of stories  i hate to say it  i was not only a builder but i was a marine  so i come from two very highly whatever you want to call it  but every year my ironworker international would have a training out in san diego  california and i was privileged enough to go out for training  just a little gut check  i would go out to a little place over there called marine corps recruit depot san diego and i would see what these young men and women protecting our country  and i would go there and i would just suck in the gut  get a little taller and i felt so good  then one day  probably about four years ago  i went there for my regular  to go buy my marine corps memorabilia and everything  i went into the store  i bought four shirts  i brought a couple back  i looked at the label  and  i'll tell you  it saddened me because that shirt was not only made in america at one time by a company called fruit of the loom  but now was being made in vietnam and was being sold in that marine corps recruit depot  and i have not ever worn another shirt with a marine corps emblem on ever since then  if we can not buy american  fix america first  there's something wrong  thank you very much for having me here   b senator hillary clinton b  thank you  thank you so much gary both for your leadership and your passion about what you do because you're absolutely right  we have to create a new ethic of patriotism  we've got to start being focused on making sure that our country  which has given so many blessings to many of us  continues to be able to do so for years and years and years to come  unfortunately we have a lot of ceos of major corporations today in america who seem to have forgotten how fortunate they are that they have been given the gift of american citizenship and support for them and their families  so we're going to call on them too to be part of the solution and to work  as you pointed out  hand in hand to try to get back those jobs and do it in a way that we can be very excited about what it's going to mean for our kids and grandkids going forward  so thank you so much  now we're going to turn to lieutenant governor david patterson from new york  david is a great friend of mine  he is an extraordinary public servant and leader  he has been working very hard on a lot of the same issues that affect ohio in upstate new york  i often say that upstate new york has a lot of similarity to ohio  our cities  our small towns  our countryside  our farmland  and i've been working very hard to create more jobs in upstate new york and david has as well  working with governor spitzer  david i'd like you to perhaps describe what you're doing and maybe some of he positive changes and successes that you're seeing   b lieutenant governor david patterson b  senator  i was thinking of exactly what you're saying when i was reading in the columbus dispatch this morning about a company that's going to pay workers   an hour and create   jobs in lancaster  ohio in fairfield county  and they are going to begin that immediately  and we find in new york this same issue as in ohio  ohio lost over one quarter of its manufacturing jobs  over   workers out of work since the year   new york has lost   manufacturing jobs going back to the same time period  what governor spitzer is doing is the same thing  getting companies to come into the state  going around  you get well the same way you got sick  a little at a time  trying to build back the workforce in upstate new york which is a region struggling for survival  its economy is such that almost   of our college graduates move out of new york to greater opportunities  but i think  senator  what you have talked about  can i call you madame president   b  senator hillary clinton b  no  not yet  david  not yet   b lieutenant governor david patterson b  i'm sorry  i'm just practicing  i just think that your ideas  just like what governor strickland is doing here in ohio with the research and technology corridor on route   in columbus  trying to take our educational institutions like ohio state and then use that to create new jobs  we do it in new york as well  we do it with medical and scientific research  the federal government has shut the door on medical and scientific research but also with green collar jobs  what you were talking about  that germany is the world leader in solar power  they have no more sunlight than the united states  the greatest amount of wind power jobs in this country were created last year  they actually created as many jobs in the succeeding four years  i think senator  president  whatever we can do to help you when you get to the white house is just the fact that the states are almost fighting among themselves and the jobs overseas  we need you to bring american jobs back to our shores and we need america to prosper in the way that can from the new technologies  what would be the new discoveries that can help us  in our state  in   we had   of the country's population and we did about   of the country's economic development  we built the erie lackawanna railroad and we built the erie canal  in those   years  new york state went to doing almost half of the economic development in the country and   of the people lived there  the people moved where the jobs were  now they are moving away and we are struggling more than other states  states like ohio and new jersey with governor corzine and all the other states have great ideas  we just need that extra help from washington and we will succeed   b senator hillary clinton b  thank you so much  david  i think the two examples david gave of the erie lackawanna railroad and the erie canal are really important because you heard governor strickland talk about the bond that he is going to bring to you as voters  when the governor of new york  back in the beginning of the  th century said that he wanted to build a canal from new york city to buffalo  people thought he was crazy  in fact  his name was clinton and they called it 'clinton's ditch' and 'clinton's folly' and all kinds of derogatory terms  but he was a visionary and he said we can't just keep doing what we are doing  it's not working  we have to make big investments to make big changes  that's what abraham lincoln did with the intercontinental railroad in the middle of the civil war  it's what he did when he said we're going to have land grant colleges  we didn't even know we were going to keep the union together but he was looking at the future  it is what franklin roosevelt did with his work program and what dwight eisenhower did with the interstate highway system and president kennedy with the space program  you could look and see how at critical moments in our history  our leaders made bets on the future and it's time for us to do that again and there are always naysayers and people who said   oh  we don't want to do that  ask yourself  what's the alternative  we can't keep doing what we are doing  we've got to get really focused on how we're going to have a competitive economy  creating new jobs  i know we can do that  i turn now to someone representing one of our oldest continually operating companies in america located in upstate new york  corning  inc  a company that started our making glass and now makes a wide variety of products  it has always exported but has continually had to reinvent itself  if it had just stayed in the glass business  it wouldn't be in business  so we have to do the same for our country  christine pambianchi is the vice president of human resources at corning  i've been working very closely with them over the last several years because they are the largest employer in a part of new york and obviously we want to make sure those jobs stay and grow more jobs  christine is here today to offer some insight into how one american company is adjusting in the face of new economic challenges  christine   b christine pambianchi b  thank you so much  senator clinton  i'm very happy to be here today to tell you about the great work that senator clinton has done in partnership with my company corning incorporated to create jobs in upstate new york and not just jobs  but green jobs  i think when you hear my story you will see that this is an example that supports the plans that she is laying out that could be done on a national scale were she to be elected president which obviously i am very hopeful for  we are a glass and ceramic research company  as senator clinton mentioned  we've been around for   years and we invent materials  one of the materials that we invented is a type of ceramic that can be made into a filter that will actually clean the emissions from diesel vehicles  in the united states today we have approximately   million heavy duty diesel trucks and school buses that are on the road and the government has passed requirements for cleaner emissions of those  however  if we don't retrofit the   million vehicles in the existing fleet  we will not have a clean fleet until the year   as senator clinton got to know our country and some of our technologies  she also became aware of and championed causes around clean air and in particular  school buses  our children ride around in school buses and are very exposed to these harmful carcinogens and senator clinton championed legislation in washington with the epa and put a program in place called the clean school bus usa program  this program set aside monies that school districts could apply for to retrofit their school buses  this directly supported us being able to create   jobs in our diesel manufacturing facility in upstate new york  we have   million invested in inventing this business and building a manufacturing plant to manufacture it  these are really good manufacturing jobs in upstate new york and that business has continued to grow  in addition to the initial program with the epa for school buses  senator clinton has supported retrofit programs for the heavy duty diesel manufacturers and two other bills in congress and that has led to the continued growth of the retrofit business and the continued vibrancy of our business to provide these environmentally friendly products  that's one  i think  very concrete example  another story i wanted to share with you today is we do invent things  another thing that we invented that you may not all know is that we actually invented optical fiber and optical fiber is actually glass  we invented that product and we sell that product around the world  we have a large manufacturing operation in wilmington  north carolina  with recent growth we've been able to re open our facility in concord  north carolina  but in the last few years we came under attack in the world market and in particular in china and local companies in china manufacturing fiber sought to have our product either barred from entry to the chinese market or levied with significant tariffs  upwards in the neighborhood of   that would've made it impossible for us to enter that market and sell our product there  we obviously were defending ourselves against those potential harmful acts and we called on senator clinton who came to our aid  she didn't just follow with words  she actually gave written correspondence with the chinese government  met with them in person on our behalf and we actually prevailed and the chinese government sided with us and found that our products should be allowed to enter those markets free from those very harmful tariffs  that again sustained our investment in our research center and our business that we have in optical fiber  we have a large research center in upstate new york  we have   employees that work in both technician  as well as phd scientist positions inventing products  if you look at the details of senator clinton's stimulus package  she calls for continuing to invest in research and innovation and then translate that into manufacturing jobs that we can keep in the united states  hopefully these stories are good examples of what she's done for her current constituency base and i think she would be able to do for us on a national scale  finally  there is a lot of job about health care  you'll hear from other people as well as the senator on that subject  but it's a topic that is very important to employers  as well  as we look to keep jobs in america and have america be competitive in the manufacturing environment  it's very challenging as an employer to figure out how to combat double digit growth in your health care costs every year and then try to keep your manufacturing costs balanced so you can be the leader in your markets on a global scale  i think that senator clinton understands these issues from a citizen and an employer and the perspective of what i think is best for the country and i think that she is best equip to work with us on that issue  finally  i would just like to offer that i am actually a life long new york resident  i was born in the bronx  educated in upstate new york and now i work in new york and i would just like to say that as a citizen of new york i am so proud of what senator clinton has done for us as our senator and would just offer personal testimonial of what i think she could do for the country  so thank you   b senator hillary clinton b  thank you christine  it's been really a great experience working with corning because they are committed to their community and they are committed to our country  i haven't had that experience with every company  i've had to have some pretty strong words with some ceos who were going to move jobs out of new york even though the plan where those jobs were being performed was profitable  and the people working in the plant  some union  some non union  they'd all gone the extra mile  they'd cut back on all of the ways they could to be more efficient  they changed work rules  everybody felt like they were on the team together and productivity went up and profit went up  the company said we could make more money elsewhere  that  to me  is just so unfair  what we've got to do as we level the playing field is eliminate every single tax break that people still get for exporting jobs  then we've got to start putting some tax breaks into supporting new jobs and give people the incentives to keep those jobs right here  as you heard from christine and from others  we keep coming back to health care costs and we do it for a reason  we cannot continue to pay what we pay for health care and remain a competitive economy with a strong and prosperous middle class  we just can't  the average american family pays   a year for a family policy  some pay out of their pocket  some it's shared with the employer  some get more of a share than others    a year  i feel very strongly about this issue  as you know  but i'd like to bring some additional perspectives to bear here  one of the people that came today you will recognize her company because she is the ceo of weight watchers  florine mark is in the business of helping people lead healthier lives  but she's also struggling to help companies provide health care to their employees  so florine  would you give us your perspective as a ceo and as a health advocate  what do you think are the most important things we should do to fix our health care system   b florine mark b  first of all let me say what an honor it is to be sitting here with you and everyone around this table and when i listen to the governors' talk about their states  michigan has been in a recession for a while  we're the home of gm and chrysler and ford and when i hear that there are no more gm plants in your state governor  it really pains all of us  and we are working very hard  we have a fabulous governor  governor jennifer granholm who is working so hard and trying to bring in jobs and trying to work with the big three and if i could just do a little commercial  please buy american  please buy american  health care  i want to take a different slant at it because i'm really coming from preventative medicine and what makes me so excited about senator clinton is that she really believes in preventative medicine and that's the key to it all  that's going to lower our health care costs  she has a plan which is so very  very  very important  do you know how many kids are failing school because they are fat  do you know how many kids are not getting to school because they are fat  do you know how many kids are dying  not just grownups but kids who are dying  i met a   year old the other day who was   lbs overweight with high blood pressure  high cholesterol  all of these terrible things and nobody seems to be doing anything about it because the kids are sitting in front of the computers  they are not really being motivated to get up  and the first ting that we cut out when we have to cut out our school systems is physical education  so education is extremely  extremely important  i want to tell you that i'm the mother of five  the stepmother of two   that makes me a mother of seven and the grandmother of   gorgeous grandchildren  several of them are in college  i have one that is a third year medical student and one that is just starting veterinary school and i am so privileged to be able to help these kids and help pay for their schooling  you have no idea how high it is  i think my medical student is   per year to go to medical school  just think of how many potential einstein's and clintons and jonas salk's and edison's that are out there that will never have an opportunity to go to school  to go to college  therefore your plan on education excites me  makes me feel safe because when i think of president  excuse me  senator clinton  i think of the word safe because i know she is kind  good  smart  tough   she is brilliant  she is nurturing  she has a sympathetic part about her  an empathetic part about her   who will do for the country what she is going to do for my children and my grandchildren  hopefully my great grandchildren and my great great grandchildren  so education  preventative medicine  getting people to understand how to eat  how to be healthier  that's very important  education is very important and i'll tell you one other thing  i will only feel safe if this woman becomes president of the united states of america  i feel that if god forbid  that phone  that red phone in the white house rings  i want her there to answer it   b senator hillary clinton b  we're going to put a moratorium on compliments  i'm very grateful for those very kind remarks  but i really feel that what you've done in emphasizing prevention is key  we can save money if we actually prevent disease  there is a lot of evidence  increasing evidence that if people in health insurance plans are encouraged to quit smoking  to get more exercise  to eat right  to take their vitamins  have their exams  to do what is necessary to make sure they are healthy  we will actually save money as well as lives  that's what florine tries to do every single day but we have to do it on a broader scale and we need everybody involved  business  labor  government  everybody has got to be focused on this  so that we will be part of the bully pulpit because i remember when i was in grade school and junior high  we used to have these president's physical fitness awards  i don't know if anybody remembers those  remember that  once a year we'd be taken to the gym and we'd have to run and jump and do all sorts of things  i was never very good at it  but i was there  and even though i wasn't very good at it i would get this certificate and it was signed by the president and i really thought president kennedy was sitting in the white house signing each and every one of our certificates  i thought that was just the greatest thing and i still have them in some scrapbook somewhere  we need to be doing that again and one of the real examples of physical fitness  of course  is john glenn  john glenn has been extraordinary all of his life   b senator john glenn b  you'll note that i sent here next to florine hoping that a little of this impact would rub off on me   b senator hillary clinton b  i'm just thrilled that we are talking about prevention because it is so important  i want to turn now to marilou martinez stevens  she is from texas  she is chairman of the new america alliance which is an organization of latino business leaders who are devoted to the economic advancement of the latino community and she does a lot of work developing small businesses and supporting small businesses  small business is really under pressure when it comes to health care  so marilou  can you tell us how health care issues are affected the small businesses that you work with in texas   b marilou martinez stevens b  first  thank you very much for bringing small business to the table because i think a lot of people are leaving small business out of the discussion  as you know  small businesses employ more people than larger corporations and yet we are not often at the table of discussion  small business are  as you also know  overburdened in a lot of areas and what we are looking for  what i was so excited to hear about  is that you are looking for ways to partner with small business on how to help them become less burdened and help them hire more people and grow  because as most of us know that the economy functions really on the back of small business  if small business is growing healthy  the economy of the united states is healthy and growing  one of the challenges  and i see a lot with small businesses as we are planning  health care is a huge  huge burden  small businesses want to help and to create health services for their employees  we do  the issue is  and the reason is  because most of us work with the same people over and over either related or over many years so they are like family to us  it is heartbreaking when we see that certain people like our employees cannot get that care  i'll tell you a terrible story about one of my clients that had a young lady that was having trouble at work and my client came and said this employee is wonderful  she's always been the backbone of my company  she's being kind of back  pulling back  and i knew her very well and i asked her and she had a very sick child and she was telling me that her medication was going to cost   two treatments a week so that she could breath  she had some kind of pulmonary problem and i said oh my goodness  how can it get that expensive  and she said   we missed one appointment  because it would've cost   but now i don't know what i am going to do  every time i think about it i get choked up because i'm a mom and i know most of you are parents and how do you deal with that  i mean  you can't concentrate on work  you can't do what you want to do because you've got this responsibility to your family and i've started now several years back working with small business to find different solutions on how to provide the needed health care for their area  now  there are a lot of things in the tax code that does allow for some type of reimbursement with small businesses but nothing covers catastrophic problems  for instance  a major accident   just driving  you run that risk  long term disease  something that you didn't know was coming and those kinds of things you can't afford to even help out  in my case  the employer was able to figure out  i can help you with that and she thought  i didn't know you could do that  but when you're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars  even the most caring employer can't help  we are so excited that you are looking for ways to partner up and look outside of the realm of how   especially the idea you talked about with colleges  graduates are coming out and they have large debts and how can we create incentives for them to start a type of business  most of you have heard of pre paid legal  i'm thinking we need to look at pre paid medical so that we can start with the less expensive  so if i have a cough  if my child has a cough i can do and i know that it's not going to be hundreds of dollars and i can get his medication and i don't have to wait until later on when it is pneumonia and you need more expensive equipment and more expensive medication that can't be afforded  so we're looking for ways to have real health care and not disease management  which is extremely expensive and small business can't afford it  so i am really  really excited that you are inviting us to the table and looking for solutions like that so that the small business can continue to be the backbone of the united states   b senator hillary clinton b  you are absolutely right  small business is the backbone and it has created the most jobs in america in the last twenty years and under my health care plan  small business would not be required to provide health care to employees but would be given benefits if they chose to help  the problem is if you are in a small business  insurance companies can really discriminate against you  i think it's unconstitutional for insurance companies to discriminate  i think they should not be permitted to do that  the best way to get the cost down is to get everybody in the system because if you are in a small business with ten  twenty people  it's impossible if somebody gets sick  there is no way you can continue to afford that group insurance  if you are in a system with millions of people then you are going to be able to afford it  so that's why we need for small business  also to be part of the universal health care system and we can make that happen with the right kind of tax credits and limits on payment and ending insurance company discrimination  which is one of the parts of my health care system because until we get control over insurance companies  we are not going to be able to get the costs down so they have to be part of the solution  whether they are enthusiastic about that or not  it's time that we had doctors and nurses and health care professionals and business and labor and leaders at all levels of government working together to make these changes that the insurance companies will have to go along with  that's what we're going to do if we have a chance to implement it  final topic is education and work force development  and zanesville mayor butch zwelling  the mayor of the y bridge city  i know you are working hard to improve the skills and the training of workers here in your city and that you have had some success in bringing some new business even though you have lost some  it's been something you've worked really hard on  could you talk about some of what you've learned about education workforce development   b mayor butch zwelling b  thank you so much and thank you for being in zanesville  ohio and bringing the outstanding people that you have brought  we appreciate and welcome all of you to zanesville  we have felt the brunt of much of everything we have talked about here today  incidentally  my friend florine here set me straight  i said was the senator saving the best for last  and she said   no  alphabetical order  anyway  we have lost some industry  as part of the housing crisis  we've lost all american homes    jobs in manufacturing  we have lost jobs from the lear corporation who relocated in mexico  we have lost some jobs at the longaberger company  but we are not whining around about  we are doing something about it  we have an outstanding port authority and the county commissioners and the city hall work together although we're not all the same politics  we are on the same page  though  we have an outstanding director of the port authority and we have brought in in the past year the bilco company from connecticut  the aamco company from belgium and avon is presently building a   million distribution center right here in zanesville  i know we have a moratorium on compliments and i have a million i could give to you but i want to tell these people in zanesville and our distinguished visitors that much of the credit for the businesses  the manufacturing that has come to zanesville  bilco  aamco and avon  was with the cooperation and help of governor ted strickland and lieutenant governor lee fisher  one of the things that i think that you are going to be very sensitive about is community development and block grant finding  we have been cut  cut  cut under the bush administration  we've lost   of that funding since   and i spoke before a congressional sub committee a couple of years ago when president bush was threatening to cut the whole program out as a way to balance his budget  president bush doesn't understand that this is the tip of appalachia  that there are people in this area that do not have water and sewers and he doesn't have a clue about that  i know that you do and we are so excited about your coming to the white house to do something about that because that involves infrastructure  waterlines  sewer lines  that involves jobs  we have to have that kind of money in order to operate as a community  we have a   million budget  half of it goes to health care and payroll  there is no fat in our budget whatsoever  we are constantly doing something about it  we appreciate the help that we have in columbus  we also have a great congressman  zack space who helps us and is by our side fighting every battle with us  we have a great friend in sherrod brown and george voinovich in the united states senate and we've just got friends in the right places except one  we look forward to having that friend  you  in the white house  thank you for coming today   b senator hillary clinton b  thank you  mayor  thank you  you will have a friend and a partner  that's something that i look forward to and i also appreciate your mentioning the community development block grants  the way that the federal government under president bush and the republican congress has cut a lot of the aid that came to communities has put extra burdens on your tax payers and that is something that we will definitely address because it's very hard for you to manage a lot of the needs you have if you are just relying upon your own resources  finally  laura meeks who is the president of jefferson community college  she is also the chair of the ohio appalachian center for higher education  some of you may not know that appalachia goes up into new york  so i have worked with the appalachian regional council  i've worked with my colleagues  the senators from the states that are considered in appalachia  there is a tier of counties in southern new york that have very similar problems to what we are talking about here in ohio  laura  you see people every single day in ohio who are eager to get jobs  who are entrepreneurial  they are inventive  they have great ideas  they are going to work really hard  so what's the best way to make sure that these hardworking ohioans have a chance  how do we best make them ready and train them so that we can have a real match between the jobs we can create and recruit and the workers right here in this area   b laura meeks b  thank you senator clinton  speaking on behalf of   community colleges in the nation  you are a friend of community colleges  we know that  as a matter of fact  you get it  you opened your comments by saying about higher education  we need to make sure it is accessible and affordable for all  the other day we had a snow day  it was one of those great things sometimes you get to have  i don't know if you have snow days in zanesville but we had one at jefferson in steubenville the other day  i was by myself working and i heard someone and i looked up and there was a young woman  a young girl and her grandfather was with her  i thought it was her father  he explained to me that this young woman lost her father about a month ago and he said   this is my granddaughter  here is her application  this girl came in the snow to make sure that we had this application and her grandfather said   i'm a retired steelworker  had a good living but my granddaughter needs to make sure she goes to college  i took her application and i found her a cd catalogue and gave her a catalogue because that's what she wanted and i promised her i would get it in the next day when everyone was there  when i looked at her  she touched that catalog and it really became real to her  i look back on my life when i was twelve years old my father lost his business  he had a feed store  grinding feed for cattle and it burned  he became a truck driver and my mom washed dishes in a nursing home for twenty years  they made a good living but they taught me something important  and it's a lesson that all of us in higher education in ohio understand  it's that you have to get an education to get a better job and everyday we know that  what makes it difficult for us is the high cost of tuition and in ohio we do have a high cost  i am so honored to say that we have a governor  governor strickland  who froze tuition for the state of ohio for two years and he did that at a great price  when we talk about keeping the cost of tuition low  we need to make sure that we keep that low  you're right on  you get it  the other thing i'd like to say is that  we have a lot of work ethic  we have people with strong work ethic  we have a will to work  we have a fiber of higher education that can train people to work  what we need are the jobs  and you know what  we have them  we have the opportunity where we live we have smoke stacks  steel industries  we also have energy companies  we have first energy and also cardinal  aep and they're cleaning  they're using resource to put in clears  those are some very good jobs  youngstown state university and jefferson community college have a partnership  we've has   classes with   graduates  graduates in power technology who will go out and make at least   starting wages  we have really good jobs in the energy industry in ohio  engineering jobs and we have some hope of getting as coal liquefaction company that might come near us  i just want to say keep doing it  keep appreciating your higher education system in the united states  thank you for understanding the power of a community college  we have the will and we want to go to bed every night waking up in the morning knowing that someone in the white house shares our vision and our dream  that everyday in higher education we're trying to make the lives of people better for families in america by giving them a better chance for a better job  thank you   b senator hillary clinton b  oh great  that's so great  i just have to emphasize what you said about community colleges  they are so important for our economy  i was at columbus state community college a few days ago talking about the programs they have in order to train people for these new clean energy jobs and we can do this  we absolutely can do this  and i know  gary  you've been working in some of the apprenticeship programs  helmets to hard hats  a program that i've supported  so this needs to be joint effort  business  labor  government  education  all of us have to be on the same team  the american team  if we start once again playing on the american team  nobody can beat us  that's what i believe  i really appreciate everyone coming out today  because we want this to be an ongoing conversation  there are lots of good ideas that people have and we've been working to come up with what will make a difference  what might work in ohio might not work in texas  and so we've got to have a variety of approaches  the federal government needs to be a partner  of course  that means we've got to listen and we've got to be available  it's what i believe we do best if we actually roll up our sleeves and get to work together  i've put out this  solutions for america  economic blueprint  you can pick up copies on the way out  it's an abbreviated version  but it puts out some of the ideas that i believe could make a difference  at the end of the day we have to decide what kinds of future we want  it doesn't happen by accident  what laura was saying  you just don't stay at home and say i think i'll dream my way to a higher education  you've got to put on your boots  you've got to walk through the snow  you've got to deliver the application  you've got to attend the classes  you've got to be qualified  that's true in life  and it's true in a country  so it's our chance now to seize the  st century  i am absolutely convinced that our best days can be ahead for america  that all of the concerns we have  we can handle them  but we're going to have to be serious about how we do it  there's no doubt in my mind as i travel across ohio that people in ohio are ready  you have governor  a lieutenant governor  who i know are making a difference  we just need to stay with you  we can't get discouraged  we can't get into fads  try this and don't do it  building the erie canal took  david  how many years  about eight  twelve years  change does take consistent  concerted effort  but the real question for us is not whether change will happen  change is going to happen whether we want it or not  change is a part of life  it's whether progress will happen  whether we'll see the kind of progress here in ohio and texas and america that the people of our country deserve  so i'm very confident and optimistic about what we're going to do together  and i'm very grateful that we would have this opportunity with so many distinguished ohioans and visitors from around our country to talk about what we're going to do to make ohio as important and prosperous and successful to america's future as it was  governor  to america's past  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", " i below are excerpts of hillary clinton's prepared remarks for this afternoon's  solutions for america  rally in fort worth  texas   i   my opponent and i are in an important debate about national security   and which one of us is best prepared to take charge as commander in chief  he calls that fear mongering  well  i don't think texans scare that easy  we know we have a job to do   to end the war in iraq and win the war in afghanistan  when my opponent says it's fear mongering to talk about who is ready to protect america  i say  if you can't have that debate with me  how can you have it with john mccain  we are running for the most important job in the world  and you can't run away from a debate on national security         my opponent talks about a speech he gave on iraq in   well  there's a big difference between giving a speech at an anti war rally and giving orders as commander in chief  when a crisis comes and that phone rings at   a m  in the white house  you don't have time for speeches  you don't have time for on the job training  he talks about these issues  but then he goes missing in action  he gave his speech about iraq when he was running for the senate  but two years later he said he agreed with the way george bush was conducting the war  he's running an ad that touts his position on afghanistan  he chairs a subcommittee on nato  which is a major ally in the war in afghanistan  but he failed to hold a single substantive hearing on afghanistan or anything else  he even went missing on an important vote on iran "], ["clinton", "thank you ohio  for everyone here in ohio and across america who's ever been counted out but refused to be knocked out  and for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up  and for everyone who works hard and never gives up  this one is for you  you know what they say  as ohio goes  so goes the nation  well  this nation's coming back  and so is this campaign  the people of ohio have said it loudly and clearly  we're going on  we're going strong  and we're going all the way  you know  they call ohio a bellwether state  it's a battleground state  it's a state that knows how to pick a president  and no candidate in recent history  democrat or republican  has won the white house without winning the ohio primary   audience  yes  she will  yes  she will  yes  she will  you all know that if we want a democratic president  we need a democratic nominee who can win the battleground states just like ohio  and that is what we've done  we've won florida  nevada  new mexico  arizona  michigan  new hampshire  arkansas  california  new york  new jersey  massachusetts  oklahoma  and tennessee  and today  we won rhode island  and thanks to all my friends and supporters there  this is a great night  but we all know that these are challenging times  we have two wars abroad  we have a recession looming here at home  voters faced a critical question   who is tested and ready to be commander in chief on day one  and who knows how to turn our economy around  because we sure do need it  ohio has written a new chapter in the history of this campaign  and we're just getting started  more and more people have joined this campaign and millions of americans haven't spoken yet  in states like pennsylvania and so many others people are watching this historic campaign  and they want their turn to help make history  they want their voices to count  and they should  they should be heard  so please  join us in this campaign  go to www hillaryclinton com  this is your campaign and your moment and i need your support  for more than a year  i've been listening to the voices of people across our country  the single mom who told me she works two jobs  neither provides health care for her kids  she just can't work any harder  the little girl who asked how i helped people without homes   turns out her family was about to lose their own  the young man in a marine corps shirt who said he waited months for medical care  he said to me   take care of my buddies  a lot of them are still over there  and then  will you please help take care of me  americans don't need more promises  they've heard plenty of speeches  they deserve solutions and they deserve them now  america needs a president who's ready to lead  ready to stand up for what's right even when it's hard  and after seven long years of george w  bush  we sure are ready for a president who will be a fighter  a doer and a champion for the american people again  oh  i think we're ready for health care  not for just some people or most people  but for every american  i think we're ready for an economy that works for everyone  not just those at the top  but every single hard working american who deserves a shot at the american dream  i think we're ready to declare energy independence and create millions of green collar jobs  we're ready to reach out to our allies and confront our shared challenges  we're ready to end the war in iraq and win the war in afghanistan  and we're past ready to serve our veterans with the same devotion that they served us  protecting america is the first and most urgent duty of the president  when there's a crisis and that phone rings at   a m  in the white house  there's no time for speeches or on the job training  you have to be ready to make a decision  i congratulate senator mccain on winning his party's nomination and i look forward to a spirited and substantive debate with him   audience  yes  she will  yes  she will  yes  she will  i want to thank the wonderful people of ohio for your support and your confidence in me  i especially want to thank governor

join  join with the ohioans who voices and votes have been heard today  together  we will seize this moment  lift this nation  and heal and lead this world  thank you all and god bless you "], ["clinton", " i below are excerpts of hillary clinton's prepared remarks for this afternoon's  solutions for america  rally in harrisburg  pa i  after seven years of an energy policy written by and for the oil companies   with help from dick cheney   oil has now reached   a barrel   and gas prices in some areas are approaching   a gallon  i understand senator obama is talking about energy today  right here in pennsylvania  and that's great  but talking about problems is easy  solving problems is hard  and speeches are no substitute for solutions  speeches won't lower gas prices  stop climate change  or lessen our dependence on oil from saudi arabia  the true test comes when it's time to match rhetoric with results  and unfortunately  we've seen that senator obama's promises and speeches are often just words  on the campaign trail  senator obama talks about clean energy  but in the senate  he voted for dick cheney's energy bill loaded with new tax breaks for oil companies  when he faced a tough choice  his support for a clean energy future turned out to be just words  it's like how he talks about fixing nafta  but his top economic adviser assured the canadian government that he wouldn't really follow through  his position  just words  senator obama promises to withdraw from iraq within   months  but his top foreign policy adviser said he's not really going to rely on that plan  i guess that plan is just words  too  we need a president who will solve problems  who will fight for our families long after the speeches are over and the cameras are gone  that's the choice in this campaign  solutions you can rely on   versus words you can't "], ["clinton", "good morning  i want to thank secretary west for his years of service  not only as secretary of the army  but also to the veteran's administration  to our men and women in uniform  to our country  i certainly do remember that trip to bosnia  and as togo said  there was a saying around the white house that if a place was too small  too poor  or too dangerous  the president couldn't go  so send the first lady  that's where we went  i remember landing under sniper fire  there was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport  but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base  but it was a moment of great pride for me to visit our troops  not only in our main base as tuzla  but also at two outposts where they were serving in so many capacities to deactivate and remove landmines  to hunt and seek out those who had not complied with the dayton accords and put down their arms  and to build relationships with the people that might lead to a peace for them and their children  so it's a great honor being introduced by secretary west  i also want to thank rear admiral david stone who commanded the fleet off of kosovo and was an instrumental part of our successful efforts there  and brigadier general pat foote and major general george buskirk who are representing the more than   generals and admirals who have endorsed me and who provide great assistance and counsel to me and to my staff  i want to thank president steven knapp for once again being the host  i'm getting credit for coming to gw  i come so often  and i'm thrilled to have that added to my academic career  and i want to thank the faculty  the staff  and the students at this great university  i started my morning meeting with the taoiseach  bertie ahern  to talk about the peace process in northern ireland  and it was a stark reminder of how long the road is toward peace  but how necessary it must be that we travel it  and we travel it with like minded friends and allies and those willing to take risks for peace around the world  it has been five years this week since our president took us to war in iraq  in that time  our brave men and women in uniform have done everything we ask of them and more  they were asked to remove saddam hussein from power and bring him to justice and they did  they were asked to give the iraqi people the opportunity for free and fair elections and they did  they were asked to give the iraqi government the space and time for political reconciliation  and they did  so for every american soldier who has made the ultimate sacrifice for this mission  we should imagine carved in stone  they gave their life for the greatest gift one can give to a fellow human being  the gift of freedom  and to our veterans and all those serving in iraq today  i want to send a strong and clear message   your extraordinary devotion to our country and to your service makes us proud and profoundly grateful every single day  the mistakes in iraq are not the responsibility of our men and women in uniform but of their commander in chief  from the decision to rush to war without allowing the weapons inspectors to finish their work or waiting for diplomacy to run its course  to the failure to send enough troops and provide proper equipment for them  to the denial of the existence of a rising insurgency and the failure to adjust the military strategy  to the continued support for a government unwilling to make the necessary political compromises  the command decisions were rooted in politics and ideology  heedless of sound strategy and common sense  fortunately  ten months from now we will have a new president  and a new opportunity to change course in iraq  therefore  the critical question is how can we end this war responsibly and restore america's leadership in the world  it won't be easy  there is no magic wand to wave  bringing our troops home safely will take a president who is ready to be commander in chief on day one  a president who knows our military and has earned their respect  bringing lasting stability to the region will take a president with the strength and determination  the knowledge and confidence to bring our troops home  to rebuild our military readiness  to care for our veterans  and to redouble our efforts against al qaeda  if you give me the chance  i will be that president  i will start by facing the conditions on the ground in iraq as they are  not as we hope or wish them to be  president bush points to the reduction in violence in iraq last year and claims the surge is working  now  i applaud any decrease in violence  that is always good news  but the point of the surge was to give the iraqis the time and space for political reconciliation  yet today  the iraqi government has failed to provide basic services for its citizens  they have yet to pass legislation ensuring the equitable distribution of oil revenues  yet even to pass a law setting the date of provincial elections  corruption and dysfunction is rampant  and last week general petraeus himself conceded that no one  in either the u s  government or the iraqi government  feels that there has been sufficient progress by any means in the area of national reconciliation  so by the middle of this summer when the additional surge forces have been sent home  we'll be right back at square one with   or more troops on the ground in iraq  that president bush seems to want to keep as many troops there after the surge as before and says that doing otherwise would endanger our progress is a clear admission that the surge has not accomplished its goals  meanwhile  as we continue to police iraq's civil war  the threats to our national security  our economy  and our standing in the world continue to mount  the lives of our brave men and women are at stake  nearly   of them have  by now  made that ultimate sacrifice  tens of thousands more have suffered wounds both visible and invisible to their bodies  their minds  and their hearts  their families have sacrificed  too  in empty places at the dinner table  in the struggle to raise children alone  in the wrenching reversal of parents burying children  the strength of our military is at stake  only one of our army brigades is certified by the army to be ready  our armed forces are stretched to near the breaking point with many of our troops on their second  third  or fourth tours of duty  our economic security is at stake  taking into consideration the long term costs of replacing equipment and providing medical care for troops and survivors' benefits for their families  the war in iraq could ultimately cost well over   trillion  that is enough to provide health care for all   million uninsured americans and quality pre kindergarten for every american child  solve the housing crisis once and for all  make college affordable for every american student  and provide tax relief to tens of millions of middle class families  our ability to win the war in afghanistan is at stake  when i first visited afghanistan in   i was greeted by a soldier who said   welcome to the forgotten front line in the war on terror  since then  the taliban and al qaeda have continued to gain new footholds throughout the country  and as a result  the overall terrorist threat  as our own intelligence community has noted  is growing  finally  our leadership in the world and our ability to front global challenges  present and future  is at stake  from extremism in pakistan  to nuclear ambitions in iran and north korea  to troubling antidemocratic trends in russia and latin america  to the threat of global epidemics and global warming and to the rise of china  the more the world regards us with suspicion rather than admiration  the more difficult it is to confront these challenges  despite the evidence  president bush is determined to continue his failed policy in iraq until he leaves office  and senator mccain will gladly accept the torch and stay the course  keeping troops in iraq for up to   years if necessary  they both want to keep us tied to another country's civil war  a war we cannot win  that in a nutshell is the bush mccain iraq policy  don't learn from your mistakes  repeat them  well  here is the inescapable reality  we can have hundreds of thousands of troops on the ground for   years  but that will not change the fact that there is no military solution to the situation in iraq  and don't just take it from me  at his confirmation hearing  admiral mullen  chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  said that without national political reconciliation  no amount of troops in no amount of time will make much of a difference  we simply cannot give the iraqi government an endless blank check  each passing month we stay in iraq gives the iraqi government more time to avoid the hard decisions on how to split the oil money and how to share political power  senator mccain and president bush claim withdrawal is defeat  well  let's be clear  withdrawal is not defeat  defeat is keeping troops in iraq for   years  we simply cannot give the iraqi government an endless blank check  each passing month we stay in iraq gives the iraqi government more time to avoid the hard decisions on how to split the oil money and how to share political power  senator mccain and president bush claim withdrawal is defeat  well  let's be clear  withdrawal is not defeat  defeat is keeping troops in iraq for   years  defeat is straining our alliances and losing our standing in the world  defeat is draining our resources and diverting attention from our key interests  now  withdrawal is not risk free  but the risks of staying in iraq are certain  and a well planned withdrawal is the one and only path to a political solution  the only way to spur the iraqis to take responsibility for their own future and to ensure that we don't bear that responsibility indefinitely  the only way to spur other countries to do their part to help secure stability in the region  the commitment to staying in iraq has driven president bush's foreign policy  it looks like it would drive senator mccain's foreign policy as well  but it will not drive mine  my foreign policy will be driven by what is in america's national security interests  so it is time to end this war as quickly and responsibly as possible  that has been my mission in the senate  and it will be my mission starting on day one as president of the united states  for the past five years  i have served on the senate armed services committee  i have been to iraq and afghanistan three times  i have met with our soldiers and military leaders  i have met with iraqi  local  regional  and national elected and other influential officials  here at home i've attended countless meetings and committee hearings where i have challenged high ranking pentagon officials and military leaders investigating the situation in iraq  probing the facts presented  and demanding real answers to tough questions  and i am honored that more than   of america's most esteemed former admirals and generals  including two former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff and five retired officers of the four star rank have endorsed my candidacy  the american people don't have to guess whether i'm ready to lead or whether i understand the realities on the ground in iraq or whether i'd be too dependent on advisers to help me determine the right way forward  i've been working day in and day out in the senate to provide leadership to end this war  that's why i cosponsored legislation with senator robert byrd to reauthorize the war  legislation that would actually end the president's authority to fight it  that's why i've started laying the ground work for a swift and responsible withdrawal beginning in early   by demanding that the pentagon start planning for it now  i've introduced legislation ensuring that congress would be briefed on those plans and that's also why i'm working to block president bush's effort to keep this war going after he leaves office  i've introduced legislation banning him from unilaterally negotiating a long term security commitment to iraq  including the possibility of permanent bases  i believe what matters in this campaign is not just the promises we've made to end the war  what matters is what we've actually done when it came time to match words with action  because more than anything else  what we've done is an indication of what we'll do  now  my democratic opponent talks a great deal about a speech he gave in   and i commend him for making that speech  speaking out for what you believe is a solemn  patriotic duty  he is asking us to judge him by his words  and words can be powerful  but only if the speaker translates them into action and solutions  senator obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail  but he didn't start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president  so when he had a chance to act on his speech  he chose silence instead  and out campaigning senator obama tells voters that as president he'd withdraw combat brigades from iraq within   months  but one of his top foreign policy advisers told a different story  she told a british television reporter  and i quote   he will  of course  not rely on some plan that he's crafted as a presidential candidate or as a u s  senator  senator obama has said often that words matter  i strongly agree  but giving speeches alone won't end the war and making campaign promises you might not keep certainly won't end it  in the end the true test is not the speeches a president delivers  it's whether the president delivers on the speeches  i have concrete  detailed plans to end this war  and i have not waivered in my commitment to follow through on them  one choice in this election is senator mccain  he's willing to keep this war going for   years  you can count on him to do that  another choice is senator obama who has promised to bring combat troops out in   months  but according to his foreign policy adviser  you can't count on him to do that  in uncertain times  we cannot afford uncertain leadership  here's what you can count on me to do  provide the leadership to end this war quickly and responsibly  today i'd like to talk about how i will do that  how as president  i will bring our troops home  work to bring stability in the region  and replace military force with a new diplomatic initiative to engage countries around the world in helping to secure iraq's future  the most important part of my plan is the first step  to bring our troops home and send the strongest possible message to the iraqis that they must take responsibly for their own future  no more talk of permanent occupation  no more policing a civil war  no more doing for the iraqis what they need to be doing for themselves  as president  one of my first official actions will be to convene the joint chiefs of staff  my secretary of defense and my national security council and direct them to draw up a clear  viable plan to start bringing our troops home within the first   days of my taking office  a plan based on my consultation with the military to remove one to two brigades a month  a plan that reduces the risks of attack as they depart  as we bring our troops home  i will ensure we are fully prepared to take care of them and their families once they have returned  i will direct the department of defense and the department of veteran's affairs to prepare a comprehensive plan to provide the highest quality of health care  disability benefits  and social services for every single service member including every member of the national guard and reserve as well as their families  and i will make sure this plan is promptly implemented  in the senate i'm proud to have reached across the aisle to provide access to tricare for all members of the national guard and reserve  even when they're not deployed  and to have passed my heroes at home act to help family members care for those who traumatic brain injury  the signature injury of this war because i believe when brave men and women sign up to serve our country  we sign up to serve them too  that is why i will also immediately adopt representative john murtha's urgent proposal to reduce the strain on our troops by reducing the permissible length of overseas deployments  going forward  we will ensure that our troops spend as much time at tome as they have spent deployed  so every month they spend in the field  they will be guaranteed one month here at home  i will also implement a proposal that i  representative murtha  and others have been calling for  requiring that before any brigade is deployed  the secretary of defense must certify to congress that it is fully combat ready  sending brigades that do not meet this standard puts our soldiers in danger and our mission in iraq or elsewhere at risk  in addition to removing american troops from iraq  i will also work to remove armed private military contractors who are conducting combat oriented and security functions in iraq  for five yeas their behavior and lack of supervision and accountability have often eroded our credibility  endangered u s  and iraqi lives and undermined our mission  now  senator obama and i have a substantive disagreement here  he won't rule out continuing to use armed private military contractors in iraq to do jobs that historically have been done by the u s  military or government personnel  when i am president i will ask the joint chiefs for their help in reducing reliance on armed private military contractors  with the goal of ultimately implementing a ban on such contractors  i've already cosponsored the stop security outsourcing act requiring that security services for personnel at any u s  diplomatic or consular mission be provided only by federal government personnel  it's also a time we put an end  once and for all  to the no bid contracts that squander taxpayer money while lining the pockets of the president's cronies  between   and   spending on no bid contracts more than doubled  representing half of all federal procurement spending  today companies like halliburton are enjoying record profits thanks to a   increase in taxpayer funds awarded to them  but a recent congressional report identified   contracts valued at   trillion where federal auditors found massive overcharges  wasteful spending and poor oversight  i'm proposing legislation to ensure that all new spending in   is done through competitive contracting processes  the heads of each agency would have to certify to congress under a sworn affidavit that their contracting awards processes are open and competitive  as president  i will work to pass this legislation into law and to end the era of no bid contracts and handouts to halliburton  it's an interesting comparison  we've had a lot of talk in this town and elsewhere about earmarks  and i am one of those who believe we need more transparency and disclosure in the earmark process  but no bid contracts are ten times more costly than earmarks  and when i introduce my legislation to eliminate no bid contracts  i could not get  at least as of this moment  senator mccain's support for that  as we bring our troops and contractors home  we cannot lose sight of our strategic interests in this region  the reality is that this war has made the terrorists stronger  well  they may not have been in iraq before the war  they are there now  and we cannot allow iraq to become a breeding ground and safe haven for terrorists who seek to attack us and our friends and allies  so let me be clear   under my plan  withdrawing from iraq will not mean retreating from fighting terrorism in iraq  that's why i will order small  elite strike forces to engage in targeted operations against al qaeda in iraq  this will protect iraqi citizens  our allies  and our families right here at home  the second part of my plan involves working to secure stability within iraq as we bring our troops home  stability that will be key to a successful withdrawal of our troops  i believe it's really quite simple  greater political and economic stability means safer conditions for our departing troops and a smoother disengagement from our military's actions across iraq  right now no one doubts that the iraqi government is failing its citizens  government officials refuse to take the steps need to order to advance a solution  improve the economy  quell sectarian violence and better the lives of ordinary iraqis  these failings are  in part  the fault of the iraqis and in part due to the bush administration's failure to match military efforts with political ones  for example  the u s  has created an armed local security forces  such as the awakening in anbar and the  concerned local citizens  but they fail to hold the iraqi government to its agreement to integrate these local militias and volunteers into provincial police forces or the national army  violence has fallen in the short run  but in the long run sectarian divisions among iraqis may only deepen  when i'm president  we will pursue a more integrated strategy  we'll empower local leaders and use u s  and international influence to press the iraqis to reach political reconciliation  and i will call on the united nations to strengthen its role in promoting this reconciliation  not having been a party to the mistakes of the path five years  the u n  which has already provided valuable technical assistance in iraq  is far more likely to be viewed as a neutral  honest broker than the united states  especially when it acts on behalf of a broad coalition of concerned states and the international community  the new united nations secretary general  ban ki moon  has indicated he is willing to play a key role in assisting the iraqis  i will also work with china and russia to ensure that the u n  envoy in iraq has the necessary authority by obtaining the security council's explicit endorsement of a strengthened u n  mandate to promote reconciliation  i will also call upon the u n  to help oversee the resettlement of the millions of refugees who have fled iraq or have been displaced internally  many are living in desperate conditions creating not just a humanitarian crisis but one affecting regional stability that poses direct threats to our security here at home which we must address immediately  while we focus our efforts on improving conditions so iraqis don't have to flee in the first place  we have to recognize our moral obligation to help those we have put at risk in iraq  the interpreters  soldiers who have assisted our troops  we will work with governments in both the middle east and the west  including of course the united states  to find places for asylum seekers  and we will work with the u n  to develop a plan to help them return  if possible  to iraq once the country has stabilized  i would further seek to stabilize iraq by insisting that the country's oil revenues  instead of u s  taxpayer dollars  increasingly be used to fund iraq's reconstruction  when president bush began this war  his administration claimed that iraqi oil revenues would pay for iraq's reconstruction  well  the iraqi government has now earned tens of billions of dollars from oil  some estimates indicate that revenues this year will top   billion  yet since the beginning of the war  the u s  has allocated roughly the same amount of money as iraq for reconstruction    billion from us versus   billion from them  and now it is even clearer that the iraqi government is not spending its oil money on reconstruction  there are reports that iraq spent less than a quarter of oil funds set aside for reconstruction in   and the u s  comptroller general testified that as of november   the capital expenditure rate for the central ministries in iraq was only   oil profits are showing up in foreign banks even as iraqi citizens lack basic services  as president i would immediately direct the inspector general for iraq to appoint a special council to investigate and make recommendations directly to me for how to ensure iraqi oil revenues and u s  taxpayer dollars on a declining trend are used to rebuild iraq  it is unacceptable that these oil revenues go unused or worse end up in private accounts while citizens lack electricity and clean drinking water  we will support iraq's efforts to rebuild their country  but we will not permit our money or theirs to be thrown away  i will work to crack down on the black market for oil in iraq  according to recent news reports  insurgent groups a profiteering from a substantial black market in oil  the money they make is going in part to pay for ieds  car bombs  and other tools of terror  the iraqi government simply has not done its part to crack down on this corruption  the equation here is simple  if we cut off or disrupt these illegal sources of funding  we can deny the insurgents the money they need to maintain their campaigns of violence  so i will order a joint nationwide u s iraqi crackdown on black marketers and oil smugglers  we'll beef up protection for oil lines to prevent illegal tapping and attacks  we will cut off illegal networks  identify where the stolen oil and other goods are going  who is stealing them  and capture those responsible  we will work with our international community to try to cut off access to the funds that hold these oil revenues  and we will maintain the crackdown success by sending a strong signal to the iraqi government  show results in rooting out corruption or lose your aid  the third and final part of my plan to end the war involves replacing our military force in iraq with an intensive diplomatic initiative in the region  over the past four years  we've learned the hard way about the need for a truly multilateral approach in iraq  one built on sound strategy and long range planning  not ideology and wishful thinking  the president's go it alone strategy has diminished our position in the region and around the world  and that diminished position  in turn  has made it increasingly difficult for us to bring about a political solution  our friends and allies in the region have an especially large stake in building a stable iraq  but until now in part because of the bush administration's mismanagement of the war  they have lacked leadership and gotten a free pass  that must end  ten months from now we will have a new opportunity to reach out and engage our allies  one of my very first international meetings as president would be with our treaty allies and our friends in the region including the gulf states  jordan  egypt  and our european allies  over the course of my career i have known and worked with many of these leaders already  and i will send them a very clear message   what happens in iraq affects all of our interests  and it is all of our responsibility  it's time we did our part and paid our fair share  i will then convene a regional stabilization group composed of these key allies  other global parties  the states bordering iraq  the mission of this group will be to develop and implement a strategy to create a stable iraq  i would include in this regional stabilization group iran and syria  we must convince all countries in the region and beyond to refrain from getting involved in the iraqi civil war  to hold themselves and others to their past pledges to provide funding in iraq  and to support the central role for the united nations  these will be critical first steps toward establishing a new american approach in the world  one that draws on the strength of our alliances and the power of our diplomacy  and uses the greatest military force on earth as a last  not a first  resort  achieving all of this will not be easy  but we don't have any choice  when i look at the road ahead  i think about the men and women in uniform whom i've had the profound honor of meeting and serving  our troops serving not only in iraq and afghanistan  but across the globe  our veterans recovering in v a  hospitals and rehabilitation centers here at home  many with serious and life altering injuries  the countless veterans who are not given the support and services they need to reenter civilian life  these men and women have made extraordinary sacrifices serving the country they love  and i'm always struck by how no matter the extent and severity of their suffering  no matter how grave their own injuries  they always say the same thing to me   promise that you'll take care of my buddies  they're still over there  promise you'll keep them safe  i have looked these men and women in the eye  and i have made that promise  and i intend to honor it by ending this war as responsibly and quickly as possible  thank you all very  very much "], ["clinton", "thank you very  very much  wow  i am thrilled to be here  it is great being here at afscme council   i want to thank president al garrett for inviting us to his house and have this opportunity to be with you  i want to also thank javier for his wonderful comments  i love seeing the way so many young people are intensely involved in this campaign and we want to keep it that way  including the young people right here in michigan  i want to recognize just a few other people that i am pleased to be here with  jim blanchard  former governor of michigan  along with his wife janet  jewel ware  who has done a wonderful job as the chair of the wayne county commission  i know her husband is here  and i am grateful jewel's support  david hecker  president of the michigan aft  ron duncan of rwdsu  i know that debbie stabenow your fabulous senator was here earlier and her husband tom athans is here  i am thrilled to be with you in michigan once again  because michigan is a bellwether state  it is a diverse state  it's a proud union state  and is a critical state for democrats to win in november  i am here for one simple reason   to make sure michigan votes are counted and your voices are heard in this election  i know that governor granholm couldn't here because she was long scheduled to be in western michigan  where she is working to help create jobs and grow the economy  but i want to applaud her for her energy  her creativity  her tenacity and dedication in tackling the problems that michigan faces  let's give governor granholm a big round of applause  i know michigan  probably more than any other state  deserves a president who understands the challenges of a struggling economy  unfair trade policies  the loss of manufacturing jobs  the deterioration of health care coverage  and all of the other challenges from rising gas process to rising college costs  you deserve a president who will be your partner and that is what i intend to be if given the chance to serve  this has been an incredible primary season so far  there's been more passion and enthusiasm than anyone could have ever predicted  democrats across the country are turning out in record numbers to have their say in this historic election  here in michigan    people turned out on a cold and snowy day in january to cast your votes and you made it abundantly clear that you wanted your voices to be heard and your votes to be counted  in florida    million people did exactly the same  now  these nearly   million americans are in danger of being shut out of our democratic process  i think that is wrong and  frankly  it is un american  and we cannot let that continue  my very first job in politics was working for the democratic national committee  going door to door  registering voters in texas in   i threw myself in to that hard work because i believed then  as i believe now  that every american has a right to be part of our great democracy  every voice should have the chance to be heard and every vote counted  this goes way beyond this election and it goes way beyond who's running  because no matter where you were born  or how much money you were born into  no matter where you worship or the color of your skin  it is a bedrock american principle that we are all equal in the voting booth  for me  it has been a long struggle to get to the point where barriers were knocked down and doors opened and we still haven't completed that journey  but it is the vote that has given voice to the voiceless and power to the powerless  it is through that vote that women  african american  latinos and so many others have claimed their rights as full and equal citizens  we have made our laws more just and our society more fair  each vote is a declaration of our dreams for our children and a reflection of our prayers for our nation's future  that is why generations of brave men and women marched and protested  risked and gave their lives for this right  it is because of them that both senator obama and i stand before you as candidates for the democratic nomination  it is because of all those who came before that we are both in this race today  we should carry on that legacy by saying clearly that we will protect and cherish the right to vote for all people  i've always stood up for voting rights  i'm proud of the legislation i've sponsored in the senate to assure that every eligible voter can count and every vote is counted and i will always defend your right to vote  no matter whom you choose to vote for in the end  it is not about that at all  because i believe that michigan's families are just as important as the families of any other state  the father in detroit wants the same opportunities for his children as the father in des moines  and he deserves the same voice in the future  the mother in lansing needs access to health care just as much as the mother in los angeles  and she deserves the same voice and how we will provide quality  affordable health care to everyone  the families in the u p  need good paying jobs that stay right here in america just as much as the families in central pa  and they deserve the same voice in trying to get that done  the soldiers from across this great state need a commander in chief who will end the war in iraq and bring them home  they certainly deserve the same voice in choosing that person  that's why i've been saying for some time that the people of michigan and florida must have a voice in selecting our nominee for president  i have called repeatedly for an agreement that would seat michigan delegates at our national convention  because i believe your voices and your votes should count  when others made the decision to remove their names from the ballot  i didn't  because i believe your voices and your votes should count  that's why i've been saying we need to either count the votes that have already been cast in michigan and florida or have new  full  and fair elections so that we can have your voices and your votes counted  senator obama speaks passionately on the campaign trail about empowering the american people  today  i'm urging him to match those words with action  to make sure the people of michigan and florida have a voice and a vote in this election  i have accepted the plan for a new vote in michigan  proposed in draft legislation and approved by the democratic national committee  in fact  the dnc put out a statement earlier this morning making clear that the proposal fits within the dnc rules  it is fully within the party's rules  i call on senator obama to do the same  this is a crucial test  does he mean what he says or not  i am pleased and grateful that on this issue  the people of michigan have had such outstanding advocates in their democratic leaders  and there are so many  including the governor and senator stabenow and members of the legislature  but i especially want to thank four who have really been at the forefront  senator carl levin  congresswoman carolyn cheeks kilpatrick  debbie dingell and ron gettelfinger of the uaw  people in michigan and particularly democrats in michigan know that michigan matters  both in the primary and in the general election  the road to a democratic white house goes through michigan and florida  if democrats send the message that we don't care about your vote  i'm sure john mccain and the republicans would be happy to have them  in fact  the republicans will argue that michigan and florida voters shouldn't trust the democrats to look out for them when we won't even listen to you  ignoring michigan and florida would be a grave mistake  we won't be able to end the war in iraq  we won't achieve universal health care  we won't end the housing crisis and get the economy moving again unless we win in michigan and florida in november  for me  it's really very simple  we need your voices and you have a right to your vote  i am proud to stand with the people of michigan in this cause and i hope that senator obama will join me  because when we look at the stakes of this election  they could not be higher  the next president of the united states will inherit a huge mess from george w  bush and we're going to have to do a lot of cleaning up  i can just imagine what it will be like to try to undo the damage that we will inherit plus taking on the neglected agenda that the votes sand families of michigan and american are waiting to have addressed  i've been criss crossing our country  saying very clearly that i offer solutions   st century solutions about how we're going to get the economy moving again and creating good jobs with particular emphasis on a state like michigan that deserves even more attention from the next president because you've been neglected and you've been ignored and your needs have been denied  it was amazing to me that the big three auto companies in the uaw had to beg for years just to have a meeting with the president  i met with them more than the president met with them  and what we were waiting for was just a smidgen of presidential leadership   we didn't ask for a lot  a little would have been welcome  some idea that  you know what  the auto industry and our big three manufacturers and the hard working members of the uaw deserve some help as we make this transition into a higher gas mileage economy  as we look for ways to support innovation from hybrid cars to more flexible fuel  that's all they were looking for  a partner who would be with them in this fight to save american jobs  to make sure that we retained leadership globally as we navigated through a much more challenging economy  but it didn't happen  so we're going to really have to go into high gear starting in january   because we're going to have to make up for all the lost time and the lost opportunities  we have big challenges   how are we going to create new jobs  how are we going to get the tax codes to quit rewarding businesses for exporting jobs out of michigan to foreign countries  how are we going to make that tax code fair and quit yielding a lower tax rate to some wall street money manager who makes   million dollars  then what is paid by nurse  a teacher or a truck driver making   right here in detroit or elsewhere across michigan  and what are we going to do to finally tackle our energy dependence  we can't live with   a barrel  oil and gas moving up to   a gallon  the average american is going to just be bewildered and distressed trying to figure out how to cover all the expenses because the price of everything is going up  but wages are not going up  people are not being rewarded for working harder  doing more  and more  and more  how many of you know someone with two  and even three  jobs that don't pay what used to be paid in the job they used to have before it was exported or done away with  and we cannot continue the moral outrage and the economic calamity of having a health care system that doesn't cover everyone and continues to cost more and more and more every single year  we've got to move for universal health care and we've got to do it quickly because we can't be globally competitive and expect to have our individual businesses bear all these costs  and we're sure going to have to deal with our education system  with more opportunities for children in the pre school years so that they're better prepared to go to school  with universal pre kindergarten and more head start and early childhood development  and i will end the unfunded mandate known as no child left behind  which hasn't worked and is not working  and we will make college affordable again for young people from middle class and working families  there's so much to be done here at home and  of course  around the world we have to restore america's leadership and our moral authority and that means we've got to begin ending the war in iraq  and i have been outlining this week  as we mark the fifth anniversary of george bush's preemptive war that he waged  i have been outlining plans as to what we can and must do to begin bringing our sons and daughters home  i am convinced that we can start within   days and do it in a responsible and careful manner  recognizing that the iraqi government has to take responsibility for its own future  that we have given them the precious gift of freedom and it is up to them to decide whether or not they will use it  but we cannot win their civil war  there is no military solution  and as we bring our troops home we must take care of them  our veterans deserve our greatest efforts to fulfill our obligations to them  get the healthcare and the other services that they have so richly earned and we've got to have a  st century gi bill of rights for these young men and women so they can go to school or start a business or buy a home  so there's a lot of work ahead but i am confident and optimistic that we can do this work together  and i know that the next president of the united states is going to have to have a united country with everyone once again believing that our best days are ahead  and working to achieve big goals again like universal healthcare and energy independence and so much more  well  i sure want michigan and florida to be right in the forefront of helping to make the choice as to who will walk into that oval office next january  thank you all very  very much "], ["clinton", " i the following are excerpts from a press availability that hillary clinton held at the university of pittsburgh at greensburg earlier this afternoon i   social security is a big issue in this campaign  there are differences between myself and senator obama and there are very big differences between myself and john mccain  and i have to admit to being somewhat surprised when i saw that senator mccain had said that he would try to continue to try to privatize social security along the lines of what president bush tried and failed in doing in   that is a very significant difference between the two of us     pennsylvania as you know has a higher percentage of older people than most states so it is a particular concern to a lot of pennsylvanians who are on social security  like a couple we heard from earlier today who keep seeing their expenses increase and realize that they are in a very difficult position trying to afford all of the necessities of life and being on a fixed income like they are  that's why it's so important that we are doing everything we can to meet the long term challenges of social security  the social security trustees just issued a report  actually while i was speaking  and there has been some improvement in the outlook for social security according to some  to the social security trustees  so i think that it reinforces what i have said for a long time  which is we have some long term challenges  it is not a crisis  we can fix what's needing to be changed in social security  our real challenge is medicare which is much more in crisis and deserves closer attention     i the following is clinton's response to sen  mccain's comments on the housing crisis   i   it sounds remarkably like herbert hoover and i don't think that's a good economic policy  we have a framework of regulation  it needs to be updated and modernized  the government has a number of tools at its disposal that are well suited for just this situation  i think that inaction has contributed to the problems we face today and i believe further inaction would exacerbate those problems  i've laid out what i would do  i don't think it's an adequate response to say the government shouldn't be helping either banks or people because i think that would be a downward spiral that would cause tremendous economic pain and loss in our country and i don't see why we should wait by for that to happen "], ["clinton", "thank you very much  is labor in the house  i am pleased to be in the house of labor  i want to thank my friend and your native son  president mcentee  for that introduction and for more than   he hates when i say this   for more than   years    years of leadership in afscme and the labor movement  when you have gerry mcentee by your side  there is no battle too tough  there is no challenge too great and i am very grateful for his support and the support of the great union he has  i want to salute bill george  his tough and passionate leadership of the pennsylvania afl cio is legendary  when bill asks what time is it  we all know the answer  it's union time  because under his watch  more and more people are joining unions and becoming part of the labor movement right here in pennsylvania  i am very cognizant of the fact that bill and his wonderful family have suffered such a loss in the last month  but i'm sure she's looking down and saying  you're looking good  bill  and we think you're looking good because you make such a difference to so many people  isn't it nice to have a president named george you can actually believe in  i also want to recognize rick bloomingdale and pat eiding  i know that you've already been great to have mayor michael nutter and congressman chris carney  we've got a couple of international presidents  michael goodwin and warren george  i know that senator casey was here earlier and i'm looking forward to inviting him to the white house to talk about what we will do on behalf of pennsylvania and the american labor movement  i started my morning at the william j  donovan company where i got to visit with sheet metal workers at a company that's been in business for   years  understands the importance of having trained workers  starting people off as apprentices moving towards becoming journeymen  once again  i was reminded that american workers are the hardest working  most productive workers in the world  as i watched these processes take place and ended up at a part of the factory where it hand work that has to be done because of the precession required  a lot of the work is going to pharmaceutical companies and hospitals that require the highest level of skill  i asked the gentleman working  how long has it taken you to get to the point where you can do this work that is so specific and where the slightest possible imperfection could cause a batch of drugs to be thrown out for example  he said   about   years  started as an apprentice  apprenticed for   years  and now doing work that has no equivalent anywhere in the world  these are jobs that can't be outsourced  these are jobs that go right to the heart of the skill and workmanship of american workers  i also think it says something that it takes a lot of experience before you are really  really good to do the job  i flew into philadelphia yesterday  thanks to union members working in the air traffic control tower  i drove here today in a car built by union members from steel made by union members  over roads laid by union members  we passed by schools where children are taught by union members  by hospitals where people are cared for by union members  came to a hotel that is staffed by union members  in a building that was built by union members  now  i'm standing here with all the union members who are some of the hardest working  most compassionate  most patriotic americans i know  so when some people  and you hear them  act like unions have no place in america  i wonder what country they are living in  unions are america  and unions built america  and made america the greatest  richest  best country in the world  let's not forget  we know what happens to workers when we don't have unions  don't we  think about what life would be like here in pennsylvania before the labor movement  back in   another courageous union leader and great woman by the name of mother jones led a march of children from here in philadelphia to new york to demand an end to the scourge of child labor  in   a landmark study found more than   industrial fatalities in allegheny county in one year alone  and the great steel strike of   included brutal repression of workers in pittsburgh and protesting work weeks of up to   hours  imagine    hours a week in the dangerous conditions of those steel mills  the labor movement changed america for the better  dr  martin luther king  jr  summed up labor's significance before an afl cio gathering much like this one   the labor movement  he said   was the principal force that transformed misery and despair into hope and progress  when the wave of union organization crested over the nation  it carried to secure shores not only itself  but the whole society  these words remind us that when dr  king was taken from us   years ago this week  we lost a powerful voice for justice of all kinds  including economic justice  dr  king knew that unions helped make the american dream a reality for millions of americans  labor helped build the middle class  we need unions not just in good times  but in hard times too  especially in hard times  with our economy facing a recession  we need unions standing strong because your negotiations help raise the standard of living for every american worker  when health insurance is out of reach for   million americans    million right here in pennsylvania alone  we need unions standing up for the right  not the privilege  the right to quality affordable health care  when other countries exploit their own workers to get them an unfair advantage  we need unions standing up for workers rights here and around the world  no one knows better than our unions what it means to fight for the underdog  every day  you are standing up for workers who need someone to stand up with them  and i'm in this race for the very same reason   to fight for everyone who needs a champion in their corner  for me  this campaign is not about me   this campaign is about all of us  this campaign is meant to repudiate the political philosophies and the governing of the last   years  because our current president and vice president have a very different view of america  they honestly believe that somehow it works best for america when we keep giving more to those who already have more than enough  and that we take away from those who are struggling just to get to the level of subsistence and possibility  that's why they gave big tax breaks to oil companies making record profits  while you pay through the roof at the pump  i met with a group of truck drivers in harrisburg yesterday  they are pretty fed up with high fuel prices and they were making their opinions known  who is listening  i'm listening  but it doesn't seem like the white house is listening  the president is too busy holding hands with the saudis to care about american truck drivers who can't afford to fill up their tank any longer  i meet workers all over pennsylvania and elsewhere who lost their pensions  they have seen companies go into bankruptcy and discharge their obligations  we have a vice president  who  when he was ceo of halliburton which now gets all these no bid contracts  don't they  from the government  workers lost   billion in pensions  but dick cheney got to strap on a golden parachute worth   million  you get tax breaks to people who don't need them while our children get stuck with the bill  now  i never thought i'd say this but ever since my husband got out of full time public service  he's actually made money  much to both of our amazement  but i have to confess  as recipients of all of george bush's tax breaks  i can tell you i didn't need them  i didn't want them  i didn't ask for them  and when i am president  we're going to take those back from people making over   a year in america  and has there ever been in recent history a more anti union  anti labor president and white house  they are not just looking for the union label  they are looking to squash the union bug  they want to eliminate unions and union workers   it's ideological  it's personal  after seven disastrous years of george bush and dick cheney  the stakes in this election couldn't be higher  and the need to change course couldn't be more urgent  but i am here to tell you  senator john mccain  a friend of mine  someone whose service to our country i admire  is only offering more of the same  john mccain admits he doesn't understand the economy   and unfortunately he's proving that day after day on the campaign trail  he looked at the housing crisis  and he blamed consumers  his plan for the economy is to extend george bush's tax cuts for billionaires and give a   billion additional corporate tax cut  the bush mccain philosophy could not be clearer   it's the  ownership society  which really means  you're on your own  if you're not a crony  if you're not wealthy  if you're not well connected  you fend for yourself  the others are taken care of it  but don't take just my word for it  even a republican senator mel martinez from florida after listening to senator mccain's economic pan gave it an  incomplete  and he said   where i think he fell short  is the fact that we need to do some things that can help families  that can help people  well  duh  yeah  we do  we need to do something that can help the american people for a change   put the middle class back into the driver's seat  give our families the opportunities they deserve  you know  sometimes when that phone rings at  am in the white house it's an economic crisis  it seems like john mccain would just let it ring and ring and ring  well that's not good enough for the families that i have met across pennsylvania  i was with a group of families in harrisburg yesterday at a diner  sitting around talking  what were they concerned about  the high price of gas  losing their homes to foreclosure  being able to afford to send or keep a child in college  wondering where that next job is going to come from  these are the stories and concerns that are on the minds of the people here in pennsylvania  i think we've had enough of a president who didn't know enough about economics  and didn't do enough for the american middle class  we're ready for a president who will meet the challenges of our time  now i know taking on senator mccain in november won't be easy  republicans aren't going to give up without a fight  and no matter how beautiful your rhetoric  the republicans are not going to turn off their attack machine   it doesn't have an off switch  but one thing you know about me is that when i say i'll fight for you  i'll fight for you  i know how to fight for you and that's exactly what i will do throughout this campaign  look  i know there will be hurdles and setbacks between now and november  but i also know that i'm ready  i know what it's like to stumble  i know what it means to get knocked down  but i've never stayed down  i never will  and neither will you and neither will america  we are on the comeback trail as a country  this is one of the most important elections we've ever had  there is so much at stake  you heard as president george talked about what a difference it made to go from a republican governor and republican senators and republican members of congress  but we've got to finish the job and it's so important that the people of pennsylvania have their voices heard and their votes counted  senator obama says he's getting tired of the campaign  his supporters say they want it to end  could you imagine if rocky balboa had gotten half way up those art museum stairs and said   well  i guess that's about far enough  that's not the way it works  let me tell you something  when it comes to finishing the fight  rocky and i have a lot in common  i never quit  i never give up  and i know that we are going to make it together   not just up those stairs  but we are going to climb that mountain to a better day for america  we have so much work to do and we won't get there if we quit or we walk away  we'll get there by staying and fighting and standing up for what we believe in  but i don't need to tell any of you this  no one knows better than organized labor how important it is to have a fighter on your side  when you send someone to the bargaining table  you need the strongest  toughest  most determined person you've got  not someone who is just going to talk about problems  but someone who will roll up her sleeves and get the job done for you  a president who gets up everyday and asks   what am i going to do for the american people today  what am i going to do to make sure you've got good jobs that can't be outsourced  what am i going to do to make sure we have trade agreements that are pro american and pro worker and make sure that we can compete with anybody  anywhere  anytime  if you give me the chance  that's the kind of president i will be  that's what i'll do because that's what i've always done  alongside labor  i fought for and passed an extension of unemployment insurance in the wake of september   i went to the floor of the senate everyday and stood up to the republicans and said we are going to extend and expand unemployment insurance until we finally got it done  alongside labor  i'm fighting on behalf of the brave and patriotic workers who came to ground zero after september   across the entire new york area  ironworkers  operating engineers  laborers  everybody dropped what they were doing and came rushing to see how they could help  so many of them got sick  they had to quit working  the man who could carry hundreds of pounds  run marathons could barely walk up stairs or breathe  alongside labor  i've fought for the collective bargaining rights of federal employees  the department of health and human services  the department of homeland security  the department of defense  tsa screeners  and public servants like our firefighters and police officers  alongside labor  i've supported the helmets to hardhats program  to help veterans get those good jobs that they deserve to have after their service  i'm working with my good friend  congressman murtha to expand this program and i am so proud to have jack murtha's endorsement  there isn't anyone i would rather have in a foxhole for a tough campaign and a tough election than jack murtha  and i've fought alongside labor in my home state of new york   home to one out of every seven union members in america  i've urged ceos to return to the bargaining table  encouraged employer neutrality in organizing campaigns  i've urged construction companies to hire local union workers  and i've joined workers on the picket line  i'll keep standing with you  fighting for you  and speaking out every single day as president of the united states  because i don't think the work ends with the election   the work begins with the election  we have to get into that white house  we're going to have to clean house once we get there  i'll start by ending this administration's practice of harassing and bureaucratizing our labor organizations  making it impossible for you to do the work that you are entitled to do  and how's this for a radical idea  we're actually going to appoint people to the department of labor  the nlrb  and throughout the government who are actually pro labor for a change  next  we're going to stop outsourcing our government to private companies that are too often less qualified   and less accountable and actually cost more  why on earth would we pay a private contractor more to do what a government employee was doing better for less  and let me just say this  i am deeply concerned about acceleration of the outsourcing of production for essential defense material  i was in indiana the last couple of days of last week   everywhere i went talking to good hardworking hoosiers  i heard about how company after company that used to do defense work had either lost the work or the company was gone  one specific example just stuck in my mind  all of you have seen those pictures of the precision guided missiles  right  going down chimneys  hitting targets thousands of miles away  well  the targeting is dependent upon these magnets and the magnets used to be made in indiana  the company called magnequest  the company was bought out  jobs were eliminated  production was moved to china  not only did we lose jobs  we lost essential  valuable information because you're not going to tell me that the chinese military doesn't have exactly what it takes to make those magnets  now we are going to outsource our refueling tankers  here's what i would do as president  i would strengthen our national defense that support both our men and women in uniform and american workers  and prevent the exporting of essential knowledge that keeps us safe and enables us to have the greatest military in the world  most important of all we'll protect the right to organize for a new generation  this is a basic right and you know it's under attack  that's why i'm proud to be an original co sponsor of the employee free choice act  i am proud to stand up for it  speak out for it and fight for it in the senate  we're going to take our case to the american people  and when i'm president  i would sign it into law  and you're all invited to the signing ceremony on the south lawn of the white house  so if anyone asks you if labor will have a seat at the table in my white house  i hope you know my answer   of course you will  labor built that table  there's going to be enough chairs around it for everybody to have a place  we're going to negotiate a new american bargain   for all of our people  let me tell you what it will include  first  i will fight for every single job in america  we can't save them all  but we're going to save a lot more of them than we have been lately  then we're going to create millions of new  high paying jobs that can't be outsourced  president bush has stood by and watched as we've lost   million manufacturing jobs since he became president  he's doing nothing about the loopholes in our tax code that actually encourage companies to ship jobs overseas  meanwhile  senator mccain believes business as usual on trade is just fine  he says that some lost jobs  are not coming back  that seems fine with him too  well i think it's time for a different approach  today  i am announcing an aggressive infrastructure agenda will create at least   million jobs over the next decade  after the failed levees in new orleans  the tragic bridge collapse in minnesota  we don't need any more devastating wake up calls  and you don't have to look any further than the problems you had with i  to know that we have to take action now  we're trying to run today's economy on yesterday's infrastructure   our bridges  our tunnels  our roads  our water systems and so much else   and we are jeopardizing american prosperity  so i will rebuild america by rebuilding  repairing and modernizing our infrastructure  and i want to salute the work of your great governor  another incredibly visionary effective leader  ed rendell on this issue  he has not only made great strides here in pennsylvania but he's leading the way nationally on infrastructure  i intend to work closely with him as president  my rebuild america plan will create a   billion emergency fund to identify and repair critical infrastructure problems  we'll modernize our transportation systems  we've got a lot of transportation and transit workers here and i'm proud to have your support  we're going to invest in public transit and inter city rail  we're going to connect america with a national broadband infrastructure  all of our communication workers  our electrical workers  we need to have super information highway the way we have an interstate highway system so every part of america gets connected up  part of the global economy  we'll create a national infrastructure bank and i will use bonding authority to make these long term investments  think about it  in world war ii we had war bonds  maybe it's time we ask americans if they want to play a part in rebuilding america  i think millions and millions of americans will make those contributions  then we're going to turn around and put them into projects that will strengthen our economy and create room for that economy to grow  we can put at least   million americans to work  we're also going to create at least   million additional jobs in green energy  jobs making public buildings more energy efficient  jobs weatherizing homes to make sure that people get more value for their dollar  to save on home heating and cooling bills  jobs that will re open shuttered factories to build the clean energy technologies  i was last night in bucks county at one of the keystone industrial port centers  i saw these big wind turbines being made  with as i understand it union workers from the steelworkers  and i saw the future  and it is a future that we can expand  how will i pay for that  take the tax subsidies away from the oil companies and put them to work in clean renewable energy  this is another critical difference between me and my democratic opponent  my opponent talks about clean energy on the campaign trail  but when he had a chance to do something about it in the senate   remember where i come from  my dad was from scranton  actions speak louder than words   when he had a chance to do something about it he actually voted for dick cheney's energy bill  i voted against it  once again  when it was time to turn talk into action  his promises were just words  we have to be smart and tough at the same time  it's not going to be easy to take on the oil companies and the oil producing countries  but i'm ready to do it and with your help starting on april  nd that is just what i will do  we'll going to make trade work for american families  now  i've been criticized by both president bush and senator obama for this  but i believe we need a time out on new trade deals  i've been saying that for some time now  we've got to have new trade policies before we have new trade deals  that includes no trade deal with columbia while violence against trade unionists continues in that country  i appreciate gerry talking about how i did speak out and oppose nafta  the president made a different decision but whether its president mcentee or david gergen or the people that were in those meetings in the white house  they know that i raised a big yellow caution flag  i said i'm not sure that this will work  and i have a plan to fix nafta  with the strongest possible labor and environmental standards in the core text of the agreement  and unlike my opponent  i will never come to pennsylvania and tell the people here one thing while my staff says something else to a foreign government  you won't find me saying anything like that  when i say i'll fix nafta  i mean it   and i will back it up with action  yes  we will finally get tough on china  right now  china's steel comes here and our jobs go there  i testified before the international trade commission to try to put the breaks on the dumping of steel in our market  they manipulate their currency  they give illegal subsidies  they abuse workers' rights  and what do we get in return  tainted fish  lead laced toys  and poisoned pet food and polluted pharmaceuticals  that is a bad deal for america  when i'm president  china will be a trade partner not a trade master  and we're going to get that done  finally  we're going to start investing in manufacturing again  pennsylvania has lost   manufacturing jobs in the past year  nearly one in four manufacturing jobs since george bush became president  manufacturing thrived in pennsylvania throughout the  th century  it can thrive again  i disagree with people who say we can't be a manufacturing company again because i believe you can't have a strong economy if you don't make things  i don't believe you can support all these other jobs that you represent workers in if you're not generating jobs from actually producing things  so  for me  it's not just a question of what's nice  it's critical and essential that we bring manufacturing back  we also need it for our defense sector  as i mentioned earlier  so  there's going to be a lot of work to be done and we're going to have a very progressive agenda for working families  i will provide health care for every body  not leaving any one out  because it is long past time that we had affordable health care for every single american  and the big difference between me and my democratic opponent  i'm sure tomorrow he'll tell you he has a plan for universal health care  but his plan would leave out   million people  more than   here in pennsylvania  you're going to leave out a member of the painter's union or a member of their family  are you going to leave out someone who is already sick  you're going to leave out somebody who is making minimum wage  he chose to leave health care on the bargaining table when putting together his campaign  i'm not just going to talk about universal health care  i'm going to get it done  and the reason i am is because i am passionately committed to making our country do what we have not done both morally and economically  i could tell you hundreds of stories and i bet all of you could  you are so fortunate to have health care because you a member of a union and people negotiate for it  but  i was in ohio  along the ohio river during that campaign   i really liked how that ohio primary turned out by the way   and what i heard was this typical tragic story   the kind of story i've heard for   years and even longer going back to arkansas  i was eating in a mobile with some folks in the area  the deputy sheriff  he said i sure hope we can get health care for everyone and he told me about a young woman from that town  she worked at the local pizza parlor  she didn't have anyone representing her  she got paid minimum wage  she didn't have anybody saying you know  minimum wage is a poverty wage  you can't make a living on minimum wage  she got pregnant and she was having trouble so she went to the nearest hospital  and i don't blame the hospital  but they said  look  we can't do anymore free care  you're from a neighboring town   there was no hospital in her county   you have to give us a   before we exam you  she didn't have   she went home  a little while later  she was still having trouble  she went back to the hospital and they told her the same thing  the third time she went to the hospital  she was in an ambulance  the doctors  the nurses in the emergency room tried to help her  but they couldn't save the baby and the baby died  and she was in such distress  they had to airlift her to the nearest big city in columbus   take her the medical center  in the intensive care unit for   days  doctors and nurses and the hospital personnel did everything they could to save her life  sitting there in that mobile home listening to that story was just upsetting me so much  i think it's morally wrong in our country  a young women and her baby died because she didn't have health insurance  i think it is so economically wrong  and for the lack of   to examine her and do what was necessary to save her and her baby  hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent  we can do so much better than that  i will not rest as your president until we finally have quality  affordable  health care for every single american  there's a lot of work to be done  and i'm prepared to do that work  i've apprenticed and i've learned how to do it  i have watched it being done for   years  i've been on both ends of pennsylvania avenue  and i know very well what it takes for the president and the congress to actually make the changes we need  i'm going to propose cutting middle class taxes by   billion and i think we can get it done  because that money is going to go towards helping you afford college  help you afford to take care of an elderly relative  help you to afford health care  i'm going to stand up again to president bush's ill advised policies  and i'm going to end the unfunded mandate known as no child left behind and we're going to start anew with the kind of partnership we need from a president  we're going to give americans a secure retirement and we're going to make sure social security is safe and solid  none of this would be easy  but nothing worth doing is easy  i was thinking about that looking at the sheet metal workers today  how many mistakes were made before that perfection was reached  how much work had to be done before you felt confident in trusting that new assignment or that young sheet metal worker  we could go through any kind of work any of you do and say the same thing  well  it's true about our government too  it's not going to be easy  but we can make it happen  again  as dr  king said   either we go up together  or we go down together  and gerry  he spoke those words   years ago this week  the sanitation workers on strike in memphis   members of afscme local     he urged them to move on  and that's what i urge us  there isn't anything we can't do as americans once we start acting like americans again   once we roll up our sleeves and we get to work  some of you have heard me say this before  and i'll say it again it took a clinton to clean up after the first bush  and it'll take a clinton to clean up after the second bush and with your help  that is exactly what we're going to do  thank you and god bless you  and god bless america "], ["clinton", "thank you all  i am deeply honored to be here today on this very important commemoration and for this significant gathering  i want to thank bishop blake for his leadership here at home and around the world  particularly in africa  his personal commitment to the people and children of africa has resounded so profoundly beyond his church and beyond our shores  it sets a good example and it issues a challenge for so many others  i thank you bishop  this is a very distinguished gathering here  i want to recognize my long time friend ambassador charles stith who did superb work in tanzania and has continued with his innovative and unique commitment at boston university to creating an archive for the papers and memory of african leaders  that will be part of our history  it will not be lost  it will be there for generations to come  one thinks about dr  king studying at that great university and those who would follow in his footsteps or in any other's will now have a much broader and richer historical scholarship record to learn from  i want to thank my friends and another great leader  reverend eugene rivers  for his commitment over many  many years to helping young people and providing alternatives in a way that keeps faith with our faith  but which puts aside the trappings of church and religion and goes into the streets  that has made such a difference to so many over such a long time  we are also honored to be with the chairman of the judiciary committee in the house of representatives  congressman john conyers  who has led with such prophetic commitment as well to what is right  and now is in a position to influence the future of our country  it will be a good day  mr  chairman  when you don't have to be investigating all of the abuses of power of a president any longer  and we'll be able to come together around a positive agenda  congressman steve cohen  i'm grateful for his leadership  my dear friend  congresswoman sheila jackson lee  who just came in  who is  i would say peripatetic  in that she has more miles logged than anyone i know  i talked to sheila from iraq  from africa  from texas  new york  washington  d c  because she is a woman on the move  i'm so pleased that she is here as well  mayor willie herenton  one of the great long time committed mayors of this city  and is helping to oversee its renaissance  memphis is on the way back  mayor and that has a lot to do with your spirit and your love of this city  mayor wharton of shelby county  your partner in such activities  one of the reasons i wanted to be here today was not only to honor the memory  the legacy and the challenges left to us by dr  king  but also to support memphis and to support what you are trying to do to really seize the future with confidence and optimism  bishop brooks  bishop macking  other distinguished clergy who are here  i am not sure if all of us are aware of the coming together in memphis today of so many from so many different groups to find common cause  now we must leave memphis united and committed to the changes that await our actions  ruth davis  the head of memphis sanitation workers  that is such an important person to recognize because in a very real way we would not be here if it were not for that strike and that demand in for human rights and justice that happened   years ago  secretary rodney slater  it is always an honor to be anywhere with my long time friend from arkansas  some weeks ago i was with reverend billy kyles at his church  as anyone who knows reverend kyles can attest  he has spent the last   years witnessing   witnessing to dr  king's life and death  because he was a witness  a witness who has taken the horror and tragedy of that day and channeled it into a mission to reach out wherever anyone who would listen to what was at stake  and still is  in our country and around the world  it is hard to believe that it has been   years  and it is also heart breaking to know that dr  king has been gone from this earth longer than he was here  when one thinks of his life   such a short life   going by in just a moment of time  but having such a profound and lasting impact on all of us  as a young woman  i was privileged to be taken to hear dr  king speak by a youth minister who opened my eyes and ears and my horizons  dr  king's call to action that evening in chicago led me to confront a world bigger and broader than the one i inhabited  he had a way of doing that  of pushing us outside our own comfort zone  of making it clear that we had to be part of the revolution that was going on  it wasn't a revolution of guns  it was a revolution of hearts and minds  of attitudes and actions  when one heard dr  king speak  and i stood in line for a very long time that night to shake his hand  and he was gracious  and he was kind to lean over to shake the hand of a  year old girl from the from the suburbs of chicago  who went to an all white church and an all white school  and lived in an all white suburb  but he didn't ask me  as i reached out my hand  where do you live  what is your experience  he just took it and looked in my face and thanked me for coming  that dr  king had such a profound and lasting impact on a young white girl  that he had that kind of impact on millions of people of all colors  faiths  ages and walks of life  tells us something about the reach and power of his vision  it was a vision big enough and bold enough and grace filled enough to embrace every last one of us  and when he came here to memphis to speak out on behalf of workers  he wasn't only speaking for those sanitation workers who were denied their rights  who had seen two of their fellow workers die in a cascade of garbage a few weeks before  he was speaking out for all workers everywhere who are exploited and abused and denied their basic rights  when dr  king protested the vietnam war  he wasn't just speaking on behalf of black soldiers  but all soldiers and civilians   vietnamese and americans alike  when he worked on behalf of the poor here in america and around the world  he wasn't just speaking for the poor he knew  that he could see with his own eyes  but the poor who knew no boundaries of geography or color  and when he stood against discrimination  he wasn't just seeking to free african americans from the shackles of slavery and the past that had been shaped by that abomination  he was seeking to break the shackles of hatred on the hearts of us all  he yearned for our country to fulfill the ideals that it had given lip service to  that were embodied in our founding documents  in his last speech here  he took us on a tour of history  but showed us the unfinished business and unrealized promises of america  dr  king understood our constitution better than most of us  he knew it was crafted to expand as our hearts expanded  it was not a constricted document from one place in time  but an expansive proclamation of what america could become if we had the courage to do so  slavery was written onto that document  but so was the potential for equality  he waged that revolution  but not just to change our laws  as i heard bishop blake talking about  but to change our hearts and behaviors  he reminded us that those who signed our founding documents were signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall heir  the promise of life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness  in the end he asked nothing more than that we redeem that promise  each in our own way through faith based institutions  through our businesses  our labor unions  through our political and public service  and even though as originally drafted we did not include dr  king or me either  women and african americans were left out of america's founding promises  but he never gave up and neither should we  his faith in america animated and sustained his journey  like with any faith  there were dark moments when one doubts  when one is on the brink of giving up and throwing in the towel  but he would always come back from those dark places and so must we  the tenacity of dr  king's faith is all the more extraordinary when we think of the ways it was tested  by all the critics and the media attacking his work  by the death threats  the bombings  the beatings  the stabbings  the murder  the grinding hard work day after day of just getting up and moving on  even the speech he gave here at this great complex wasn't supposed to be delivered  the crowd demanded it  and he came  he always answered the call  for those who are clergy  you know that it sometimes tests one's constitution and one's faith to constantly be asked to do more to reach out to keep going  someone of lesser heart and lesser faith might have grown weary doing good  might have given up  but he persisted in the struggle  and we know the results  so much has changed  i look at the young people standing in the back of this room  and it may be hard for you to imagine what you read in the history books  what your parents and your grandparents tell you  jim crowe is now something you read about  the people in this room lived under it  because of dr  king  these young people  my daughter's generation  grew up taking for granted that children of all colors could attend school together  because of him  after   years and   presidents who have been white men  this next generation will grow up taking for granted that a woman or an african american can be president of the united states of america  but as far as we've come  we know the journey is far from over  some days when you open up the newspaper and you read the headlines  it feels like we tumbled right back down that mountain top  doesn't it  some days it's amazing how deep the valley can be  at times like those i think of what dr  king said in his last speech  how he acknowledged we are living in a time of turmoil and upheaval  but then admonished us to remember only when it is dark enough can you see the stars  dr  king saw the darkness of a nation torn apart by petty human differences  but he imagined one knit back together by our shared humanity  he saw so many going hungry in a land of plenty  but he envisioned an america where our prosperity was shared  he saw america embroiled in an endless war  but imagined a principled peace  while our problems were grave  he never stopped believing that our promise was greater  he saw us not as we were  but as we could and should be  isn't it about time we started seeing ourselves as dr  king saw us  isn't it about time we came together as we have in memphis to find the solutions to make america what it can and should be  when i say solutions  i mean good jobs  jobs you can raise a family on  jobs that give people a shot at the middle class  to be able to stay there and live with dignity and respect  when i say solutions  i mean respecting the role of the american labor movement that has given that dignity and respect to so many  this time  once again  to give back the support we need to those who help workers organize and demand their rights  when i say solutions  i mean finally addressing the scourge of poverty that stalks so many  i believe  mayor  memphis has about a   poverty rate  down over the last years  but still far too high  i believe we should appoint a cabinet level position that will be solely and fully devoted to ending poverty as we know it in america  a position that will focus the attention of our nation on the issue and never let it go  a person who i could see being asked by the president every single day what have you done to end poverty in america  no more excuses  no more whining  but instead  a concerted effort  it's the kind of solution that dr  king's son martin has been passionately advocating for  when i say solutions  i mean schools worthy of our children that give each child a chance to live up to his or her god given potential  how about appointing supreme court justices who will actually uphold brown versus board of education and not reverse the progress that has been made  when i say solutions  i mean quality  affordable health care for every american  no exceptions  everyone entitled to health insurance  no more going into the emergency room  instead  going in the front door to the doctor's office to be taken care of  to get that preventive health care that will keep you healthy  i mean restoring america's moral leadership in the world  leading the fight against aids  malaria and tb  against poverty and genocide  we cannot let our brothers and sisters in africa and around the world continue to suffer needlessly  and i mean ending the war that has claimed too many of our precious sons and daughters  ending it as quickly and responsibly as humanly possible  and yet we must demand that our government pass laws that reflect our values  hate crimes laws  anti discrimination laws  equal pay laws and so much more  but that is not enough  the solutions we seek are not just about what government does or business does or labor unions or even faith based institutions do  it is what each and every one of us is called to do  there is still too much hatred dividing too many human hearts  every one of us has a chance  practically every day  to stand up to intolerance and injustice  like many of you here who are of a certain age  i will never forget where i was when i heard dr  king had been killed  i was a junior in college  and i remember hearing about it and just feeling such despair  i walked onto my dorm room  took my book bag and hurled it across the room  it felt like everything had been shattered  like we would never be able to put the pieces together again  i joined a protest march in boston  i wore a black armband  i worked to convince my college to recruit more students and faculty of color  but it felt like it wasn't enough  and then a few months later we heard of the assassination of robert kennedy  whose eloquence and courage had helped to persuade the people of indianapolis to follow dr  king's example of non violence  i remember wandering through the encampments of the poor people's march on washington talking with those who had come from literally around the world to witness against poverty and injustice  it felt like the doors had closed on the hope that so many had felt  but that would have been such a disservice to dr  king  to have taken the despair  the outrage and just ended with that  dr  king taught us everything we needed to know about his legacy and how to carry it forward  but in the end it is up to each of us to walk that path  it is not an easy path  it was hard for him  it is hard for us  sometimes we take steps backwards so maybe then we can figure out a new way forward  but i have abiding confidence  and yes  faith that we can make our way to higher ground  whether or not we make it to the mountain top  whether we make it to the promised land is not for us to know  but i believe with all my heart it is for us to try  and when we get tired and when our faith starts to waiver  we can of course remember dr  king's faith in us  how being dog tired that night  he left the lorraine motel and came here  i'm sure he would have liked a good night's sleep  i'm sure he thought reverend abernathy had done a fine job and there were so many good preachers there  but he felt called and he answered the call  as the scripture tells us  when we are called  we must answer  who will you send  send me  so here we are  let us remember and return to the well springs of faith from which he drew  one should re read dr  king's last speech  just as we ask children to memorize the  i have a dream  speech  one should re read that last speech  be reminded of the prophet amos who did shout and commend us to let justice run down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream  one can remember the sacrifice and suffering of jesus christ  who taught us to love our enemies  what an absurd teaching  at the time it was given  it was not even in the consciousness of humanity  love our enemies  turn the other cheek  what was he talking about  and yet  that has been a prophetic call that has echoed throughout the generations  one that dr  king took to heart  and let us remember the faith and courage of dr  king's brave widow  she returned to this city less than a week after his death to lead the march   the march for justice  she had not yet buried her husband and she was determined to carry on his work  with three of her children at her side  she did so with tens of thousands of people in solidarity with those striking workers  let us remember how dr  king's faith connects us through time and place and history  the notes of  we shall overcome  were sung in berlin as the wall came down  by chinese students marching in tiananmen square  in south africa at president mandela's inauguration  i even had that song sung to me by a group of women  poor  desperately poor women in india  who sang it in gujarati  their native tongue  from the prisoner of conscience in a birmingham jail  to a prisoner of conscience on robin island  from the students sitting at a segregated lunch counter in greensboro  to the students blocking the path of a tank in beijing  whether we are oppressed by tyranny  poverty  war or discrimination  that faith  that determination to keep fighting  working  building and believing has and always will carry us forward as long as we remember and as long as we remain committed to fulfilling dr  king's legacy and dream  thank you and god bless you "], ["clinton", "hello  montana democrats  let me ask you something  are you ready to take back the white house and take back this country  well  so am i  i am thrilled to be here tonight on the  richest hill on earth  i wanted to come out here for st  patrick's day  but i'm glad i decided to come tonight instead  because the only party in butte that is better than st  patrick's day is the democratic party  they say butte could be considered the birthplace of the democratic party in the rocky mountain west  and i am pleased to be where mike mansfield walked these streets and worked in the mines up the hills  i am also pleased to be here with your great governor  governor schweitzer  who has made such an impression far beyond the borders of montana  in new york  we love to quote schweitzer isms  there's a growing body of them  but it's great to be here and to be with my two colleagues  your great senators  senators max baucus and jon tester  having max and jon in the senate is such a great tribute to the people of montana  i want to thank you for sending them there  and i know that you'll keep sending max and you'll keep sending jon because we need them there every step of the way  i also want to thank congressman pat williams and state senate majority leader carol williams for their support and endorsement  to all the elected officials  the active and committed democrats in this audience  who says there aren't a lot of democrats in montana  there are people outside who couldn't get in tonight  this mansfield metcalf dinner is a great place for us to celebrate the resurgence in the west of the democratic party  i am so glad that this election will go on because by holding the last primary  the  last  best place  is going to help choose the next president of the united states  it will not be a moment too soon  as i have travelled across our great country  the overwhelming feeling that i see expressed by not just democrats  but even republicans  independents and people who don't frankly get very much involved in politics  is that we stand on the cusp of a new beginning for america  if you listen closely  you can almost hear it in the distance   the sound of the moving van pulling away from the back of the white house  we all wish that it would be tomorrow that president bush would return to that ranch and cut that brush instead of cutting back on children's health care and cutting back on veteran's health care and cutting back on the future for our children  but i believe the whole world will breathe a sigh of relief when george bush and dick cheney finally hand over those keys  but that's not when our work ends  that's when our work begins  i don't think we even know how much damage has been done to our country by the failed policies and the wrong headed priorities of this administration  for the past seven years  president bush has conducted a dangerous experiment in extremism  it has failed our country  he has had two priorities  tax cuts for the wealthiest and the war in iraq  and he hasn't paid for either one of them  he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus and he's leaving behind a mountain of debt  he's mortgaged our future with his reckless spending  while ignoring the problems that continue to pile up  so here we are  in april of   and we are borrowing money from the chinese to buy oil from the saudis  i don't believe it is right to stick our children and our grandchildren with the bill for president bush's failed presidency  it will be up to us as democrats to reassert the confidence and competence of our country's future  i am totally optimistic  i know how severe the problems are that we face  i understand completely how difficult it will be to turn our country around  but there isn't any problem america can't solve  there isn't any challenge we can't meet so long as we start acting like americans again  rolling up our sleeves and getting to work together  the contrasts could not be greater  instead of trying to solve our problems  president bush has used fear to divide us and fatalism to discourage us  he wants us to believe that we can't solve our problems  and that we shouldn't even try  moving toward energy independence  well that would wreck our economy  they tell us  moving toward universal health care  well that would wreck our health care system  since when did america become the can't do nation  as far as i know and the way i was raised  we know that you roll up your sleeves and you face the future realistically  yes  we do have to do what is necessary to take back the future  but i am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that america is ready  we are ready to be called to greatness again  we are ready to be asked to sacrifice on behalf of this country that we love  for seven years  the drug companies  the insurance companies  the oil companies and wall street have had a president  i think it's time the american people had a president again  we need a commander in chief who is ready on day one to end the war in iraq and keep our children safe  someone who knows how to manage this economy and strengthen the middle class  the american people need a fighter on their side  a president who will get up every single day and work her heart out for you  for your families  for your jobs and your futures  i am here tonight because i am ready to be that president  if there is one word that sums up my campaign and what it's all about  its solutions  i'm offering real solutions  not just speeches  i want to create a better future by making it clear that we have to not only set out a vision  we've got to know how to get there  you know that old story about how our political parties are like driving a car  don't you  if you want to go forward  you put it in d  if you want to go backwards  you put it in r  well  we're going forward in d  and here's why democrats need to drive that car forward again  tonight  across montana and across america  teachers are grading papers and nurses are caring for the sick  and they need a president who listens to them  tonight  janitors are cleaning up  and waitresses are pouring coffee  and police officers are standing guard  and they need a president who stands with them  tonight  families are sitting down around the dinner table  talking about how to keep the farm in the family or how to keep up with the bills that are mounting  and they need a president who will deliver for them  tonight  our brave men and women in uniform are serving across the globe  some on their second  their third or their fourth deployment  and they deserve a commander in chief who respects them  who cares for them and their families  and who brings them home and takes care of them once they do come back  americans deserve so much better  i am in this race to offer those solutions  because i believe america's best days are still ahead of us  for me  this is not just about the next election  this is about the next generation and what we must do to keep faith  to ensure that our children and our grandchildren have the same blessings and opportunities that we were given  to make the most of their own lives  to take the tools that are the product of a free market and the incredible entrepreneurial energy and innovation of america and put it to work  not only for a better future for themselves but for our country and our world  so when i say solutions  i mean an economy that works for everyone  not just those at the top  an economy where prosperity is shared again  and we create good jobs  jobs that will rebuild our infrastructure  jobs in clean  renewable energy  jobs in science and research  jobs that can support a family with a middle class standard of living that gives people hope in the future that they are building for themselves  when i say solutions  i mean reigning in those corporate special interests and rebuilding the middle class  i have proposed   billion in middle class tax cuts  tax cuts that will go for healthcare  to make college affordable  for secure retirement  part of the way we'll do that is to take away the   billion in tax cuts that have gone to those who  frankly  do not need your money more than you need your money  explain to me how it can make any sense that we have a tax code that still gives tax benefits to companies that move jobs and profits out of montana to foreign countries  we're going to end that  we're going to tell people the tax code of the united states will reflect the patriotic investment in jobs and businesses right here  in order to build a stronger economy  how is it fair that a wall street money manager making   million a year pays a lower percentage in taxes to our government than a nurse  a teacher  or a truck driver right here in montana pays to that government of ours  and when i say solutions  i mean a return to fiscal responsibility  i was raised by a father who didn't believe in credit  didn't have a credit card  didn't buy a house until he could pay for it  so i'm a little cheap  but i think that's what we need in a president again  who starts having the federal government live within our means  we're going to get back to pay as you go  and we're going to take a scalpel to that budget and look for anything we can take out so that we put our priorities back in  enough with the no bid contracts to halliburton and all of those crony companies of george bush's  there is absolutely no evidence that outsourcing our government saves money  but what it does is line the pockets of those companies and remove accountability  back in the  's  we saw rising incomes  the typical family saw   in income that came to them because the economy was moving up  more people were lifted out of poverty  it was a good time for america  occasionally  in this campaign  i hear somebody criticize the  's  that's fair  but i always wonder to myself  what is it they didn't like  the peace  or the prosperity  i could never figure that part out  when i say solutions  i mean making our federal government a partner with rural america  now i don't want to shock you tonight  but you may be surprised to learn that new york is home to   family farms  i know  where do they all go under the empire state building  but across our state and across so much of rural america  there is a feeling that the deck is stacked against family farms  i'm committed to working with your two great senators  to pass a strong farm bill that works for true family farms  with priorities like permanent disaster relief  strengthening country of origin labeling  renewable energy advances  rural development  broadband deployment  and i want to salute the leadership of senator baucus and senator tester  this farm bill needs to move and the president needs to get out of the way so that we can start taking care of rural america  it is great to have senator tester in the congress as a family farmer and an organic farmer  he has been a breath of fresh air  and of course we couldn't have a farm bill or nearly any other bill that actually had any money attached to it without senator baucus  so montana is right in the middle of these debates  when i say solutions  i mean declaring energy independence  i want america to sign a declaration of energy independence  i want our citizens to sign it because there's work for all of us to do to move toward energy independence  it's time we declared our independence from foreign oil  it's time we began looking for solutions from home grown energy  i want to be a president who is a good partner for governor schweitzer to help tap into the natural resources right here in montana   biofuels  clean coal  wind energy  the future has so much potential but we've been going backwards  we are actually more dependent on foreign oil today than we were on   explain how that makes any sense  i was waiting for president bush after   to say here's how we will respond  a goal that will move us away from our dependence on foreign oil  well  we've never heard a word like that and i know we're not going to move on clean coal or biofuels or wind or solar or the transmission and distribution system we need to transport what is created here elsewhere in the country  i know we won't do that until the two oil men leave the white house but as soon as they do  let's be ready  as president  i will invest in alternative energy with a   billion strategic energy fund paid for in two ways  by taking the tax subsidies away from the oil companies  it is hard to explain how a company like exxon mobil that makes   billion in profits last year needs your money to be successful  and certainly  when you look at what we need to do  that   billion strategic energy fund  we'll also ask the oil companies to be part of the solution instead of the problem  they can invest in renewable sources  they can clean up their facilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  or they can be subject to a windfall profits tax which we will take and put to work on developing alternative renewable energy here in montana  i figure we can create at least five million new good jobs and these are jobs that can't be outsourced  these are jobs that can be done right here in montana  because it is way passed time for us to stop holding hands with the saudis  and started holding them accountable  that's the kind of president that you can expect me to be  when i say solutions  i mean it is time to finally get tough on china  right now  china's products come here and our jobs go there  we play by the rules  they manipulate their currency  we get tainted fish  lead laced toys  contaminated pet food and polluted pharmaceuticals  i think that's a raw deal   and the united states government should say no more  no how  we're going to have new rules  they're going to play by the same rules and we're going to stand up for our consumers and our workers  when i say solutions  i mean finally providing universal health care  every single american will be covered  we have two big problems  we have the problem of   million uninsured   including more than   right here in montana   and then we have the problem of people who are insured except when it comes time to have the insurance company pay the bill  the insurance company won't pay the doctor or the hospital  so here's what i believe  if you have health insurance and you're happy with it  nothing changes  but if you are uninsured or underinsured  we're going to open up the congressional health plan  congress has a plan for itself and federal employees with more than   choices  it covers preventive care  mental health care  the kind of comprehensive health care that every american should have access to  for those who can't afford it  we're going to offer health care tax credits and i would like to see us limit the amount of money that anyone ever has to pay for their health care premium to a small percentage of your income  and we we're going to regulate the insurance companies so they not longer can discriminate against people  i think it is way past time  in our country it is unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race or religion or gender or ethnic origin and that is all for the good  but insurance companies can discriminate against you if you're sick or if you ever have been sick  it's time for us to tell the insurance companies no more discrimination  no more making life and death decisions  that should be left to doctors and nurses  not insurance company bureaucrats  and we're going to move toward universal health care coverage finally in america  when i say solutions  i mean public schools that are worthy of our children  starting with universal pre kindergarten going all the way through  i believe you've got to start with pre school  with head start  early head start  universal pre k so that all of our children get off to a good beginning  and i will end the unfunded mandate known as no child left behind  i believe in accountability and i have worked for that for more than   years  but i don't think you get that by turning our students into little test takers and our teachers into big test givers  we need a new partnership  a new partnership between the federal government  our schools  our students  our families and communities  i will offer that  i will also work to make sure that college is affordable for every single hard working student in america  when i say solutions  i mean keeping faith with our native americans  the first americans  it is time that we had a president who understood that we should fully fund the indian health service  that we should respect the government to government relationship  that we will have  once again  a partnership from the white house across america  every tribe  both in indian country and in urban areas  because i believe we must keep faith with our very first americans and i pledge  i will do whatever i can to make that happen  when i say solutions  i mean standing up always for social security  senator baucus led the fight against president bush's attempts to privatize social security  i was proud to fight alongside him every step of the way  when i am president  you are never going to have to worry about anybody privatizing your social security  of course  we have a lot of work to do around the world  we have to restore america's leadership and our moral authority  that begins by ending the war in iraq and bringing our troops home as quickly and responsibly as possible  it means reaching out to the rest of the world to find common ground to combat our challenges  we can't tackle global warming alone  as president i will lead the way to a new global agreement that will include india and china and the other fast developing countries  every part of the world must be committed to reversing global warming  when we think about taking on global warming or global terrorism or global epidemics  america  once again  must be respected  you cannot be a leader if no one is following and for too long under president bush countries have been on the sidelines or even actively opposed to us  i will immediately launch comprehensive global diplomatic efforts asking distinguished americans of both parties to travel across the world  to send a message that once again the united states wants to engage  wants to listen  wants to work with you  as we move from the war in iraq to once again standing on behalf of peace and security  we will be bringing our sons and daughters home  they will need a new  st century g i  bill of rights  with money to go to college  money for a home  money to start a business  it has been heartbreaking as a senator to see how many of our veterans have been left alone to fight a bureaucracy and cut through the red tape to get the health care they need  to get the compensation they deserve  i will be a commander in chief who recognizes that we have the greatest military in the world but force should be used as a last resort  not a first resort in the interest of our country and furtherance of our values  and it almost goes without saying but it must be said  that we will bring our constitution out of cold storage  we will restore the separation of powers  the checks and balances  we will end the abusive practices and power grabs of the bush cheney administration  this is the america we will build together   an america where the next generation is always better off than the last  but in order to begin to do this work  we have to win in november  that means we have to defeat senator mccain  a good man with a great record of serving america  he's a friend and colleague of mine and i admire his service  but he is offering the wrong ideas for our country  it is important that in the fall election we have a nominee ready to go toe to toe with john mccain on national security  he is willing to keep troops in iraq for up to   years  i'll start bringing them home within the first   days of my taking office  senator mccain has admitted he doesn't really understand the economy  and unfortunately  he is proving it in this campaign  he looks at the home mortgage crisis and who does he blame  not wall street  which helped create this mess in the first place  he blames the homeowners  he doesn't seem to understand that if our federal government can find   billion to bail out one firm on wall street  we ought to be able to find   billion to help homeowners stay in their homes and not lose them to the predatory practices of the mortgage industry  i think we've had enough of a president who didn't know enough about economics and didn't do enough for the american middle class  we're ready for a president who  no matter whether that   a m  call is about national security or an economic crisis  actually answers the phone and doesn't let it ring and ring and ring  trying to avoid taking responsibility for the mess that will be there when george bush leaves  taking back the white house won't be easy  you'd think that after george bush's presidency the republicans would apologize to america  it might go something like this   we are so sorry  we're not even going to run against you this time  i don't think that'll happen  in fact  i'm pretty sure that it'll be the same old republican attack machine  they'll be out there in full force  and we're going to have to be ready to take them on  i want you to know that i'm ready  i've been in there  in their attack mode for a long time  i know what it's like to stumble  i know what it means to get knocked down  but i've never stayed down  i never will  and neither will america  that's another reason why i feel right at home here because throughout butte's history  you never quit  when the silver market crashed at the end of the  's  you refused to give up  you kept digging  and you found copper  when the deep copper mines closed in the  's  you found new mining technology and you kept going  many times the national press and the pundits have said   butte's a goner  but you said   no  we aren't  and your progress today proves you were right  i'm awfully happy to be among people who have the spunk  the courage  and the determination to stay in the fight  to keep fighting for a better tomorrow  to know that we're going to bring that same spirit to this campaign  because one thing you know about me  when i tell you i'll stand with you  i'll stand with you  when i tell you i'll fight for you  i will fight for you  that's what i have done my whole life  and that's what we're going to do all the way to the white house next january  th    we're going to fight across all   states  we're going to campaign everywhere in america because we need to keep fighting because america is worth fighting for  everyday that goes by in this campaign  i become more determined and more convinced that we will be able to convince the american people to believe once again in our future  that we are a nation of optimists  a nation of idealists  we know what it takes to continue the progress that is the american birth right  so tonight  we say with one voice  give us the child that wants to learn  give us the people in need of work  give us the veterans who need our care  we say  give us this economy to rebuild and this war to end  give us this nation to lift  this world to lead  this moment to seize  the democrats are ready  i am ready  and i know montana democrats  you're ready  too  let's go forward to victory  thank you  god bless you and god bless america "], ["clinton", " i in advance of president bush's speech tomorrow  hillary clinton delivered the following remarks at a town hall event with senior retired military officers and pennsylvania veterans in aliquippa  pa earlier today i   yesterday in the senate armed services committee  i asked general petraeus for the conditions under which he would actually support a change of course in iraq  and to begin a drawdown of our troops  given that the surge has failed to achieve its stated goal of political reconciliation among the iraqis  well  he didn't really answer me   i also asked ambassador crocker if the united states congress would have the same opportunity as the iraqi parliament will have to review any agreement or long term security pact that president bush is negotiating with the iraqis  ambassador crocker said that the congress  your representatives  would not have that chance   i have two requests of president bush for his speech on thursday  first  i call on the president to answer the question that general petraeus did not  what is our end game in iraq given the failure of surge to achieve the objective that the president outlined for it  second  i call on president bush to pledge to the american people  who have sacrificed greatly for this effort that the united states congress will have the chance to review and vote on any long term security agreement he has negotiated with the iraqis   president bush must not saddle the next president with an agreement that extends our involvement in iraq beyond his presidency  we have lost more than   of our best sons and daughters  they have given their lives in service to our country in honor and for the objective of giving the iraqi people the greatest gift another human being can bestow   the gift of freedom  tens of thousands of our young men and women have suffered   wounds both visible and invisible   to their bodies  their minds and their hearts   this war has cost more than   trillion if you factor in the lifetime of care and support that is due to our returning veterans  and of course  we must  our ongoing military involvement in iraq has also undermined our efforts in afghanistan and elsewhere  admiral mullen  the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said last week that our continued involvement in iraq has meant we cannot deploy the forces we need to that country   there has been a harsh and daily toll on our men and women in uniform  many of whom are on their second  third  and even fourth tours of duty  among combat troops sent to iraq for the third or fourth time  more than one in four show signs of anxiety  depression or acute stress  according to an official army survey of our soldiers' mental health  and we cannot forget the toll on military families  when fathers and mothers  sons and daughters  husbands and wives sign up to serve our country  their families sign up  too   so it is vital for our national security   and for the health and safety of our men and women in uniform   that we begin to end the war in iraq and rebuild our military  a great pennsylvanian  benjamin franklin once said  'well done is better than well said ' "], ["clinton", "hillary clinton delivered the following remarks at a campaign event in indianapolis  indiana   i grew up in the midwest  born in chicago  raised outside of that great city  i was raised with midwestern values and an unshakeable faith in america and its promise   now  like some of you may have been  i was taken aback by the demeaning remarks senator obama made about people in small town america  senator obama's remarks are elitist and they are out of touch  they are not reflective of the values and beliefs of americans  certainly not the americans that i know   not the americans i grew up with  not the americans i lived with in arkansas or represent in new york   you know  americans who believe in the second amendment believe it's a matter of constitutional rights  americans who believe in god believe it is a matter of personal faith  americans who believe in protecting good american jobs believe it is a matter of the american dream   when my dad grew up it was in a working class family in scranton  i grew up in a church going family  a family that believed in the importance of living out and expressing our faith   the people of faith i know don't  cling to  religion because they're bitter  people embrace faith not because they are materially poor  but because they are spiritually rich  our faith is the faith of our parents and our grandparents  it is a fundamental expression of who we are and what we believe   i also disagree with senator obama's assertion that people in this country  cling to guns  and have certain attitudes about immigration or trade simply out of frustration  people of all walks of life hunt   and they enjoy doing so because it's an important part of their life  not because they are bitter   and as i've traveled across indiana and i've talked to a lot of people  what i hear are real concerns about unfair trade practices that cost people jobs   i think hardworking americans are right to want to see changes in our trade laws  that's what i have said  that's what i have fought for   i would also point out that the vast majority of working americans reject anti immigration rhetoric  they want reform so that we remain a nation of immigrants  but also a nation of laws that we enforce and we enforce fairly   americans are fair minded and good hearted people  we have ups and downs  we face challenges and problems  but our views are rooted in real values  and they should be respected   americans out across our country have borne the brunt of the bush administration's assault on the middle class  contrary to what senator obama says  most americans did much better during the clinton years than they have done during the bush years   if we are striving to bring people together   and i believe we should be   i don't think it helps to divide our country into one america that is enlightened and one that is not   we know there is an unacceptable economic divide in america today  but that is certainly not the way to bridge it  the way to do that is to roll up our sleeves and get to work and make sure we provide  once again  economic opportunity and shared prosperity for all americans   people don't need a president who looks down on them  they need a president who stands up for them  and that is exactly what i will do as your president   because i believe if you want to be the president of all americans  you need to respect all americans  and that starts with respecting our hard working americans  and what we need to do here is to take a lesson from allison transmission "], ["clinton", " b campbell brown  moderator br jon meacham  moderator b b brown b  tonight  we're going to spend about half of our time with senator clinton  about half of our time with senator obama  the order tonight was decided by coin toss  senator clinton won and has elected to go first  questions will come from jon and me and from some of the faith leaders assembled here in our audience  so let's get started  without further ado  please welcome the senator from new york  hillary clinton   b brown b  nice to see you  welcome   applause   b clinton b  thank you  thank you very much   b brown b  senator clinton  welcome to you   b clinton b  thank you   b brown b  jon has got the first question   b clinton b  great  well  it's wonderful to be here  i want to thank messiah college for hosting this  very good of you to do this   applause   b meacham b  senator  we'll start with the news  you have been extremely critical of senator obama's recent comments in san francisco in which he argued that some hard pressed americans have   economically hard pressed americans have  and i quote  gotten bitter and cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti immigrant sentiment or antitrade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations  senator  you have written of how faith sustained you in bitter times  many of us have been sustained by our faith in bitter times  what exactly is wrong with what senator obama had to say   b clinton b  well  i'm going to let senator obama speak for himself  but from my perspective  the characterization of people in a way that really seemed to be elitist and out of touch is something that we have to overcome  you know  the democratic party  to be very blunt about it  has been viewed as a party that didn't understand and respect the values and the way of life of so many of our fellow americans  and i think it's important that we make clear that we believe people are people of faith because it is part of their whole being  it is what gives them meaning in life  through good times and bad times  it is there as a spur  an anchor  to center one in the storms  but also to guide one forward in the day to day living that is part of everyone's journey  and  you know  when we think about the legitimate concerns that people have about trade or immigration  those are problems to be solved  and that's what i think we should be focused on  but i am very confident that  as we move forward tonight and beyond  people will get a chance to get to know each of us a little better  and that's really what i want to talk about  i will leave it to senator obama to speak for himself  he does an excellent job of that  and i will speak for myself on what my faith journey is and what  you know  leads me to this chair here tonight   b brown b  but  senator  you've been out there on the stump attacking him pretty aggressively over this  and his response has been   and he said it pretty bluntly tonight   shame on you  you know that he is a man of faith  this is what he's saying  and to suggest that he is demeaning religion is you playing politics   b clinton b  well  he will have to speak for himself and provide his own explanation  but i do think it raises a lot of concerns and we've seen that exhibited in the last several days by people here in pennsylvania  in indiana where i was yesterday  and elsewhere  because it did seem so much in line with what often we are charged with  someone goes to a closed door fundraiser in san francisco and makes comments that do seem elitist  out of touch and  frankly  patronizing  that has nothing to do with him being a good man or a man of faith  we had two very good men and men of faith run for president in   and   but large segments of the electorate concluded that they did not really understand or relate to or frankly respect their ways of life  and i think that is an issue for voters  as i've heard today from people i visited in scranton and elsewhere  so this is a legitimate political issue  and there are some issues that are not  but this one is  and i do believe that senator obama will have a chance to explain himself tonight  and i'm sure he will take that opportunity   b brown b  let's talk about your faith  and we warned people the questions tonight would be pretty personal  so i want to ask you  you said in an interview last year that you believe in the father  son and the holy spirit  and you have actually felt the presence of the holy spirit on many occasions  share some of those occasions with us   b clinton b  you know  i have  ever since i've been a little girl  felt the presence of god in my life  and it has been a gift of grace that has  for me  been incredibly sustaining  but  really  ever since i was a child  i have felt the enveloping support and love of god and i have had the experiences on many  many occasions where i felt like the holy spirit was there with me as i made a journey  it didn't have to be a hard time  you know  it could be taking a walk in the woods  it could be watching a sunset  you know  i am someone who has talked a lot about my life  you know more about my life than you know about nearly anybody else's  about   books worth   laughter   b clinton b    some of which are  you know  frankly  a little bit off base  but i don't think that i could have made my life's journey without being anchored in god's grace and without having that  you know  sense of forgiveness and unconditional love  and i am not going to point to one or another matter  i mean  some of my struggles and challenges have been extremely public  and i have talked about how i have been both guided and supported through those  trying to find my own way through  because  for me  my faith has given me the confidence to make decisions that were right for me  whether anybody else agreed with me or not  and it is just such a part of who i am and what i have lived through for so many years that trying to pull out and say  oh  i remember  i was sitting right there when i felt  you know  god's love embrace me  would be  i think  trivializing what has been an extraordinary sense of support and possibility that i have had with me my entire life   b meacham b  senator  you   right after new hampshire  you and i had a conversation a couple of days after that in which you described your moment in the setting where you said that you worked very hard and it was seen as a turning point by many people  you described that as a moment of grace   b clinton b  yes   b meacham b  so that is a specific in   b clinton b  right  right  well  you know  jon  it is   it is perhaps a reluctance on my part that is rooted in my personal reserve  rooted in the way i was raised  that i worry and i   you know  i understand you want to ask a lot of personal questions  and i appreciate that  but i also worry  as i suggested to you in that same interview  that you have to walk the walk of faith  and talking about it is important because it's important to share that experience  but i also believe that  you know  faith is just   it's grace  it's love  it's mystery  it's provocation  it is everything that makes life and its purpose meaningful as a human being   b clinton b  and those moments of grace are ones that i cherish and  you know  in asked a specific question about how i felt when i shared my belief that politics is not a game  it is not a who's up  who's down  i mean  it is a serious search and we are so fortunate because we have taken the gifts that god gave us and we have created this democracy where we choose our leaders and we have to be more mindful of how important and serious a business this is  and  therefore  when i say politics is not a game  it is really coming from deep within me because i know that we have the opportunity to really give other people a chance to live up to their own god given potential  and that  to me  is the kind of grace note that makes politics worthwhile  because  believe me  there's a lot about it that is not particularly welcoming or easy  but every day as i travel around the country  i meet people whose faith just knocks me over  i mean  i was with a woman in philadelphia friday morning whose son was murdered on the streets in philadelphia  whose grandson was murdered  and she and i just sat together and she told me about how strong her faith is and how it has sustained her and how she believes  you know  god is with her and she doesn't understand why this happened to her son and her grandson  but every day she's grateful  and she is determined to be the person that she believes god meant her to be  and so when i sit there and i listen to that woman tell me about how it felt and how today she is still  you know  getting up every morning  has a smile on her face  looking to go to her daycare business and take care of all of these children who have been entrusted to her  that's a moment of grace  but it's not about me  i mean  not every moment of grace is about you  more often it is about the interaction and the relationship  you know  grace is that relationship with god  but it's also the relationships with our fellow human beings in which we know grace is present  and so i just feel very fortunate that  you know  i have been able to experience that and i wish it for everyone   b brown b  let's bring a question in from one of the religious leaders joining us tonight  dr  joel hunter  who is senior pastor of the  member northland church in longwood  florida  dr  hunter   b clinton b  how are you  dr  hunter  good to see you   strong pastor joel hunter  northland church   strong i'm fine  senator  good to see you  senator  many of the issues we're going to be talking about tonight  darfur  aids  abortion  torture  could present you with choices that will have life and death consequences for countless people around the world  what are the first principles you fall back on to make such decisions  are there certain activities or references or people with whom you consult in order to do what is morally right   b clinton b  you know  dr  hunter  i think this is one of the challenges that face any of us who are in public life where literally you do have the authority to make these decisions that could very well be life and death decisions and they are daunting and i do not pretend to know how i will deal with every single one of them  but i do have a sense of the process by which i will try to approach them  and it really is rooted in  you know  my prayer  my contemplation  my study  i think you have to immerse yourself in advice  information  criticism from others  i don't pretend to even believe that i know the answers to a lot of these questions  i don't  but i do believe that you have to be willing to expose yourself to many different points of view and then you have to make that decision  i think that for a lot of us  decisions are ones that you don't just make and put on a shelf  to be fair to be constantly struggling and challenging yourself  you have to keep opening up that decision and asking   b clinton b  and very often  as you know  some decisions look like they're  to nothing until you actually examine them  and some decisions truly are right down the middle  and you're not sure which side of the line you will decide upon  you mentioned some of the very difficult decisions that we are going to face  and there are countless more  how do we get out of iraq the right way  everyone knows there is no easy  comfortable decision  i believe we've got to begin taking our troops out of iraq based on my analysis of what i think is the best path forward for us and for the iraqis  but i am deeply aware that there will be predictable and unpredictable consequences  and part of making a decision is having to live with the consequences  and i have been very fortunate in my life to have people whom i feel very comfortable talking to openly  with total frankness  seeking their guidance  they don't all agree with me  they don't all share my view  when i start the conversation  perhaps  but i don't think you can surround yourself only with people with whom you think you will agree  and  for me  being amongst people who challenge me  who make me uncomfortable  to be very blunt  is an important part of my decision making process  i want to push back  i want to argue  i want to raise other hypotheticals and throw them back to see what the outcome is  but at the end of the day  since we are running to be the president of the united states  you have to be comfortable making a decision  because you cannot say  well  let's put it on the back burner and then get back to it some time when it's clearer  for many of these decisions  and then you have to live with the consequences  but i hope i will never  ever find myself being defensive or abrupt and dismissive of people who disagree with me  i regret that that often happens in politics  and maybe it's because oftentimes the decision making process is so exhausting  you know  if you're a person of faith  after you've prayed  if you're a person willing to subject yourself to criticism  after you've done it  you're just so relieved to make the decision you don't want to revisit it  but i don't think that a president can afford to do that   b meacham b  senator  do you believe personally that life begins at conception   b clinton b  i believe that the potential for life begins at conception  i am a methodist  as you know  my church has struggled with this issue  in fact  you can look at the methodist book of discipline and see the contradiction and the challenge of trying to sort that very profound question out  but for me  it is also not only about a potential life  it is about the other lives involved  and  therefore  i have concluded  after great  you know  concern and searching my own mind and heart over many years  that our task should be in this pluralistic  diverse life of ours in this nation that individuals must be entrusted to make this profound decision  because the alternative would be such an intrusion of government authority that it would be very difficult to sustain in our kind of open society  and as some of you've heard me discuss before  i think abortion should remain legal  but it needs to be safe and rare  and i have spent many years now  as a private citizen  as first lady  and now as senator  trying to make it rare  trying to create the conditions where women had other choices  i have supported adoption  foster care  i helped to create the campaign against teenage pregnancy  which fulfilled our original goal   years ago of reducing teenage pregnancies by about a third  and i think we have to do even more   b clinton b  and i am committed to doing that  and i guess i would just add from my own personal experience  i have been in countries that have taken very different views about this profoundly challenging question  some of you know  i went to china in   and spoke out against the chinese government's one child policy  which led to forced abortions and forced sterilization because i believed that we needed to bear witness against what was an intrusive  abusive  dehumanizing effort to dictate how women and men would proceed with respect to the children they wished to have  and then shortly after that  i was in romania and there i met women who had been subjected to the communist regime of the  s and ' s where they were essentially forced to bear as many children as possible for the good of the state  and where abortion was criminalized and women were literally forced to have physical exams and followed by the secret police and so many children were abandoned and left to the orphanages that  unfortunately  led to an aids epidemic  so  you know  when i think about this issue  i think about the whole range of concerns and challenges associated with it and i will continue to do what i can to reduce the number and to improve and increase the care for women and particularly the adoption system and the other opportunities that women would have to make different choices   b brown b  senator  i want to go to the other end of the spectrum and the end of life and ask you  do you believe it is compassionate  that it is appropriate to let someone who is really suffering choose to end their life   b clinton b  again  this is one of those incredibly challenging issues  you know  the terry schiavo case in florida posed that for many people  and it was one of those decisions to go back to dr  hunter's point  where there were people of good faith and people of strong feelings on both sides about what should happen to that woman's life  and i don't know that any of us is in a position to make that choice for families or for individuals  but i don't want us also to condone government action that would legitimize or encourage end of life decisions  somehow there has to be a framework for us to determine how can people who are either able to make these decisions on their own do so  or if they are not  how best do we create a decision process for their families to try to decide  and now we are being faced with a lot of these difficult decisions because of what the world we live in today with modern technology and so much else  and we're going to have to come to grips with them one way or another   b brown b  we've got to take a quick break  a commercial break  we'll be back  much more with senator clinton  right after this   em commercial break   em b brown b  welcome back to the compassion forum  everyone  we're here with senator hillary clinton  and senator  there are a lot of americans who are uncomfortable with the conversation that we're having here tonight  that they believe religion already has way too much influence in political life and public life  how do you reassure them   b clinton b  well  i understand that concern because part of our obligation as leaders in america is to make sure that any conversation about religion is inclusive and respectful  and that has not always happened  as we know  and it is so personal  the spiritual journey that each of us takes or doesn't take  and i think it's important that we recognize that for good cause  i mean  we have been such a vibrant nation when it comes to religious experience in large measure because we've always protected ourselves against  you know  religion going too far  being too intrusive  so it is a balance  and we want religion to be in the public square  if you are a person of faith  you have a right and even an obligation to speak from that wellspring of your faith  but to do so in a respectful and inclusive way  so i understand why some people  even religious people  even people of faith might say  why are you having this forum  and why are you exploring these issues from two people who are vying to be president of the united states  and i think that's a fair question to ask  i am here because i think it's also fair for us to have this conversation  but i'm very conscious of how thoughtful we must proceed   b brown b  another question from the audience  rabbi steve gutow  who is director of the jewish council for public affairs is with us  rabbi   strong rabbi steve gutow  jewish council for public affairs strong  senator clinton   b clinton b  yes  rabbi   strong gutow strong  back to china  china has continued to persecute and subject to oppression the people of tibet  it continues to be the largest supplier of weapons to sudan and the largest purchaser of its oil  let's just say china is not doing all it can to stop the genocide in darfur  you have said that america needs to return to being a moral voice of the world  is our participation in the beijing olympics harmful to that moral voice   b clinton b  well  rabbi  i appreciate your asking this question because i think it's a question of both political and moral significance  and that's why last week i called on our president to decide he would not attend the opening ceremonies of the olympics because that is a public and very obvious ratification of our government's approval of the beijing government's actions   b clinton b  unless the chinese began to take very visible steps to begin to end the suppression of the tibetans and undermining their culture and religious beliefs  and if we could get more cooperation out of the chinese government with respect to sudan  and  of course  i would welcome even more action on behalf of human rights  but the challenge is  how do we try to influence the chinese government  and i believe we have missed many opportunities during the bush administration to do so  in fact  i think it's fair to say our policy toward china is incoherent and that has not been in the best interest of our values or our strategic interest  so i would urge the president at least to consider and  therefore  publicly say that he will not be attending the opening ceremonies  and let's see whether the chinese government begins to respond because that for them would be a great loss of face and perhaps we would get more cooperation  we would get the process going that the dalai lama has asked for over many years  there could be a lot of ways that the chinese government demonstrated it heard our concerns   b brown b  a question from reverend william shaw  he is the president of the national baptist convention  reverend shaw   b clinton b  he is  hello  reverend shaw  good to see you again   strong rev  william j  shaw  national baptist convention strong  senator  current u s  policies toward developing countries   trade policies  make it sometimes extremely difficult for poor people to access inexpensive generic drugs for the treatment of aids and other sicknesses  how would you shape the policies of your administration to ensure that the poor would have access to and could secure the drugs that they need to improve the quality of their lives  of their families and even the future of their country   b clinton b  well  reverend shaw  i agree with your description of this problem  and i believe that our government must do so much more to get generic drugs and low cost drugs to people suffering  not only from hiv aids  but the range of diseases that affect disproportionately the poor  it's one of the reasons why i voted against the free trade agreement with central america  because there was a provision that would give even more power to our pharmaceutical companies to prevent exactly doing what you are discussing  i have been an outspoken advocate in urging that both our great pharmaceutical companies   which do a lot of good  because  after all  they invent the compounds and put them together that the generics then are able to copy  but we need to do much more to get our pharmaceutical companies to work with us to get the drug costs down and to open the pathway for generic drugs  and that's going to take presidential leadership  i commend president bush for his pepfar initiative  it was a very bold and important commitment  but it didn't go far enough in opening up the door to generics and getting the costs down  and as president  i will do that   b meacham b  senator  we've heard about hiv aids  many people here are concerned about darfur and a number of other humanitarian issues  why do you think it is that a loving god allows innocent people to suffer   b clinton b  well   laughter   strong meacham strong  and we just have   seconds   b clinton b  yes  you know  that is the subject of generations of commentary and debate  and i don't know  i can't wait to ask him  because i have   laughter   b clinton b  i have just pondered it endless  endlessly   applause   b clinton b  but i do want to just add that what that means to me is that in the face of suffering  there is no doubt in my mind that god calls us to respond  you know  that's part of what we are expected to do  for whatever reason it exists  its very existence is a call to action  certainly in  you know  our   applause   b clinton b  you know  in my judeo christian faith tradition  in both the old and the new testament  the incredible demands that god places on us and that the prophets ask of us  and that christ called us to respond to on behalf of the poor are unavoidable   b clinton b  and it's always been curious to me how our debate about religion in america too often misses that  you know  his holiness  the pope  is going to be coming to america next week  and he's been a strong voice on behalf of what we must do to deal with poverty  and deal with injustice  and deal with what is truly our obligations toward those who are the least among us  so maybe  you know  the lord is just waiting for us to respond to his call  because this despair  this impoverishment of body and soul is what we are expected to be spending our time responding to  and so few of us do  even those who are doing wonderful work with organizations represented in this audience  we are just not doing enough  and it's a personal call  it's a family community  religious call  and it's a governmental call  and we've got to do more to respond to that call   applause   b brown b  quickly  just now you brought up the bible  we were talking theology  do you have a favorite bible story   b clinton b  oh  i have so many of them  you know  i was fortunate as a child growing up to be read bible stories  to go to sunday school  to go to bible school  and bill and i read  you know  bible stories to chelsea  and  you know  i have talked about bible stories and parables a lot in my life with friends  and  you know  it depends upon what's going on in my life at the time  but clearly  for me  the recent purim holiday for jews raised the question of esther  and i have been   ever since i was a little girl   a great admirer of esther  and i used to ask that that be read to me over and over again  because there weren't too many models of women who had the opportunity to make a decision  to take a chance  a risk that  you know  was very courageous  and so that's the one that's most recently on my mind  because i have some rabbi friends who send me readings that go with the scripture of the week  and certainly  esther is someone who i wish i knew even more about than what we know from the bible   b brown b  a question from eboo patel  who is a muslim  is the founder and executive director of the interfaith youth core  welcome   b clinton b  hello   strong question strong  as salamu alaykum  senator clinton   b clinton b  thank you   strong question strong  my name is eboo patel  i'm an american muslim  and i lead an organization called the interfaith youth core  and it's my privilege to watch a range of faith communities come together around the common value of compassion  americans of all faiths and no faith at all genuinely believe in compassion and want to apply that in addressing global poverty and climate change  can we do that without changing our standard of living   b clinton b  well  i believe there is so much we can do that we're not doing that would not change our standard of living as an imposition from the outside  but which would inspire us to take action that would impact how we live  and i don't think we would notice it demonstrably undermining our standard of living  but it would give us the opportunity to set an example and to be a model  when i think about the simple steps any one of us can take   you know  turning off lights when one leaves a room  unplugging appliances  changing to compact florescent bulbs   you know  my husband and i have done that   i don't think it's impacted our standard of living  but we feel like we're making a small contribution to limiting the amount of greenhouse gas emissions  you know  being more mindful of our purchases  i hope that  as president  i can model that and lead that effort so that people don't feel so threatened by the changes we're talking about when it comes to dealing with global warming  in preparation for the pope's visit  i was reading that the vatican is the first carbon neutral state in the world now  well  that shows leadership  and i don't think it has impacted the work or the living  you know  ambassador flynn  who was our ambassador to the vatican  might know  but it was a great statement  and we can do more   b clinton b  and i think that  with leadership  people will find ways to take those first steps  and then we can take even more  now there's so much that i have to do as president with the cap in trade system  with moving away from our dependence on foreign oil  but i'm going to look for ways that will cushion the costs on middle class and working and poor people  because i don't believe that they should have to bear more than what they are bearing right now as we make this transition  and i believe we can accomplish that   b brown b  let's go to lisa sharon harper  she is the executive director of new york faith and justice  welcome to you   strong lisa sharon harper  n y  faith and justice strong  thank you  senator clinton  underdeveloped nations and regions that lack widespread access to education and basic resources like water  and they tend to be some of the most unstable and dangerous regions of the world  places like pakistan  somalia  sudan  our national security is at stake  but our military is stretched  as president  would you consider committing u s  troops to a purely humanitarian mission under the leadership of a foreign flag   b clinton b  well  let me start by saying  no    i believe strongly that we have to get back to leading on issues like health care and education and women's rights around the world  i have introduced legislation called the education for all act  and it's bipartisan  i introduced it first in '  and then we reintroduced it on a bipartisan basis in '  and the work that i would want to do to have the united states lead the world in putting the   million kids who aren't in school into school  having us lead when it comes to health care  particularly in malaria  tb  hiv aids  but also women's health which has been woefully neglected  i believe we should demonstrate our commitment to people who are poor  disenfranchised  disempowered before we talk about putting troops anywhere  the united states has to be seen again as a peacekeeper  and we have lost that standing in these last seven years  therefore  i want us to have a partnership  government to government  government with the private sector  government with our ngos and our faith community to show the best of what america has to offer  you know  i really appreciated president bush after the tsunami struck  asking his father and my husband to represent the united states and our concern for the people who have been devastated  and  yes  the military was there delivering supplies  that sent a loud message and it was resonating throughout south asia   in indonesia  the largest muslim country in the world  america's favorability rose dramatically because we were seen as caring and compassionate toward those with whom we had very little contact or  in fact  some  you know  level of distrust previously  so i think we have to concentrate first and foremost on restoring our moral authority in the world and our standing in the world  and there are lots of ways that the united states military can be helpful and can show the better face of america  after the pakistan earthquakes  we sent in military teams to help people  so i think that is my emphasis right now  before we get to what we might do hypothetically  let's see what we will do realistically to rebuild america's moral authority and demonstrate our commitment to compassionate humanitarianism   b meacham b  senator  this is our last question for you  to return to faith  do you believe god wants you to be president   b clinton b  well  i could be glib and say we'll find out  but i   i don't presume anything about god  i believe  you know  abraham lincoln was right in admonishing us not to act as though we knew god was on our side  in fact  our mission should be on god's side  and i have tried to take my beliefs  my faith and put it to work my entire life  and it has been gratifying to do the little i've done to try to help other people  which is really what motivates me   b clinton b  that's why i get up in the morning and see whether there's an individual i can help or a problem i can solve  and i wouldn't presume to even imagine that god is going to tell me what i should do  i think that he has given me enough guidance  you know  through how i have been raised and how i have been  thankfully  given access to the bible over so many years  commentary and the like  so i just get up and try to do the best i can  and i think that i see through a glass darkly  i don't believe that any of us know it all and can with any confidence say that we are going to  you know  be doing god's will unless  you know  we are just out there doing our very best  hoping that we make a difference in people's lives  and that's what i am trying to do in this campaign  that's what i would try to do as president  and i couldn't be sitting here had it not been for the  you know  gift of grace and faith that keeps me going and  frankly  challenges me  you know  we haven't talked much about the challenge that faith gives us individually  i really worry when people become very complacent in their faith  when they do believe they have all the answers  because i just don't think it's humanly possible for any of us to know god's mind  i think we are just searching  we are on this journey together  and we need to approach it with a great deal of humility  and that's what i'm trying to do in this campaign  and we'll see what turns out  but whatever happens  i will get up the next day and try to continue on my journey to do what i can to try to fulfill what i believe to be god's expectations of us   b brown b  senator clinton  it was a very different kind of evening  you've been a good sport  thank you   b clinton b  thank you   applause "], ["clinton", "i know that in this audience there are members of the media from new york  including margaret sullivan from the buffalo news and arthur sulzberger from the new york times and others who i don't have on this card  but i am very pleased to be here with all of you  first  i want to say that this speech is entirely off the record  well  you know that those days are long gone  and i am delighted to be back here once again  i was listening to gilbert introduce me and talk about what i said back in   and how times have certainly changed  but i want to thank newspaper publishers collectively for one of my favorite headlines of all time  which has given me great strength and encouragement over the last months   dewey beats truman  and i often recall it as i'm travelling from place to place around our country  i also want to thank you for those of you who have invested in the coverage of this historic campaign  your hard working reporters and columnists are there with us every step of the way  some have literally been on my campaign from the very first days  and they are working extraordinarily hard  given the hours we keep and the miles that we log  and i appreciate your continuing attention to these important issues  just as i do more generally what you do every day to convey to your readership the scope and scale of the challenges and opportunities confronting our nation and our world  i know this is your mission  it's a mission that predates our country but was certainly inscribed into our first amendment  and it is essential that we have you to inform an active citizenry who are the owners and operators of this democracy  i'm also well aware that there are many who are worried  even as we speak  about those who work with you  journalists imprisoned  americans as well as those from other countries  journalists who have been murdered and kidnapped in the course of their work  i was recently at an event held by vital voices honoring mariane pearl whose husband daniel's murder is a horrific and tragic reminder of the dangers that journalists increasingly face in the complex and dangerous globe  so thank you  thank you for what you're doing  thank you also for what you do here at home  there are many stories that have really made a difference  one in particular that i paid a lot of attention to was the washington post's pulitzer prize winning series on the disturbing conditions at walter reed  what was going on there at the outpatient facility was a national disgrace  what was happening took place outside of public scrutiny  and it took a lot of effort to piece the story together  and once that story broke into public consciousness  the public and the public officials began to respond  now  that episode is instructive to me in two ways  it was a lesson about the still very profound power of the traditional press to both serve and shape the public interest  but it was also a reminder of the consequences of presidential power misapplied  misdirected or missing in action  and that's what i would like to discuss with you today  the power and promise of the presidency  and i'd like to begin at the beginning  our constitution instructs the president to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and calls upon the president to swear to preserve  protect and defend the constitution of the united states  the presidency is not royalty  our constitution is crafted carefully to prevent by election what our founders overthrew by revolution  the president is the one elected representative of the whole american people  our president is balanced by the congress  which speaks for regions and states  and by the courts  which defend the individual and other important rights against assaults on our liberties  the president is the only constitutional office holder with the power to speak for all of us and with the potential to unify us in the service of our national interest  unfortunately  our current president does not seem to understand the basic character of the office he holds  rather than faithfully execute the laws  he has rewritten them through signing statements  ignored them through secret legal opinions  undermined them by elevating ideology over facts  rather than defending the constitution  he has defied its principles and traditions  he has abused his power while failing to understand its purpose  this administration's unbridled ambition to transform the executive into an imperial presidency in an attempt to strengthen the office has weakened our nation  it has corrupted and corroded our moral authority and brought our prestige and reputation to its lowest ebb  the president has failed to use the power of the presidency  the power he sought to inflate  to expand opportunity and make a real difference in people's lives  this president seems to believe it's a good day in the white house when the government does little for ordinary americans  that is how this administration defines the presidency  limited government  but unlimited power  well  i have a different view  i believe in the power of the presidency to set big goals for america and to solve the problems of americans  to ensure that our people have the tools they need to turn challenges into opportunities  to fulfill their god given potential  and to build better lives for themselves and their children  that's the kind of president i will be every day in the white house  whether the issue is health care or child care  foreign policy  or the future of our economy  i am running for president because i believe in the promise of america and i believe in the power of the presidency to help fulfill that promise  now  that's not a sound bite  it's what i have learned  experienced and intended  as best i could  throughout my life  i've had many opportunities  i've been blessed  and i understand that those blessings came from the hard work of my parents  my teachers  others in the village that surrounded and helped to nurture and raise me  my church  which helped to guide me  and  of course  the positive actions of my government that directly affected my life  as a young girl  i could not go to certain colleges  compete for certain scholarships  participate  if i'd had the sporting ability  in certain sports  or obtain some kind of financial aid for playing them  there were certain jobs that were closed to me and other young women  and the horizons were not quite as broad as those for my brothers  i grew up in a middle class family  at a time when our nation was investing in the middle class  after world war ii  my father started a small business  saved up enough money to purchase a home  he  like so many veterans coming back from world war ii  were anxious to get on with their lives  he moved us to a suburb where he paid taxes for better schools  and where our nation made unprecedented investments in public education  i was able to go to college and then to law school because the federal government wanted to make investments in young people  and so  when i went to law school  unable to get any financial help from my family  i worked  i had a small scholarship  and i borrowed money from the federal government at about   interest  and i and so many others had a chance to pursue our academic dreams because our government wanted us to  as i have seen over the last years in public life as a senator from new york and now as a candidate for the presidency how many families and how many young people don't have any confidence or any reason to believe that their government cares about their future  i believe that we have to change that  the magnitude of the problems be fore us present a unique challenge and chance to bring this generation of americans together  to fulfill our common purpose  and finding the nation to do so is the responsibility of our president  nine months from now  a few days  we will have a new president taking the oath of office from the steps of the capitol  that new president will inherit the job at a time of unprecedented challenges and stress  our economy is at risk of a deep and painful recession threatening the opportunities for millions of americans to fond and keep jobs that are satisfying and well paid  to buy their own homes or keep the ones they have  send their children to college  to save for retirement  even to afford their health care premiums  their gas bills  their utility bills  and so much else that makes up a middle class lifestyle here in our country  our health care system is in crisis  it threatens not only the health of our families but the opportunities for our businesses as they compete in the global marketplace  our security is threatened by the interconnected dangers of extremism  terrorism  rogue regimes  and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  and certainly by the ongoing war in iraq and the climate crisis that does threaten our way of life  that's why it is so important that in this election we restore balance and purpose to the presidency as the first step to restore opportunity and moral authority in america  i believe i bring a unique set of experiences to this mission  one  of my lifetime of work going back   years  and my incredible opportunities now on both ends of pennsylvania avenue  i have seen what happens when a president tries and succeeds on some fronts  but fails on others  i certainly witnessed and was part of the consequences of a process to create universal health care that was viewed as too insulated from people and their representatives in congress  but i also participated in and helped to bring about successes  like the children's health insurance program which was a bipartisan accomplishment  i watched as my husband made other important progressive steps on behalf of america  as a senator  i've seen how working with congress as a president makes a real difference  and the absence of presidential involvement leaves a vacuum  congress's role in deliberating on legislation may not always bring people together who do not agree  but it is essential that the process be recognized and respected  i have worked hard to hold this administration accountable because all too often the president has failed to share information with the congress  to be willing to recognize the checks and balances that have certainly been a blessing to our system of government for so many years  i will bring most of my time in the white house and now my time in the senate  some critical lessons to the presidency  first  i will restore faith in our government by resorting integrity to our government  for seven years  this administration has exhibited ideological disdain for government  and because they view government with contempt  they treat it with contempt  they don't believe government can or should be a source for the public interest  so they treat it as a source of favors for private interests  as president i will restore an old fashioned idea   appointing qualified people to positions in government again  i will immediately begin implementing an agenda of reform to end no bid contracts  to close the revolving door between public sector work and private sector lobbying  to restore fiscal responsibility  to modernize our government  and to open its books to greater scrutiny  second  i will restore openness in government  when i am president  the era of bush cheney secrecy will be over  on april  th    president kennedy addressed one of the predecessors of this association  the american newspaper publishers association  the failed invasion of cuba known as the bay of pigs had taken place just one week before  president kennedy spoke of the threat threatening the united states  he wrestled publicly with the basic tension that exists whenever our security is threatened between the government's responsibility to keep some secrets and the public's right to know  but he understood the importance of openness to the integrity and vitality of government even in the aftermath of his own failures  he said   there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions  just days after an embarrassing failure  the president of the united states came before your predecessors  begged for scrutiny  and challenged the nation to mobilize without compromising democratic values  that kind of open leadership has been sorely lacking these past seven years  in fact the bush administration has dramatically widened the definition of classified information to shield more and more materials from public scrutiny  has widened the scope of the states secrets privilege to shield this program from judicial review  and has widened the reach of executive privilege to shield its activated from congress  from warrantless wiretaps at home to secret prisons overseas  the bush administration has conducted illegal activities and stonewalled efforts of the people and the congress to discover them and to hold the administration accountable  when i am president i will empower the federal government to operate from a presumption of openness  not secrecy  that's why i am a co sponsor of the free flow of information act  allowing reporters to protect sources  help insure that whistle blowers can blow the whistle  and you can keep the public informed and keep office holders accountable  i will direct my administration to prevent needless classification of information that ought to be shared with the public  we will adopt a presumption of openness and freedom of information act requests and urge agencies to release information quickly if disclosure will do no harm  it was attorney general janet reno's approach  and it will be my attorney general's approach  as well  third  because solving problems starts by recognizing facts  i will restore evidence based decision making to our government  a free and open society depends upon evidence based inquiry  shortly after i arrived in the senate  it became abundantly clear to me that the white house had very little interest in facts or evidence and i started saying in speeches on the floor and in other settings that they wanted to turn washington into an evidence free zone  unfortunately  they have succeeded all too well and we will have to reverse that  this administration has also waged a war on science  rewriting scientific reports  allowing politicians to overrule and silence government researchers  politicizing important decisions affecting our environment and our public health  i will stop political appointees from manipulating the government's scientific conclusions and prevent the suppression of public statements from government scientists  i will put in place new whistleblower protections for scientists who step forward to protest political interference  our government will once again value and encourage scientific discovery and open inquiry  and we will regain our place as the world's leading innovation nation  fourth  because government abuse is checked by the separation of powers  i will restore respect for our co equal branches of government  i'll start by limiting the excessive executive powers this president has accumulated  like the unilateral power to wiretap  or detain try people  even american citizens  i will work with congress again as a partner to solve problems  i'll end the use of signing statements to rewrite the laws that congress has passed  i'll shut down guantanamo  disavow torture and restore the right of habeas corpus  i will end the practice of using executive privilege as a shield against the public's right to know and congress' duty to oversee the president  finally i will make crystal clear that the president and the executive branch will comply with the laws of our nation  my department of justice will interpret those laws fairly accurately honestly and publically  we'll release justice department interpretations so that you know exactly what our understanding is and how laws are being executed  the president is not above the law in our system of government and we need to make that absolutely clear starting next year  these changes both represent and drive the transformation i believe is needed in our government starting on day one of my administration  i do not believe that power is an end in itself but a means  a means limited in scope of serving the interest and protecting the safety of our nation  while creating opportunity for our people  but the question before us is deeper than how the next president will restore our government and our constitution  the question is how the next president will employ our government  i am here and i am running for president because i have seen the promise of america and i do understand the promise of the presidency and on day one i will bring my hard won experience  whatever strength and knowledge i posses to fulfill that promise  i will start by trying to live up to the model described by teddy roosevelt    all that in me lies to do will be done to make my work a success  and i plan to hit the ground running starting on day one and throughout my first   days  during that time i will call on congress to send to my desk the bills the president vetoed  from supporting stem cell research to expanding children's health care and i will sign them  allowing scientists to better explore the promise of new cures for disease  diseases like parkinson's  alzheimer's  diabetes and so much else  and we will provide health insurance for millions more of our children as a down payment on achieving health care for all americans with no exceptions  my administration will call together meeting of mortgage lenders  banks  community organizations and regulators to negotiate an immediate freeze on foreclosures  because so many americans are hurting and the projection is that more than   million families will be foreclosed on this year  i will call for a timeout on new trade agreements and review all existing trade agreements and i will call on canada and mexico to work with me to renegotiate nafta  my budget to congress will restore fiscal sanity while cutting taxes for middle class families to the tune of   billion dollars a year  ending tax breaks for oil companies  drug companies  insurance companies  wall street and others to the tune of   billion dollars a year  i will work with congress to introduce a comprehensive immigration bill  my administration convene a summit within   days to negotiate a new climate change treaty to replace kyoto and one that includes china  india and other rapidly developing and very big green house gas emitting nations  i will work with the congress to submit a comprehensive energy bill that will move us toward ending our dependence on foreign oil and increasing the percentage of renewable fuels we use to produce electricity  i will overturn the global gag rule to allow nongovernmental organizations to practice free speech and use other funding sources to provide women with access to the full range of reproductive health care around the world  i will call a meeting of the joint chiefs of staff and demand that the pentagon draw up plans to begin withdrawing troops from iraq responsibly and carefully starting within   days of my inauguration  i will reach out to the rest of the world and ask distinguished americans of both parties to be emissaries on our behalf traveling across the globe telling both governments and people that the united states is willing once again to work with you to try to find common ground on our problems from global warming to global terrorism to global epidemics  i will sign executive orders ending the war on science  ordering the closure of guantanamo  reversing many of the anti labor provisions that president bush adopted and looking very clearly at what we have to do to rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class in our country  in short  starting from day one  the bush cheney era will be over in name and in practice  we are fortunate in our country that we get to overturn our government peacefully and thoroughly  the question is the path we select at such an important juncture  i know this campaign has gone on a long time  but elections do end and when the campaigns conclude and the banners are town down and the speeches are finally finished  all that's left is the choice we have made  we have seen the power of the presidency placed in hands unready or unwilling to address the paths that lie ahead  jus think of the days after september  th  imagine if president bush had tapped into the wellspring of american energy  initiative and goodwill  the president could've launched a manhattan project for renewable energy  the president could have called on our young people to serve in the peace corps or americorps help to start what i've advocated  a green corps  the president could've said we need to reach out to the rest of the world because clearly the world needs to be as committed to ending acts of horrific terrorism as we are  the president could have responded to our health challenges by investing in public health here and around the world  the president could've said we need to be smarter about how we engage with the rest of the world so let us lead in trying to make education more universally available to the   million children who are shut out  including in countries like pakistan where too often the young boys are then turned over for indoctrination to the madrassas because there are no alternative  the president literally could have access to do anything  called on our patriotism and our unity  but he only asked us to draw on our wallets and go shopping  we have also seen throughout our history the power of the presidency placed in hands ready to transform our nation for the better  to call upon those better angels of our nature  to summon the unique and wonderful spirit that sets america apart and carries forward  constantly believing that tomorrow can be better than today  we've overcome tyranny  we've ended the injustice of slavery  we've expanded civil rights and women's rights  we've endured and grown stronger through the depression and world wars  and yes  we have become a much better and fairer country for all that we have done on behalf of those who were initially left our of our constitution or who lacked even the basic power to organize for themselves  throughout our history we have achieved in those moments improbable and even impossible triumphs  and each time we have rediscovered the boundless forces of american strengths and character  that is what we must do again  in a message to congress from the citizens of america at the onset of the civil war  president lincoln called upon our nation to save itself   it is a struggle  he said   for maintaining in the world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men  to lift artificial weights from all shoulders  to clear the path of laudable pursuit for all  to afford all an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life  those are the stakes  in your hands rest an awesome responsibility   to inform us and educate us  and to help us be committed to that race that lies ahead  we must not turn away from the urgency of our times and the immediacy of the tasks before us  i know that we are fully up to it  i have no doubt  no matter how daunting it may seem  there is no one who can count us out if we are willing and able to rise and meet the challenges and seize the opportunities before us  it would be a grave abdication of our birthright  of our history as americans were we to do any less  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", "thank you so much  thank you all  thank you  thank you very  very much  oh  thank you  it's a long road to   pennsylvania avenue and it runs right through the heart of pennsylvania  for six weeks senator obama and i have crisscrossed this state  meeting people up close  being judged side by side  making our best case  you listened and today you chose  with two wars abroad and an economic crisis here at home  you know the stakes are high and the challenges are great  but you also know the possibilities  those possibilities are endless  if we roll up our sleeves and get to work with a president who is ready to lead on day one  that means ready to take charge as commander in chief and make this economy work for middle class families  and i thank you  i thank you  pennsylvania  for deciding i can be that president  for me  the victory we share tonight is deeply personal  it was here in pennsylvania where my grandfather started work as a boy in the lace mills and ended up as a supervisor five decades later  it was here where my father attended college and played football for penn state  and i am back here tonight because of their hard work and sacrifice  and i only wish they could have lived to see this moment  because in this election i carry with me not just their dreams  but the dreams of people like them and like you all across our country   people who embrace hard work and opportunity  who never waver in the face of adversity  who stand for what you believe and never stop believing in the promise of america  i'm in this race to fight for you  to fight for everyone who has ever been counted out  for everyone fighting to pay the grocery bills or the medical bills  the credit card and mortgage payments  and the outrageous price of gas at the pump today  you know  the pundit's question whether pennsylvanians would trust me with this charge and tonight you showed you do  you know you can count on me to stand up strong for you every single day in the white house  this has been a historic race and i commend senator obama and his supporters tonight  we are  in many ways  all on this journey together to create an america that embraces every last one of us  the women in their nineties who tell me they were born before women could vote and they're hopeful of seeing a woman in the white house  the mothers and fathers at my events  who lift their little girls on their shoulders and whisper in their ears   see  you can be anything you want  tonight  more than ever  i need your help to continue this journey  this is your campaign and this is your victory tonight  your support has meant the difference between winning and losing  we can only keep winning if we can keep competing with an opponent who outspends us so massively  so  i hope you'll go to hillaryclinton com and show your support tonight because the future of this campaign is in your hands  some people counted me out and said to drop out  but the american people don't quit and they deserve a president who doesn't quit either  tonight all across pennsylvania and america  teachers are grading papers and doctors and nurses are caring for the sick  and you deserve a leader who listens to you  waitresses are pouring coffee and police officers are standing guard and small businesses are working to meet that payroll  and you deserve a champion who stands with you  and of course  all across the world  our men and women in uniform  some on your second  third or fourth tour of duty  you deserve a commander in chief who will finally bring you home and who will rebuild our strained military  do whatever it takes to care for our veterans wounded in both body and spirit  today  here in pennsylvania  you made your voices heard and because of you  the tide is turning  we were up against a formidable opponent who outspent us three to one  he broke every spending record in this state trying to knock us out of the race  well  the people of pennsylvania had other ideas tonight  the presidency is the toughest job in the world  but the pressures of a campaign are nothing compared to the pressures of the white house  and today  pennsylvanians looked through all the heat and saw the light of a brighter tomorrow   a tomorrow of shared prosperity and restored world leadership for peace  security  and cooperation  after seven long years of president bush  we've got our work cut out for us and we don't have a minute to waste  so  it's high time we stop talking about our problems and start solving them and that is what my campaign is all about  all through this campaign  i have offered solutions  solutions for good jobs you can raise a family on  jobs that can't be shipped overseas  and on earth day  clean  renewable green jobs that can put us on the right track to the future  solutions for independence from foreign oil and exploding gas prices  quality affordable healthcare not just for many americans or most americans but for every single american  no exceptions and no excuses  affordable college and real improvements in public schools  not the failure that is no child left behind  we're going to end the war on science and have a renewed commitment to science and research  we will tackle everything from autism to alzheimer's  cancer to diabetes  and make a real difference  i look forward to discussing all of these issues with the people of indiana  north carolina and the states that i'll be visiting in the coming weeks  not long ago a woman handed me a photograph of her father as a young soldier  he was receiving the medal of honor from president truman at the white house  during world war ii  he had risked his life on a daring mission to drive back the enemy and protect his fellow soldiers  in the corner of that photo  in shaky handwriting  this american hero had simply written   to hillary clinton  keep fighting for us  and that is what i'm going to do because america is worth fighting for  you are worth fighting for  it was in this city that our founders declared america's independence and our permanent mission to form a more perfect union  neither senator obama nor i nor many of you were fully included in that vision  but we've been blessed by men and women in each generation who saw america not as it is  but as it could and should be  the abolitionists and the suffragists  the progressives and the union members  the civil rights leaders  all those who marched  protested and risked their lives because they looked into their children's eyes and saw the promise of a better future  because of them  i grew up taking for granted that women could vote  because of them  my daughter grew up taking for granted that children of all colors could attend school together  and because of them and because of you  this next generation will grow up taking for granted that a woman or an african american can be the president of the united states of america  i am so honored by the support and the hospitality of all of the people of pennsylvania  i want to especially thank governor rendell and mayor nutter  lieutenant governor catherine baker knoll and the state treasurer robin wiessmann and state party chair t j  rooney  these are great leaders and dear friends  as are my friends from the congress  representatives murtha  sestak  schwartz and kanjorski  their support means the world to me and the support of   mayors across this commonwealth and so many other state and local leaders who worked hard for this victory tonight  i want to thank my friends in our labor unions for standing with us every step of the way  and my outstanding staff  volunteers and supporters here in pennsylvania and across america  i especially want to thank my family for their incredible love and support  bill and chelsea have crisscrossed pennsylvania from one end to the other  my brothers hugh and tony who love pennsylvania with all their hearts  from our childhood summers in lake winola  and my mother who is with us tonight  we still have a lot of work ahead of us  but if you're ready  i'm ready  i might stumble and i might get knocked down  but as long as you'll stand with me i will always get right back up  because for me  in the end  the question isn't whether we can keep america's promise  it's whether we will keep america's promise  so let me ask you tonight   will we once again be the can do nation  the nation that defies the odds and does the impossible  will we break the barriers and open the doors and lift up all of our people  will we reach out to the world and lead by the power of our ideals again  will we take back the white house and take back our country  i believe with all of my heart that together we will turn promises into action  words will become solutions  hope will become reality  so my answer to any who doubt is  yes  we will  thank you and god bless you "], ["clinton", "thank you  indiana  thank you  not too long ago  my opponent made a prediction  he said i would probably win pennsylvania  he would win north carolina  and indiana would be the tie breaker  well  tonight we've come from behind  we've broken the tie  and thanks to you  it's full speed on to the white house  this has been an extraordinary experience  traveling across indiana  having an opportunity to meet so many of you  and for everyone who holds your breath at the gas pump  afraid to see how much it cost today  and for everyone working day and night because you want the world for your kids  for every young person with big dreams who deserves a world of opportunity  and for all those who aren't in the headlines but have always written america's story  tonight is your victory right here  i want to commend senator obama and his supporters on their win in north carolina  we are  in many ways  on the same journey  it's a journey begun long before we were born  it is a journey by men and women who have been on a mission to perfect our union  who marched and protested  who risked everything they had to build an america that embraces us all  and tonight  once again  i need your help to continue our journey  this has always been your campaign and this is your victory  because your support has meant the difference between winning and losing  and we can only keep winning if we're able to keep competing against an opponent who does outspend us massively  so i hope you will go to hillaryclinton com and support our campaign  this is a very touching moment for me  i grew up in the midwest  born in chicago  raised in park ridge  illinois  my dad was a world war ii vet who started his own small business  and originally from scranton  pa  that's right  my mother had a difficult childhood  but worked hard to provide a loving home for us  and she didn't attend college herself  but was determined her children would  and i don't think she ever dreamed she would see a night like this  their story  like every one of our stories  is the american story  it's a story of men and women who embrace opportunity  never waver in the face of adversity  and never stop believing in the promise of america  and yet today  i have met so many people here in indiana and across america who feel invisible  you sure feel invisible when you're paying   or   to fill up your tank  you feel invisible when the money you took to the grocery store no longer meets your needs for the next week  you feel invisible when your health insurance disappears and college is out of reach  and you can't believe how invisible you feel when your loved one who served our country in war is ill served back at home  i know these stories and i see you and i hear you  and i know how hard you're working  working for yourselves and working for your families  and i will never stop fighting for you  so that you can have the future you deserve  tonight  hoosiers have said that you do want a president who stands strong for you  a president who is ready on day one to take charge as commander in chief and keep our families safe  a president who knows how to make this economy work for hardworking middle class families  and there are a lot of ideas about how best to do that  because we need all of the good common sense that americans have to offer  i know that we have got an important debate going on right now about how we are going to help families deal with these gas prices  they have gone up so fast  so out of sight in the minds of the people that i talk with and i think it's time that we really had a concerted strategy  you've heard me say this and i'll say it again  i think its time to give americans a break this summer and to make the oil companies pay the gas tax out of their record profits  i say it's time to cover every single american with health insurance  and i say it's time to freeze foreclosures for families most at risk of losing their homes  including our soldiers who are in harm's way and are being foreclosed on here in america  fundamentally  i believe that americans need a champion in their corner  that for too long we've had a president who has stood up and spoke out for the wealthy and the well connected  but i don't think that's what americans need or what they're looking for now  and i think standing up for working people is about the american dream and the democratic party  and i think standing up for the middle class is about who we are and who we can be if we stick together  so it is important that as we go forward in this campaign that we recognize we are all on the same team  we are going to be standing up for you  we're going to be looking for a way to turn this country around and bring it back to what it should stand for and be all about   better futures for you and your children  solving the problems that affect us here in america  i know that people are watching this race and they're wondering  i win  he wins  i win  he wins  it's so close  and i think that says a lot about how excited and passionate our supporters are and how intent so many americans are to really taking their country back  but i can assure you  as i have said on many occasions that no matter what happens  i will work for the nominee of the democratic party  because we must win in november  and i know that senator obama feels the same way  because we have been on this campaign trail now for a long time  and we know how desperately people want to see a change  and it will not be a change if the republicans keep the white house  it will be more of the same  something that no one  no matter what political party you may be  can afford  it is time for all of us to recognize what is at stake in this election  not just for democrats as we decide who will be our nominee  but for all americans  the soldiers and the veterans that i meet  they always say to me  promise you'll take care of my buddies  they rarely ask for themselves  and they need a president who will take care of them  and when i talk with the people who come to rallies and events like this  very often it's with a bit of hesitation that they tell me they've lost their job  they've lost their health care  they can't afford to go to college  and it just breaks my heart  because when i think about the america that i grew up in  the future was unlimited  the potential was there for all of us if we were willing to work hard and do our part  so this journey that we're on together is one that has been a blessing for me  because i know what this country has meant to me and i know what it still means to all of you  it is now our responsibility to ensure that it will always mean the same for our children and our grandchildren  i will never give up on you and on your families and on your dreams and on your future  and i want to thank the people of indiana for your hospitality and your vote of confidence and i especially want to thank your wonderful senator  evan bayh  evan is an outstanding leader for this state and for america  he's been your governor  he's now your senator  he's someone whom i look to for advice and counsel  he's worked tirelessly on this campaign and i'm so grateful to him and his wonderful wife susan  i also want to thank the people of north carolina  who were so hospitable and gracious to us  and i especially want to thank mike and mary easley for their friendship and support  governor easley is a visionary leader for north carolina and we had so much fun campaigning in the tar heel state  and while we are celebrating tonight  i would like to take a moment to express my deepest sympathies to the victims of the devastating cyclone in burma  our hearts and prayers go out to the people there and i call upon the junta that has ruled burma for so many years to please let the rest of the world in to help  this is a time when everyone should be there to lift up those who are affected by this deadly storm  and i want to thank all of my friends who have worked so hard  i want to thank my friends in labor  i want to thank my staff  my volunteers and my supporters  and i especially want to thank my family for their incredible love and support  bill and chelsea  people ask us all the time  how do you keep going  we love getting out and meeting people  we love having a chance to be with all of you  and didn't chelsea do a great job  i know a lot of people enjoyed seeing my husband again out on the campaign trail  so now it is on to west virginia  kentucky  oregon  and the other states where people are eager to have their voices heard  for too long  we've let places like west virginia and kentucky slip out of the democratic column  well  it's time for that to change and these next primaries are another test  i'm going to work my heart out in west virginia and kentucky this month and i intend to win them in november in the general election  i want the people in these upcoming states to know we are going to work hard to reach out to all of you  because we want you to know that the democratic party is your party  and a democratic president will be good for you  so please  come join us in our campaign  and i am running to be the president of all of america   north  south  east and west  and everywhere in between  that's why it is so important that we count the votes of florida and michigan  it would be a little strange to have a nominee chosen by   states  we've got a long road ahead  but we're going to keep fighting on that path for america  because america is worth fighting for  and we believe in america's potential and possibility that has so ignited hope and the dreams of people throughout our country and around the world  people who left everything behind in order to come here and be part of this great experiment in democracy  dissidents and dreamers on every continent who look to us and our ideals for their hope and inspiration  all those around the world who wept for us and prayed for us on september  th  who laid wreaths and flew flags at half mast and printed that unforgettable headline   we are all americans  that is the reach of america's embrace  through time  place and history  and i know we can once again open our arms to the world  we can once again be the can do nation  a nation that defies the odds and greets the future with optimism and hope  there isn't anything america can't do once we make up our minds to start acting like americans again  and that is exactly what we intend to do  thank you  and god bless you and god bless america "], ["clinton", "good afternoon  oh my goodness  this is just such a pleasure and we are thrilled to be here  what better place to spend mother's day than here in grafton  not far from the andrews methodist church  where the very first mother's day was celebrated   years ago  so this is the hundredth anniversary and i want to thank all of you for spending part of this day with us here at the b and o railroad heritage center  i want to thank the county commission president dave goebel for being here and all the elected officials who are here with us  it is exciting to be here with my daughter too  because whether you're a son or a daughter  or in fact  a father or a mother  or maybe a grandfather or a grandmother '' or even a great grandparent  you know that you're part of an ongoing celebration every mother's day that began as a simple commemoration of a west virginia woman and that's what i think is so special  when i walked through the home and saw where ann maria reeves jarvis lived  and there's so much there that is authentic and of period  it really did touch my heart  i was told by tom and olive who were taking us through that people come sometimes every mother's day  they bring friends and relatives from out of the area to experience this real walk back through history  i was inspired when i first read about ann maria and how she worked so hard to raise her family like so many women in those days  she had ten children but only four survived  she taught sunday school  i also learned that she was a methodist like i am and her husband was a baptist like my husband  for   years of marriage they never went to church together  well  bill and i have done that a few times  they eventually  under the leadership of ann maria  organized what were called mothers' work days and they worked to improve sanitation and health conditions and raise funds for medicine  and try to care for women with tuberculosis  they inspected bottled milk and food and treated wounded soldiers  both yankee and confederate  the upstairs bedroom  which is the guest bedroom  there is both the grey and the blue on the bedspread because they cared for any wounded soldier  it was safe passage if they made it to the jarvis home  that was very inspiring to me  she had a tremendous sense of duty and obligation and her story might have been lost in history had her own daughter not come forward with the idea of mother's day and to honor her and all mothers for the contributions  so as we look at the mothers and the grandmothers who are gathered here today and as we think about the tens of millions of mothers across our country who are busy taking care of their children  doing their jobs  supporting their communities and living lives of faith and service  we are reminded from generation to generation that our progress often come from the hard work  determination and the tenacity of women  i wanted to begin by saluting my own mother who couldn't be here  because my mother  as some of you may have heard me say or read in my book  didn't have the benefit of a stable family growing up  her parents were unable to care for their two young daughters and were divorced in the  s which wasn't very comment back then  my eight year old mother and her five year old sister were sent away on a train all by themselves from chicago to california to live with grandparents who had little interest in raising them  so when my mother was about   she left that home and was hired as a live'in helper by a woman who encouraged and supported her  my mom took care of the children in the morning  got them off to school  then she could go to high school  she would come right back and take care of them when the kids got home from school  she never had the chance to go to college  but she was determined that her own children would have that chance  as i grew older and learned more about my mother's own story  it really impressed upon me more fully what it took for her to forge ahead in the face of life's challenges  i saw how hard she worked every single day to support my father and our family  to raise me and my brothers  and to be involved in teaching sunday school to helping out at the neighborhood school  my mother didn't have the luxury to put up her feet and take a breather  she just kept going  kept working  kept meeting her responsibilities and pursuing her dreams for her children so that we could have opportunities that she  and prior generations  never ever dreamed of  she wasn't alone  judging from the mothers i meet across our country  i've come to believe that hard work  determination and resiliency are encoded in our dna  we know we have the  worrying  gene  we know we have the  put your coat on because it's cold outside  gene  well  we also have the  stand up and fight for what you believe in  gene  take  for example  my grandmother  my father's mother  hannah jones  she was a formidable woman  she died when i was quite young but i have vivid memories of her  she was the kind of woman who never took no for an answer  and one time  when my father and a friend were hitching a ride on the back of an ice truck  and their feet were dangling over the back of it  the truck came to an abrupt halt and skidded and smashed into something crushing my father's feet  he was rushed to the hospital  word went out to hannah that her son had been seriously injured  she got to the hospital only to be met by doctors who said that they had to amputate his feet  hannah said no  and she barricaded my father and herself in their hospital room  would not let anyone in until her brother'in'law who happened to be a doctor arrived and then she basically browbeat him into agreeing to save my father's feet  my father went on to play football in high school and college  they did a good job  i think  but if it hadn't been for that mother saying  no  you're not going to do this  my father's life would have been so much different  so when i think of hannah  i think of the mother who is working to help her child who is labeled a failure in school until he finally experiences success  i think of the mother who petitions the mayor or the city council or the police chief to demand more protection for children when they are outside playing in the neighborhood  or the mother who takes matters into her own hands and sends body armor to her son or daughter in iraq when the military didn't provide it  this is not a new phenomenon  women have been standing up for what we believe in  defying convention  and going forward for a long time  what about the brave suffragists who didn't abandon their fight for the right to vote even when they were ostracized and harassed and thrown in jail  what about harriet tubman  who wouldn't back down in the face of danger as she led slaves out of bondage on an underground railroad  what about dolores huerta  who helped to found the united farm workers and worked long and very unglamorous hours as a grassroots activist to bring dignity to the lives of other mothers  what about sally ride  who wouldn't give up her dream of soaring into space when women were told they didn't have the  right stuff  to become astronauts  what about the women around the world like the extraordinary ellen johnson sirleaf  who became the president of liberia in   and whose leadership has literally helped to mother a wounded and suffering nation  i find inspiration from all of these women and from their stories and i find inspiration as i travel around west virginia and america  i find inspiration from the mothers and grandmothers i meet every single day  i was in indiana toward the end of the campaign  in fact it was the very last event we did in evansville  we were in a high school gym  hundreds of people were there and after i spoke i was shaking hands and i came upon a beaming glowing mother  standing next to the wheelchair which her son  who was incredibly  profoundly disabled  she introduced me with such love and pride to her son  and he could be well understood by me but she could understand everything he was saying  she proceeded to interpret for him how excited he was about this campaign  and how he knew exactly what i was saying across indiana  jobs  jobs  jobs  and he said it over and over and over again  i think of all of these mothers who take whatever life throws at us  gets up every morning  gets the kids ready for school  does the laundry  buys the groceries  cooks the dinners  helps on the homework and maybe works a day shift  a nightshift or a double shift  and mothers who tell their daughters  you are just as smart and capable as anyone else and don't ever think you aren't  women who ask the pta  why don't we do more to get girls into math and science classes  women who dare to compete in the board room and the back room  the locker room and the newsroom  the halls of academia and the corridors of political power  through their perseverance and resilience these women are standing up for the bedrock principle of american democracy '' the promise of opportunity for anyone who is willing to work hard and pursue their dreams  that is a principle and a promise that must always include girls and women  now  if you are a woman of a certain age  as i am  you have likely experienced a moment along the way when your own sense of limitless possibility collided with a harsher reality  for me  it was a small moment  i was a teenager  i dreamed of being an astronaut  so i wrote to nasa to volunteer for astronaut training and find out what you had to do to be prepared  i got a letter back  girls were just not accepted into the program  the truth is  given my poor eyesight and very  very modest athletic abilities  i would have never been accepted in any event  but the rejection  however small  carried a message  i hadn't realized until then that anyone be denied an opportunity simply on the basis of being a girl  later  in a class of   students at law school  i was one of only   women enrolled  at that time the largest group ever  today women are the majority of students in law school  but i remember when i was just starting my legal career and a colleague advised me not to be a trial lawyer because  he said  i had no way of getting the one thing every trial lawyer needed  when i asked him what  he said   a wife  i said   really  very seriously he said   when you're in a long trial and you're busy  who's going to make sure you have clean socks for court  i had honestly never thought of that and i had always washed my socks myself  so it didn't seem like it would be that big an obstacle  thankfully  i  like generations of women today  are able to make our own choices because other women stood up and demanded that for us  i often think about how much lives have changed for women since when my own mother was born in   when i was born in   and when chelsea was born in   we've made an enormous amount of progress  women are now neurosurgeons and nascar drivers  judges and generals  ceos and cpas  but it's also true that the higher you go up in the ranks  the thinner it becomes  whether it's business  or law  or politics  or other fields  women still face a lot of barriers  some visible  some invisible  in   it's really important we recommit ourselves to making sure that our daughters and our sons have an equal chance to lead and serve in the future  over the past few days i've gotten emails from around the country from people offering words of encouragement and advice  one man from california wrote   keep fighting  no matter what the outcome may be  the fact that you stood throughout the constant ups and downs in this race  one thing is sure  you never wavered and you never gave up  a woman named linda said  linda wrote and said   don't give up  i'm supporting you looking at my girls and knowing that when the going gets tough  you keep forging ahead  a californian wrote   for the sake of all future and current mothers everywhere  keep your head up and keep on in this race  keep fighting  i am with you all the way  but i guess my favorite message was from a woman named angela   keep strong  she said   it's not over until the lady in the pantsuit says it is  i share that  because the underlying lesson is not so much about me but about all of us  about whether or not we do stay with what we start  whether or not we can make progress if we don't commit ourselves to it and see it through  unless we are wiling to stand in the face of adversity  the same is true for our country  we need to rise to the challenges facing us  no matter how daunting  and take care of the unfinished business before america  unfinished business that resonates not only for women but for all of us   for children whose lives and well'being is affected because their mother is paid lower wages than male counterparts doing the same job  for husbands who share the burdens placed on a family when a woman can't get maternity leave or get a bank loan or qualify for a decent pension  for fathers who want their daughters to have the same opportunities as their sons ' to compete at sports  or be engineers  or fly jets or break any barrier to be whatever they dream  including president of the united states  it's unfinished business that we see everyday in the headlines  the supermarket lines  the bank lines  the emergency room lines  the question before us as a nation is whether we will forge ahead with that sense of resilience and purpose that has always marked america  will we address the mortgage crisis so more families don't lose their homes  will we finally achieve health care so that every single american has quality  affordable health care  will we get serious about reducing our dependence on foreign oil  will we tackle the gas prices that are going up astronomically  will we stop shipping american jobs overseas  will we adopt green energy policies including clean coal that will make economic sense and protect us  and our children's children  will we make college affordable again for the young people who are now being shut out of going to college  will we end no child left behind  which is not working  will we bring our troops home from iraq and end this war that has cost thousands of lives and billions of dollars  will we take care of those who have taken care of us   our veterans  west virginia has the highest proportion of veterans anywhere in our country  i am running for president because i believe we can answer all of those questions  i know we can achieve solutions to fix our economy and create new jobs and safeguard people's homes from foreclosure  relieve the burden of soaring food and gas prices  i believe we can bring our troops home with honor  following a strategy that is smart and safe starting within   days of my becoming president  i believe we can once again see good jobs with rising incomes  to do more to support children and families  especially in places like west virginia  and for just a moment  i'd like to mention your wonderful senior senator  senator robert c  byrd  many of you know that senator byrd lost his mother when he was only   year old  he grew up in poverty  but was fortunate to be taken in by an aunt and uncle who gave him the love and foundation of family  every year around mother's day  senator byrd gives a speech on the senate floor in appreciation of mothers  when i came to the senate  and my mother spent a lot of time with us  she now lives with us  she used to watch c'span all the time to see if she could catch a glimpse of me   to be very honest about it  and she fell in love with senator byrd  and a few years ago i took her to have lunch with senator byrd in his office and she told him how much she appreciated his mother's day speeches  in   he said something so cogent that i just want to repeat it here   that the best mothers invest the best of themselves in their families   they are high'stake brokers  and we  their families  are the stocks on their exchange  if we simply try our best  she will consider the return on her investment to be well met  one of the poems he read that year was  like mother  like son  although he barely had a chance to know his mother  to this day he still feels her gentle presence  her soft urging to do his best to make her proud  bill and i often talk about the challenges he faced in his family   when after his father died before he was born  his mother had to leave him to go to school to become a nurse  he was left with her parents while she was away  and there is such a poignant picture of him being taken to go visit his mother who was in nursing school in new orleans  and he is about   years old and he is all dressed up in a little suit that his grandmother had bought for him for the trip  and i remember his mother  virginia  telling me that she was so happy to see him but it was so heartbreaking when he left on the train going back to arkansas  one of bill's earliest memories is seeing his mother drop to her knees and just sobbing as her son left  but she was there to get a better education so she could take better care of him  i know bill  like senator byrd and millions of sons across america  as well as daughters from coast to coast  carry their mother's love with them everyday  i think there is more we can do to make sure that young parents are not so stressed out  it is hard raising children today  there are so many demands   the jobs don't pay what they used to  which means that usually you have to have both parents working  don't you  if you are a single mom  honestly  i think you are a miracle worker to be able to manage the family and a job at the same time  i think we should do more to help young families  i would like to see us experiment in our country with what other countries have  and that is not only expanding the family and medical leave act  so that we protect more families in times of emergency  i am very proud that millions and millions of people have taken advantage of that  the first bill that my husband signed  but we need to expand it because right now it cuts off at   employees   we need to bring that down to   employees because when you have a newborn baby  or you adopt a baby  or your spouse or yourself is sick  or your parent is sick  it is terrible having to make a choice between losing your job and taking care of your loved one  i just worked to pass legislation which we have passed to extend the family and medical leave to the families of wounded soldiers  because so many of them  when they are brought back to the country they need extensive and lengthily care  and they need their families by their side  so we're going to make sure we protect their jobs and i'd like that to be available for more people  here in west virginia  that would help a lot of west virginians  i also want to push for something that is not available in very many places today  that is some form of paid leave for limited purposes  because what happens now with unpaid leave is that if you can't afford to go from your job  you can't take it even if it is available to you  if we had a small limited program of paid leave that the federal government would work with the states to provide    workers in west virginia in the private sector might be eligible  i also think it is important we look at the end of life and the beginning of life together  we need more child'care for families  we have   children under six in west virginia that don't have good child'care  but we also have many  many families taking care of loved ones and they don't get much help doing it  the average family in america taking care of a child with a disability  a spouse with alzheimer's  a parent with parkinson's  will spend at least   out of pocket taking care of that loved one  i think we should give a   caregiver tax credit so that families are not put at a financial disadvantage for doing what they are doing out of love and dedication  i also would like to see us make it easier and less expensive to buy long'term care policies  it's one of the biggest concerns families have what happens if my parent or my grandparent or my spouse is no longer able to take care of him or herself and i physically can't do it any longer and don't have any help to do it  how can we get some long'term care in the home or in some other setting  and i think we should have a long'term care tax credit  as well  so people can buy long'term care insurance  on all of these issues  it really does matter whether we are going to care for one another  and i think it is interesting that this holiday we start today was the idea of a woman  right here in grafton  anna jarvis prevailed against the odds  if you were to come with an idea right now for a national holiday and you persevered for nine or ten years like she did  it would be a labor of love  and that is what it sometimes does take to make the changes that are going to benefit us  i want to just end by spotlighting another mother  because this whole question of equal pay for equal work really is at the core of my belief that we have got to get to equality in the workplace  lily ledbetter was a mother who raised her two children while working at a tire factory in alabama  for almost two decades  before she learned she was being paid far less than her male counterparts doing the same job  she sued under the equal pay act  which has been in existence for   years  the supreme court  controlled by the new bush chief justice threw her case out  they said she didn't file the complaint soon enough  the only problem was she hadn't known until after all those years she wasn't being paid the same  you don't go up to your fellow employees and say show me your pay stub  you just don't do that  the information was a secret  so we tried to fix that loophole in the senate a few weeks ago but the republicans blocked us  i want people to remember that in this upcoming election season  because when women in workplaces are discriminated against  paid lower wages than they deserve  that affects their husbands  it affects their children  it affects the family income  when women make   on a dollar for a man and a mom goes to the grocery store  the checkout counter person doesn't say  you only make   so we are going to cut the cost of the groceries by   that doesn't happen  so we have got to remedy that  and there is a lot of other unfinished business  but it is exciting to know that we are here on the hundredth anniversary of this celebration  and in two days  the voters of west virginia will join the tens of millions of americans who have already cast their vote for president  i am asking for your support so that i can continue to fight for you and fight to finish the work that we have started  i would not be standing here if it were not for all the women who went before  not only the women in my own life  like my mother and my grandmother  or my wonderful daughter whom i am so thrilled to have with me here today  but it is also because of countless women and men whose names we may never know who really believed strongly in what they thought would make their community and their country better places  so i leave you today with a mother's day message i received a few days ago from a   year old young women in kentucky   happy mother's day  she wrote   hopefully i will be wishing you one next year as president  you have already succeeded as the world's hardest job  being a mother  the second hardest job should be a breeze for you  happy mother's day everybody "], ["clinton", "thank you  west virginia  you know  like the song says   it's almost heaven  and i am so grateful for this overwhelming vote of confidence  there are some who have wanted to cut this race short  they say  give up  it's too hard  the mountain is too high  but here in west virginia  you know a thing or two about rough roads to the top of the mountain  we know from the bible that faith can move mountains and  my friends  the faith of the mountain state has moved me  i am more determined than ever to carry on this campaign until everyone has had a chance to make their voices heard  i want to commend senator obama and his supporters  this continues to be a hard fought race  from one end of our country to the other  and yes  we've had a few dust ups along the way  but our commitment to bring america new leadership that will renew america's promise means that we have always stood together on what is most important  now  tonight i need your help to continue this journey  we are in the homestretch  there are only three weeks left in the final contests  and your support can make the difference between winning and losing  so i hope you'll go to hillaryclinton com and support our campaign  you've heard this before   there are many who wanted to declare a nominee before the ballots were counted or even cast  some said our campaign was over after iowa  but then we won new hampshire  then we had big victories on super tuesday and in ohio and texas and pennsylvania  and of course  we came from behind to win in indiana  so  this race isn't over yet  neither of us has the total delegates it takes to win and both senator obama and i believe that the delegates from florida and michigan should be seated  i believe we should honor the votes cast by   million people in those states and seat all of their delegates  under the rules of our party  when you include all   states  the number of delegates needed to win is   and neither of us has reached that threshold yet  this win in west virginia will help me move even closer  now  in a campaign  it can be easy to get lost in the political spin and the polls or the punditry  but we must never lose sight of what really counts  of why all of us care so much about who wins and who loses in our political system  an enormous decision falls on the shoulders of democratic voters in these final contests and those democrats empowered to vote at our convention  and tonight  in light of our overwhelming victory here in west virginia  i want to send a message to everyone still making up their mind  i am in this race because i believe i am the strongest candidate   the strongest candidate to lead our party in november of   and the strongest president to lead our nation starting in january of   i can win this nomination if you decide i should  and i can lead this party to victory in the general election if you lead me to victory now  the choice falls to all of you  and i don't envy you  i deeply admire senator obama  but i believe our case  a case west virginia has helped to make  our case is stronger  together  we have won millions and millions of votes   by the time tonight is over  probably   million  close to it  we've won them in states that we must be prepared and ready to win in november   pennsylvania and ohio  arkansas and new hampshire  new jersey  new mexico  nevada  michigan  florida  and now west virginia  it is a fact that no democrat has won the white house since   without winning west virginia  the bottom line is this   the white house is one in the swing states and i am winning the swing states  and we have done it by standing up for the deepest principles of our party with a vision for an america that rewards hard work again  that values the middle class and helps to make it stronger  with your help  i am ready to go head to head with john mccain to put our vision for america up against the one he shares with president bush  now  i believe our party is strong enough for this challenge  i am strong enough for it  you know i never give up  i'll keep coming back  and i'll stand with you as long as you stand with me  together  we will draw the stark distinctions that will determine the future direction of our nation  the difference between ending the war in iraq responsibly or continuing it indefinitely  between health care for everyone and more uninsured americans  between standing up for the middle class families that you represent or standing up for the corporate special interests  so  i ask you  democrats  to choose who you believe will make the strongest candidate in the fall and who is ready to execute the office of the presidency of the united states  people ask me all the time  why am i in this race  well  i'm in it because of the people that i have worked for my entire life and the people i meet along the campaign trail  people who need someone who fights for them because they're fighting so hard every single day  the people who drive for miles to show their support  who come with the home made sign  who raise money by skipping those dinners out  who have stood fast and stood strong  i'm in this race for the millions of americans who know that we can do better in our country  for the nurse on her second shift  for the worker on the line  for the waitress on her feet  for the small business owner  the farmer  the teacher  the coal miner  the trucker  the soldier  the veteran  the college student  all of the hardworking men and women who defy the odds to build a better life for themselves and their children  you will never be counted out  and i won't either  you will never quit  and i won't  either  the question is  why do so many people keep voting  why did   of democrats say in a recent poll they wanted this race to continue  because in the face of the pundits and the naysayers  they know what is at stake  they know that we have two wars  an economy in crisis on the brink of a recession    trillion of debt  oil prices shooting through the roof  gas prices and grocery prices hurting people who desperately are looking for a way to just keep going day to day  they know they need a champion  they need someone who's going to never stop fighting for health care that covers everyone  no exceptions  for an economy that lifts everyone up  for good jobs that won't be shipped overseas  for college affordability  for all that you can do to own a home and then to keep it  this election is fundamentally about whether or not the american dream remains alive and well  for our children and our grandchildren  this is the core of my life and my political beliefs  that we owe so much to future generations  that we do not want to see that dream recede  that we know people have to work hard  and we expect you to do just that and to take responsibility  but at the very least  you should have a president who is on your side again  and i believe that this campaign has been good for the democratic party and good for our country  people are discussing and debating issues  they are turning out in record numbers to register and to vote  there is an excitement about politics that is the lifeblood of our democracy  for me  this election isn't about who's in or who's out or who's up or who's down  it's about the common threads that tie us together   rich and poor  young and old  black and white  latino and asian  democrats  republicans  and independents  we are united by common values  we all want a better world for our children  and we want the best for our country  and we are committed to putting a democrat back in the white house  and our nominee   our nominee will be stronger for having campaigned long and hard  building enthusiasm and excitement  hearing your stories and answering your questions  and i will work my heart out for the nominee of the democratic party to make sure we have a democratic president  as we look at the stakes in this election  i think we can all agree it's been unprecedented  we haven't had an election like it for as long as anyone can remember  it is still so close and it really does depend upon those who will vote in these next contests and those who have the awesome responsibility as delegates of our great democratic party  i'm asking that people think hard about where we are in this election  about how we will win in november  because this is not an abstract exercise  this is for a solemn  crucial purpose  to elect a president to turn our country around  to meet the challenges we face and seize the opportunities  it has been a long campaign  but it is just an instant in time when compared with the lasting consequences of the choice we will make in november  that is why i am carrying on  and if you give me a chance  democrats  i'll come back to west virginia in the general election and we'll win this state and we'll win the white house  i am honored and grateful for the support and hospitality of the people of west virginia  i spent a few minutes with your wonderful national treasure  senator byrd  this morning and we talked about his beloved west virginia  i told him where i'd gone and what i'd seen  i talked about the people i had met  and he just broke into the biggest smile  i don't know that any man has ever loved a state more than robert c  byrd loves west virginia  i am grateful for the graciousness of governor and mrs  manchin  governor manchin is winning a great victory himself tonight  and i want to thank joe and gayle for welcoming me to governor manchin's hometown as we went to fairmont for a great election last night  i want to thank senate majority leader truman chafin  former governor hulett smith  brigadier general jack yeager  all of the west virginia veterans who honored me by their support and i honor their service  thanks to my friends in the labor unions who stood with us every step of the way  we wouldn't be here without you  and a special thanks to my outstanding staff  volunteers and supporters here in west virginia and across america  at least once  usually a half a dozen times a day  bill and chelsea and i check in with each other and i wish every west virginian could have heard our calls as we compared our experiences here in this state  we've had the best time  and i will be back  as we move on now to the next contests  in kentucky and oregon  in puerto rico  in montana and south dakota  tonight i'm thinking about florence steen from south dakota  eighty eight years old and in failing health when she asked that her daughter bring an absentee ballot to her hospice bedside  florence was born before women had the right to vote  and she was determined to exercise that right  to cast a ballot for her candidate who just happened to be a woman running for president  florence passed on a few days ago  but i am eternally grateful to her and her family for making this such an important and incredible milestone in her life that means so much to me  i'm also thinking of dalton hatfield  an  year old boy from kentucky  who sold his bike and sold his video games to raise money to support my campaign  this is a great and good nation because of people like florence steen  dalton hatfield  and their families  her memory and his future are worth fighting for  as long as we remember that there is no challenge we cannot meet  no barrier we cannot break  no dream we cannot realize  so  let's finish the job we started  america is worth fighting for  thank you and god bless you and god bless america  thank you all so very much "], ["clinton", "thank you  kentucky  thank you all very  very much  i am so grateful for this victory  and i am so appreciative  because tonight i am thinking about why we are all here  it is not just to win a primary  or even just to win an election  what propels us is the struggle to realize america's promise  a nation where every child can achieve his or her god given potential  where every man and woman has a fair chance  where we fulfill the ideals our founders pledged their lives to defend and our nation was born to uphold  i want to say a special word this evening about someone who has spent his whole life dedicated to realizing the promise of america  senator ted kennedy is one of the greatest progressive leaders in our party's history  and one of the most effective senators in our country's history  he's my friend  and he's my inspiration  more than that  he is a hero to millions of americans whose lives he has fought to better  i am proud to have stood side by side with ted kennedy to increase the minimum wage  to extend health insurance to millions of children  to help stop insurance companies from discriminating against the sick  but the privileges that i have had and so many others have had because of the battles we have fought side by side with him are just a mere handful of what he has done during his entire public service  five extraordinary decades devoted to america  and as a lifelong champion for social justice and equality  his work has made the path easier for me  for senator obama  and for countless others  he has been with us for our fights and we're with him now in his  and i know he is going to fight with all of his legendary might  supported by his wonderful wife vicki and his entire family against this latest challenge  and we wish him well and send our thoughts and prayers to him  tonight we've achieved an important victory  it is not just kentucky bluegrass that is music to my ears  it is the sound of your overwhelming vote of confidence even in the face of some pretty tough odds  some have said your votes didn't matter  that this campaign was over  that allowing everyone to vote and every vote to count would somehow be a mistake  but that didn't stop you  you've never given up on me because you know i'll never give up on you  this is one of the closest races for a party's nomination in modern history  we're winning the popular vote and i'm more determined than ever to see that every vote is cast and every ballot counted  i commend senator obama and his supporters and while we continue to go toe to toe for this nomination  we do see eye to eye when it comes to uniting our party to elect a democratic president in the fall  but i need your help  your support has made the difference between victory and defeat  though we have been outspent massively  your support has helped us make our case on the air and on the ground  and your help will keep us going  we've made it this far together  so please go to hillaryclinton com and together we will make history  and i can't do it without you  now  you know that the stakes are high  after all this country has been through the past seven years  we have to get this right  we have to select a nominee who is best positioned to win in november  and someone who is best prepared to address the enormous challenges facing our country in these difficult times  that is what this election is all about  now  i'm told that more people have voted for me than for anyone who has ever run for the democratic nomination  that is more than   million votes  now  why  why do millions keep turning out to vote in the face of naysayers and skeptics  because you know that our political process is more than candidates running  or the pundits chattering  or the ads blaring  it is about the path we choose as a nation and whether or not we will solve our toughest problems  whether or not we will have a president who will rebuild the economy  end the war in iraq  restore our leadership in the world and stand up for you every single day  the people i meet along the campaign trail don't always make the headlines  the nurses and teachers  the truckers and soldiers  the waitresses and firefighters  the police officers and coal miners  the college students and line workers  the men and women who get up every single day  work hard to make a difference for their families  the people struggling to make ends meet  to find a good job  to pay the bills  to have a shot at the american dream  for too long  too many americans have felt invisible in their own country  well  you've never been invisible to me  i've been fighting for you my entire life  and i want you to remember  we are in this race because we believe that every single american deserves quality  affordable health care  no exceptions  we are in this race because we believe everyone deserves a shot at the american dream  the opportunity to work hard at a good job to get ahead  to save for college  for a home  for retirement  to fill the gas tank and buy the groceries with a little left at the end of each month  to build a better life for you and your children  we are in this race because we believe this new century poses new challenges to meet and new opportunities to seize  if we only had a president ready  willing and able to lead  to turn the climate crisis into an energy revolution and create million of new jobs  to turn the risks of the new global economy into the rewards of new prosperity shared by all of our people  we are in this race because we believe it will take a commander in chief with the strength and knowledge to end the war in iraq safely and quickly  and a president with experience representing the people of the united states in more than   countries to restore our leadership and moral authority in the world  and yes  we are in this race because we believe america is worth fighting for  this continues to be a tough fight  and i have fought it the only way i know how   with determination  by never giving up and never giving in  i have done it  not because i wanted to demonstrate my toughness  but because i believe passionately that for the sake of our country the democrats must take back the white house and end the republican rule  this country needs our combination of strength and compassion to help people struggling with their bills  living the hard reality of everyday life  in need of our leadership on issues from health care to energy to social security  that's why i'm still running and that's why you're still voting  and i'm going on now to campaign in montana  south dakota  and puerto rico  and i'm going to keep standing up for the voters of florida and michigan  democrats in those two states cast   million votes and they deserve to have those votes counted  that's why i'm going to keep making our case until we have a nominee  whoever she may be  it is especially sweet tonight because kentucky has a knack for picking presidents  this state delivered two terms to a president named clinton  and it's often been said  as kentucky goes  so goes the nation  neither senator obama nor i have won the   delegates required to secure the nomination  and because this race is so close  still separated by less than   delegates out of more than   neither senator obama nor i will have reached that magic number when the voting ends on june the  rd  so  our party will have a tough choice to make  who is ready to lead our party at the top of our ticket  who is ready to defeat senator mccain in the swing states and among swing voters  who is ready to rebuild the economy and the war in iraq and protect our national security as commander in chief  who is ready on day one to lead  there are so many kentuckians that i want to thank  i am so honored by your support and hospitality to me  to bill and to chelsea  and i want to thank jerry and charlotte lundergan and my entire kentucky steering committee  including former governors wendell ford  julian carroll  john y  brown  martha layne collins and paul patent  i want to thank speaker jody richards and his wife neva  former attorney general  greg stumbo  majority leader rocky adkins and tina ward pugh  and terry mcbrayer  joetta wickliffe and loretta bosley  i want to thank my friends in labor for standing by us every step of the way  i am grateful to the kentucky veterans for hillary and honored by your support and your service  i want to thank my chairman  terry mcauliffe  and my family  i am so grateful to the outstanding staff  volunteers and supporters in kentucky and in oregon and across america who have worked so hard  now  i have one more request to all of my supporters tonight  to the people i've met along the campaign trail  to everyone who has knocked on doors and volunteered and put up signs and donated to this campaign  keep working  keep fighting  keep standing up for what you believe is right  because that is exactly what i'm going to do  people ask me all the time  how do you keep going  well  it is you who keep me going  and tonight  i'm thinking about all of the women i've met who were born before women could vote  just this week  i met  year old emma hollis  an african american woman  she has seen so many barriers crumble and fall in her lifetime  but she is not finished yet  she has been volunteering out of our campaign office in covington to help our campaign break the highest and hardest glass ceiling in the land  i'm thinking about andrea steagall  a strong and composed young woman    years old  who drove across kentucky to meet me  her husband  justin  is deployed in afghanistan  and she told me how important it is that we have a president who will always stand up for our veterans  and i am honored by her support  and by her family's service and sacrifice  and i'm thinking again about dalton hatfield  the  year old from kentucky  who sold his bike and his video games to raise money to support my campaign  and then he asked others to give  too  and he was able to really give me a boost  and this week  i finally had the chance to meet him in prestonsburg and to say  dalton  thank you so much  the   you raised helped carry the day in kentucky  that's why i'm in this race  to fight for your future  and that's why whatever happens  i'll work as hard as i can to elect a democratic president this fall  the state motto of kentucky is   united we stand  divided we fall  words that have a special place in our history  they inspired american revolutionaries to unite the colonies  to defy an empire and create a new nation  to invent a new form of government  of the people  by the people  for the people  and they have bound our nation together in service and sacrifice  even in our darkest hours  we will come together as a party  united by common values and common cause  united in service of the hopes and dreams that know no boundaries of race or creed  gender or geography  and when we do  there will be no stopping us  we won't just unite our party  we will unite our country and make sure america's best years are still ahead of us  thank you  and god bless you and god bless america "], ["clinton", "it's exciting to be with some wonderful supporters and friends  i thank your senator and my friend  ted deutch  he's a real leader  he and i have talked about the issues that matter to you over many years  and i'm so grateful to have his support  commissioner burt aaronson  who has also led the way in so many important things here in palm beach county  i want to thank jean enright  one of your port commissioners  i want to thank anne gannon  the tax collector who is here  representative kelly skidmore  and i am especially pleased to be accompanied today by a longtime friend of mine  congresswoman corrine brown  who is a real fighter and a champion  she has a tremendously important position in the house of representatives  where she does work on behalf of veterans and the needs  not only of her constituents in the jacksonville area  but indeed all of florida and america  now  this year's presidential election is like none other in history  and we have had more people engaging and volunteering  casting their ballots  than ever before  everywhere i go  people tell me   i've never given money to a campaign in my life  this year is different  i've never followed an election before  this time i can't stop watching  and there's a reason for that  with our economy in crisis  and with two wars and our children's future in the balance  more people than ever before are taking politics seriously  i happen to welcome that because this is a democracy  and we've all got to participate  in fact  we want more democracy  not less democracy  we want more people taking a part in the selection of their president  here in florida  more than   million people cast their vote  the highest primary turnout in the history of florida  and nearly   voters in michigan did the same  and not a day goes by that i don't meet someone who grabs my hand or holds up a sign  no matter where i am  in kentucky or anywhere else  and says   please  make my vote count  i receive dozens and dozens of letters and emails and phone calls  every couple of hours it seems like  all making the same urgent request  please count my vote  we used to be worried about voter apathy  didn't we  we worried why americans didn't participate  now  people are worried that their participation won't matter  i believe the democratic party must count these votes  they should count them exactly as they were cast  democracy demands no less  i am here today because i believe that the decision our party faces is not just about the fate of these votes and the outcome of these primaries  it is about whether we will uphold our most fundamental values as democrats and americans  it is about whether we will move forward  united  to win this state and take back the white house this november  that has to be the prize that we keep in mind  because here in america  unlike in many other nations  we are bound together  not by a single shared religion or cultural heritage  but by a shared set of ideas and ideals  a shared civic faith  that we are entitled to speak and worship freely  that we deserve equal justice under the law  that we have certain core rights that no government can abridge and these rights are rooted in and sustained by the principle that our founders set forth in the declaration of independence  that a just government derives its power from the consent of the governed  that each of us should have an equal voice in determining the destiny of our nation  a generation of patriots risked and sacrificed lives on the battlefield for that ideal  the union they ultimately formed was far from perfect  it excluded many of our citizens  people like congresswoman brown  me  my daughter  but it was an ideal that set forth a goal that we have consistently worked for  fortunately  in each successive generation  this nation was blessed by men and women who refused to accept their assigned place as second class citizens  men and women who saw america not as it was  but as it could and should be  and committed themselves to extending the frontiers of our democracy  the abolitionists and all who fought to end slavery and ensure freedom came with the full right of citizenship  the tenacious women and a few brave men who gathered at the seneca falls convention back in   to demand the right to vote  it took more than   years of struggle  setbacks  and grinding hard work and only one of those original suffragists lived to see women cast their ballots  there are women here today   as with my own mother   who were born before the constitution granted us the right to vote  this is not something lost in the mists of memory and history  this is real  the generations here in this room have seen change  the men and women who knew their constitutional right to vote meant little when poll taxes and literacy tests  violence  and intimidation made it impossible to exercise their right  so they marched and protested  faced dogs and tear gas  knelt down on that bridge in selma to pray and were beaten within an inch of their lives  some gave their lives to the struggle for a more perfect union  there is a reason why so many have fought so hard and sacrificed so much  it is because they knew that to be a citizen of this country is to have the right and responsibility to help shape its future  not just to make your voice heard  but to have it count  people have fought hard because they knew their vote was at stake and so was their children's future  because of those who have come before  senator obama and i and so many of you have this precious right today  because of all that has been done  we are in this historic presidential election  i believe that both senator obama and myself have an obligation as potential democratic nominees   in fact  we all have an obligation as democrats   to carry on this legacy and ensure that in our nominating process every voice is heard and every single vote is counted  this work to extend the franchise to all of our citizens is a core mission of the modern democratic party  from signing the voting rights act and fighting racial discrimination at the ballot box  to lowering the voting age so those old enough to fight and die in war would have the right to choose their commander in chief  to fighting for multi lingual ballots so you can make your voice heard no matter what language you speak  i am proud of our work today  we are fighting the redistricting initiatives that would dilute african american and latino votes  we are fighting efforts to purge voters from the rolls here in florida and elsewhere  we are fighting voter identification laws that could wrongly keep tens of thousands of voters from casting their ballots this november  we carry on this cause for a simple reason  because we believe the outcome of our elections should be determined by the will of the people   nothing more  nothing less  we believe the popular vote is the truest expression of your will  we believe it today  just as we believed it back in   when right here in florida  you learned the hard way what happens when your votes aren't counted and the candidate with fewer votes is declared the winner  the lesson of   here in florida is crystal clear  if any votes aren't counted  the will of the people is not realized and our democracy is diminished  that is what i have always believed  my first job in politics was on the   presidential campaign registering african american and hispanic voters in texas  that work took me from home to home in neighborhood after neighborhood  i was determined to knock on every door and sign up every voter i could find  while we may not have won that election  i have never given up the fight  it is a fight i continue to this day  because i think it is appalling that in the  st century  voters are still being wrongly turned away from the polls  ballots are still mysteriously lost in state after state  african american and hispanic voters still wait in line for hours while voters in the same state  even in the same county can wait just minutes to cast their votes  that's why i've been working since   with my dear friend congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones to pass the count every vote act  comprehensive voting rights legislation designed to end these deplorable violations  it will ensure that every eligible voter can vote  every vote is counted  and every vote can verify his or her vote before it is finally cast  i will continue to fight for that same principle every day in this campaign  the fact is  the people of florida voted back in january  you did your part  you showed up in record numbers and you made informed choices  but today  some months later  you still do not know if these votes will help determine our party's nominee  you still don't know if this great state will be represented at our convention in august  it is time you knew  because the more than   million people who voted in florida and michigan exercised their fundamental american right in good faith  you watched the news  you went to the candidates' web sites  you talked to your friends and neighbors  you learned about our records and policies so you could make informed voting decisions  you didn't break a single rule  and you should not be punished for matters beyond your control  now  i know that senator obama chose to remove his name from the ballot in michigan  and that was his right  but his choice does not negate the votes of all those who turned out to cast their ballots  and we should not let our process rob them and all of you of your voices  to do so would undermine the very purpose of the nominating process  to ensure that as many democrats as possible can cast their votes  to ensure that the party selects a nominee who truly represents the will of the voters and to ensure that the democrats take back the white house to rebuild america  now  i've heard some say that counting florida and michigan would be changing the rules  i say that not counting florida and michigan is changing a central governing rule of this country   that whenever we can understand the clear intent of the voters  their votes should be counted  i remember very well back in   there were those who argued that people's votes should be discounted over technicalities  for the people of florida who voted in this primary  the notion of discounting their votes sounds way too much of the same  the votes of   million people should not be cast aside because of a technicality  the people who voted did nothing wrong  and it would be wrong to punish you  as the florida supreme court said back in   before the united states supreme court took the case away from them  as your supreme court said  it's not about the technicalities or about the contestants  it's about the will of the people  and whenever you can understand their intent  it should govern  it's very clear what   million people intended here in florida  playing a role in the nominating process in a two party system is just as important as having a vote in the presidential election on election day count  we know it was wrong to penalize voters for the decisions of state officials back in the   presidential election  it would be wrong to do so for decisions made in our nominating process  democrats argued passionately  we are still arguing  aren't we  for counting all the votes back in   and we should be just as passionately arguing for that principle today  here in florida and in michigan  it is well within the democratic party rules to take this stand  the rules clearly state that we can count all of these votes and seat all of these delegates  pledged and unpledged  if we so choose  and the rules lay out a clear process for doing so  with this process  if hope we will honor the will of those who came out to cast votes  think of how that day was  workers who rushed to the polls between shifts  students who came between classes  parents who rearranged their family's schedules  senior citizens who arranged transportation to the polls  all so you could have your votes counted  and whether you voted for better schools for your kids or a secure retirement for your parents  for jobs you can raise a family on  for health care you can afford  to bring your son  your grandson  your daughter or your granddaughter back from iraq or bring back america's reputation in the world  whether you voted for me or senator obama or senator edwards or someone else  each vote you cast is a prayer for our nation  a declaration of your dreams for your children and grandchildren  a reflection of your determination to ensure that our country lives up to its promise  each vote is a tool  one used throughout history to break barriers  open doors  and widen the circle of opportunity  i remember when president lyndon johnson addressed the congress and the nation urging the passage of the voting rights act  he declared   i speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy  it was urgent  elevated language  but it was not hyperbole  now  as back then  those are the stakes  that's why here in florida  even when you were told your primary might not count  you voted anyway  a floridian i know from tallahassee told me about his mother's canasta club  it's a group of women in their golden years who gather every week to play cards and visit  they talked about that florida primary every week as they gathered around the card table  they followed the news closely  they discussed the candidates and their positions on the issues  they knew about the dispute over the primary schedule and the question of seating delegates  and when it came time to vote  like so many other good citizens of this state  the ladies of the canasta club dutifully cast their ballots for the candidates of their choice  they made informed choices  they did nothing wrong  and they should not be punished for doing their civic duty  you knew then what americans know  that this political process of ours is about more than the candidates running  the pundits commenting or the ads blaring  it's about the path we choose as a nation  if anyone ever doubted whether it mattered who our president was  the last seven years with george bush should have removed every single doubt from anyone's mind  that's why you voted  and that's why i'm running  and that's why you've been organizing and raising your voices  hoping to have your votes count  you refused to stay home then  and you refuse to stay silent now  because you want to change america's future and you have faith that your party  the democratic party  will give you that chance  i'm here today because i believe we should keep that faith  listen to your voices and count every single one of your votes  if we fail to do so  i worry that we will pay not only a moral cost  but a political cost as well  we know the road to a democratic white house runs right through florida and michigan  and if we care about winning those states in november  we need to count your votes now  if democrats send the message that we don't fully value your votes  we know senator mccain and the republicans will be more than happy to have them  the republicans will make a simple and compelling argument  why should florida and michigan voters trust the democratic party to look out for you when they won't even listen to you  now  if you agree with me  i urge you to go to my website  hillaryclinton com  and join the more than   who have already signed our petition asking the democratic national committee to count your votes  all   states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and the territories will have a chance to play a role in this historic process  now is not the time for our party to have a dialogue about which states and which votes should count  the people of florida are all too familiar with where that discussion can lead  in the end  we cannot move forward as a united party if some members of our party are left out  senator obama and i are running to be president of all americans and all   states  and i want to be sure that all   states are counted and your delegates are seated at our convention  so will you join me in making sure your voices are raised and heard so that your votes can be counted  because remember  it's been the mission of the democratic party  guided always by the understanding that as president franklin delano roosevelt once said   the ultimate rulers of our democracy are not the president  the senators  the members of congress and government officials  but the voters of this country  in this democratic party  the voters rule  so let's make sure your voices are heard and your votes are counted  thank you  and god bless you  and god bless america "], ["clinton", "thank you so much  i have four words for you  te quiero puerto rico  never before have these beautiful islands had such an important voice in a presidential election  and i have thoroughly enjoyed my time here  i cannot thank you all enough  bill and chelsea and i are so grateful to the bottom of our hearts for your generosity and your kindness  and i hope that we have helped to draw attention to the concerns of puerto rico and we have also helped to spotlight the beauty and the spirit of this wonderful place  i am grateful for this show of overwhelming support  i came to puerto rico to listen to your voices because your voices deserve to be heard  and i hear you  and i see you  and i will always stand up for you  i also want to recognize senator obama and his supporters  our two campaigns have turned out record numbers of new voters  determined to chart a new course for america  now  this primary election has been hard fought because there is so much at stake and we must elect a democratic president  i am i am overwhelmed by this vote today and i cannot complete this journey without your help  we have two contests left in south dakota and montana  and you can make the difference by visiting hillaryclinton com and helping us make sure we go strong  every contribution will help us make our case to the voters who are going to be heading to the polls  and i want you to know that this election is really about your future  you voted even though some tried to tell you that your votes wouldn't count  you voted for the person you believe will be the stronger nominee and the strongest president  and you are not alone  you are joining millions of people across the united states  more than   million  plus the votes that we've received today  people who don't always make the headlines  who don't always feel like your voices are being heard  i think about these people all the time  because that's who i care most about  the nurse on her second shift who still can't pay her credit card bills  the worker who can't afford the gas on the way to work  the waitress on her feet without health care  the small business owners saddled with rising energy bills  the college student who can't afford to continue college  the farmer  the teacher  the trucker  the soldier  the veteran  the people yearning for a president who will rebuild the economy and a commander in chief who will restore our leadership and moral authority in the world  i know that people face tough times  but what i've been impressed by is the resourcefulness and resilience that the people here and across the united states use to face whatever challenges they confront  because they believe they can keep working for a better tomorrow  the american dream may bend under the weight of challenges we failed to meet and presidents who have failed to lead  it may bend  but it will never break  because that's what keeps so many of us going  the thought of a better life tomorrow and a better future for our children  i believe that the people of the united states need a champion in the white house  someone who will be a president in their corner and on their side  i believe you are voting because you want a president who will stand up for universal health care  who will stand up for action to address the housing crisis  who will stand up for better jobs to protect social security  you want to cut through the speeches and the sound bites to real solutions  and so today you've come out strong  you have defied the skeptics  more people across the country have voted for our campaign  more people have voted for us than for any candidate in the history of presidential primaries  we are winning the popular vote  now  there can be no doubt  the people have spoken and you have chosen your candidate  and it's important where we have won  we are winning these votes in swing states and among the very swing voters that democrats must win to take back the white house and put this country back on the path to prosperity  together  we've won the battleground states of pennsylvania  ohio  arkansas  west virginia  new hampshire  new jersey  new mexico  nevada  and  yes  michigan and florida  and i hope by my second term  regardless of what the people of puerto rico decide about the status option you prefer  you too will be able to vote for the next president of the united states  so  when the voting concludes on tuesday  neither senator obama nor i will have the number of delegates to be the nominee  i will lead the popular vote  he will maintain a slight lead in the delegate count  the decision will fall on the shoulders of those leaders in our party empowered by the rules to vote at the democratic convention  i do not envy the decision you must make  but a decision has to be made  and in the final assessment  i ask you to consider these questions  which candidate best represents the will of the people who voted in this historic primary  which candidate is best able to lead to us victory in november  and which candidate is best able to lead our nation as our president in the face of unprecedented challenges at home and abroad  i am in this race because i believe i am that candidate  and i will be that president  we are winning the popular vote because we have stood for the core principle of our party  a party that believes in universal health care   no one left out  a party that believes hard working  middle class families deserve a fair shot at the american dream  a party that believes we must bring our troops home from iraq safely  responsibly  and honorably  a party that cherishes every child  values every family  and counts every single vote  we are winning against john mccain and beating him in the key states  we have what it takes to get the   electoral votes necessary to win the white house  and the majority of voters know who is ready on day one to serve as our president  a president who will bring strength  knowledge  and experience to the white house to solve our toughest problems  a

thank you all so much  thank you  and thanks so much to south dakota  you had the last word in this primary season  and it was worth the wait   applause  i want to start tonight by congratulating senator obama and his supporters on the extraordinary race that they have run  senator obama has inspired so many americans to care about politics and empowered so many more to get involved  and our party and our democracy is stronger and more vibrant as a result  so we are grateful   applause  and it has been an honor to contest these primaries with him  just as it is an honor to call him my friend  and  tonight  i would like all of us to take a moment to recognize him and his supporters for all they have accomplished   applause  now    months ago  you and i began a journey to make history and to remake america  and from the hills of new hampshire to the hollows of west virginia and kentucky  from the fields of california to the factories of ohio  from the alleghenies to the ozarks to the everglades  to right here in the great state of new york  we   applause  we saw millions of americans registering to vote for the first time  raising money for the first time  knocking on doors  making calls  talking to their friends and neighbors  mothers and fathers lifting their little girls and their little boys onto their shoulders and whispering   see  you can be anything you want to be  audience  hillary  hillary  hillary  hillary  hillary  hillary  hillary   applause  mrs  clinton  and i think  too  of all those  audience  hillary  hillary  hillary  mrs  clinton    all those wonderful women in their  s who came out to see me  because they were born before women could vote  and they wanted to be part of making history  and the people who drove for miles  who waved their handmade signs  who went to all the events that we held  who came to hillaryclinton com and showed the tangible support that they felt in their hearts  and i am just enormously grateful  because  in the millions of quiet moments  in thousands of places  you asked yourself a simple question  who will be the strongest candidate and the strongest   applause  who will be ready to take back the white house and take charge as commander in chief and lead our country to better tomorrows  people in all   states  the district of columbia  puerto rico  and the territories  all had a chance to make your voices heard  and on election day after election day  you came out in record numbers to cast your ballots  nearly   million of you cast your votes   applause    for our campaign  carrying the popular vote with more votes than any primary candidate in history   applause  even when the pundits and the naysayers proclaimed week after week that this race was over  you kept on voting  you're the nurse on the second shift  the worker on the line  the waitress on her feet  the small business owner  the farmer  the teacher  the miner  the trucker  the soldier  the veteran  the student  the hard working men and women who don't always make the headlines  but have always written america's story  you have voted because you wanted to take back the white house  and because of you   applause    we won  together  the swing states necessary to get to   electoral votes   applause  and you know  audience  yes  she will  yes  she will  yes  she will  yes  she will  yes  she will  yes  she will  mrs  clinton  in all of the states  you voted because you wanted a leader who will stand up for the deepest values of our party  a party that believes everyone should have a fair shot at the american dream  a party that cherishes every child  values every family  and counts every single vote   applause  i often felt that each of your votes was a prayer for our nation  a declaration of your dreams for your children  a reflection of your desire to chart a new course in this new century  and  in the end  while this primary was long  i am so proud we stayed the course together   applause  because we stood our ground  it meant that every single united states citizen had a chance to make his or her voice heard  a record   million people voted in this primary   applause    from every state  red  blue  purple  people of every age  faith  color  and walk of life  and we have brought so many people into the democratic party and created enthusiasm among those we seek to serve  and i am committed to uniting our party so we move forward stronger and more ready than ever to take back the white house this november   applause  you know  for the past seven years  so many people in this country have felt invisible  like your president didn't even really see you  i have seen the shuttered factories  the jobs shipped overseas  the families struggling to afford gas and groceries  but i've also seen unions re training workers to build energy  efficient buildings  innovators designing cars that run on fuel cells and biofuels and electricity  cars that get more miles per gallon than ever before  cars that will cut the cost of driving  reduce our reliance on foreign oil  and fight global warming   applause  i have met too many people without health care  just a diagnosis away from financial ruin  but i've also seen the scientists and researchers solving the medical mysteries and finding the treatments and cures that are transforming lives  i've seen the struggling schools with the crumbling classrooms and the unfair burdens imposed by no child left behind  but i have also met dedicated and caring teachers who use their own savings to buy supplies and students passionately engaged in the issues of our time  from ending the genocide in darfur to once again making the environment a central issue of our day   applause  none of you  none of you is invisible to me  you never have been   applause  i see you  and i know how hard working you are  i've been fighting for you my whole adult life  and i will keep standing for you and working for you every single day  because in your courage and character  your energy and ingenuity  your compassion and faith  i see the promise of america every day  the challenges we face are great  but our determination is greater  you know  i understand that that a lot of people are asking   what does hillary want  what does she want  well  i want what i have always fought for in this whole campaign  i want to end the war in iraq   applause  i want to turn this economy around  i want health care for every american  i want every child to live up to his or her god given potential  and i want the nearly   million americans who voted for me to be respected  to be heard  and no longer to be invisible   applause  you see  i have an old fashioned notion  one that's been the basis of my candidacy and my life's work  that public service is about helping people solve their problems and live their own dreams  this nation has given me every opportunity  and that's what i want for every single american   applause  that's why i want universal health care  it is wrong   applause    that americans pay   percent more for health care than the people of any other wealthy nation  with costs doubling this decade  and nearly   million people without any health insurance at all  it is wrong for parents to have to choose between care for themselves or their children  to be stuck in dead end jobs just to keep their insurance  or to give up working altogether so their kids will qualify for medicaid  i've been working on this issue not just for the past   months  but for   years  and it is a fight   applause  it is a fight i will continue until every single american has health insurance  no exceptions and no excuses  i want an economy that works for all families  that's why i've been fighting to create millions of new jobs in clean energy and rebuilding our infrastructure  jobs to come to all of our states  and urban and rural areas  and suburban communities and small towns  and that's why i sounded the alarm on the home mortgage crisis well over a year ago   applause    because these are the issues that will determine whether we will once again grow together as a nation or continue to grow apart  and i want to restore america's leadership in the world  i want us to be led once again by the power of our values  to have a foreign policy that is both strong and smart  to join with our allies and confront our shared challenges  from poverty and genocide to global terrorism and global warming  these are the issues that brought me into this race  they are the lifeblood of my campaign  and they have been and will continue to be the causes of my life  and your spirit   applause    your spirit has inspired me every day in this race  while i traveled our country  talking about how i wanted to help you  time and again you reached out to help me  to grab my hand or grip my arm  to look into my eyes and tell me   don't quit  keep fighting  stay in this race   applause  now  there were days   applause    when i had the strength   there were the days when i had the strength enough to fight for all of us  and on the days that i didn't  i leaned on you  the soldier on his third tour of duty in iraq who told his wife  an iraqi veteran herself  to take his spending money and donate it to our campaign instead   applause    the  year old boy in kentucky  who sold his bike and video games to raise money for our campaign  the woman who came to a rally hours early  waited and waited to give me a rosary  and all those who whispered to me  simply to say   i am praying for you  so many people said this race was over five months ago in iowa  but we had faith in each other  and you brought me back in new hampshire  and on super tuesday  and in ohio  and in pennsylvania  and texas  and indiana  west virginia  kentucky  puerto rico  and south dakota   applause  i will carry your stories and your dreams with me every day for the rest of my life  now  the question is  where do we go from here  and given how far we've come and where we need to go as a party  it's a question i don't take lightly  this has been a long campaign  and i will be making no decisions tonight   applause  but this has always been your campaign  so  to the   million people who voted for me  and to our many other supporters out there of all ages  i want to hear from you  i hope you'll go to my web site at hillaryclinton com and share your thoughts with me and help in any way that you can  and in the coming days  i'll be consulting with supporters and party leaders to determine how to move forward with the best interests of our party and our country guiding my way  and i want   applause  i want to conclude tonight by saying   thank you  thank you to the people across america for welcoming me and my family into your homes and your hearts  thanks to all of you in every corner of this country who cast your votes for our campaign  i am honored and humbled by your support and your trust  thanks to my staff and volunteers for all those long hours and late nights   applause  and i thank your families and your loved ones  as well  because your sacrifice was theirs  and i especially want to thank all of the leadership of my campaign  our chairman  terry mcauliffe  and everyone who worked so hard   applause  and  of course  my family  for their incredible love  support  and work  bill and chelsea   applause    hugh and maria  tony and megan  zach and fiona  and my mother  who turns   tomorrow   applause  and  finally  i want to thank all of the people who had the courage to share your stories with me out on the campaign trail  tonight  i am thinking of a woman i met just yesterday in rapid city  south dakota  we were outside tally's restaurant  there was a crowd there as i was walking into the restaurant  and she was standing right up against the barrier  she grabbed my hand  and she said   what are you going to do to make sure i have health care  and as she was talking  she began to cry  she told me she works three jobs  she has suffered from seizures since childhood  she hasn't been able to afford insurance ever since she left her parents' home  it is shameful that anyone in this country could tell that story to me   applause  and whatever path i travel next  i promise i will keep faith with her and with everyone i met across this great and good country  you know  tonight  we stand just a few miles from the statue of liberty and from the site where the twin towers fell and where america rose again  lady liberty's presence and the towers' absence are a constant reminder that here in america we are resilient  we are courageous  we embrace all of our people  and that  when we face our challenges together  there is no barrier we can't overcome  no dream we can't realize  nothing we can't do if we just start acting like americans again  thank you all very much  god bless you  and god bless america "], ["clinton", "thank you all very  very much  thank you  it is wonderful being here with all of you  among so many friends and i feel like this is a giant family reunion  the largest aipac gathering in history and i feel like i am among family and thank you for the warm welcome  i want to thank my friend  lonny kaplan  for his leadership and that introduction  i also want to thank howard friedman for his leadership as president and to congratulate david victor on his election  i want to commend howard kohr  aipac's distinguished board of directors  and all of the aipac staff who work so hard every day all year round  and i particularly want to acknowledge the many students in the audience from around the country  the future of aipac and the u s israel relationship  i want to pay tribute to one member of the aipac family and my very good friend who is not with us this year  congressman tom lantos  tom bore witness to the worst of human cruelty and devoted his life to stopping it  he taught us to stand up for what's right  even when it's hard  especially when it's hard  and we will always cherish his memory and his wonderful family will always be in our hearts  and finally  i want to thank all of you for coming to washington  d c  once again to stand strong with israel and to strengthen that special bond between our countries  being here today  i am reminded of a passage in isaiah   upon your walls  o jerusalem  i have posted sentinels  all day and all night  they shall never be silent  just like the sentinels of old  you are never silent  you never grow weary and you never stop standing up for and fighting for israel  now  i know that there are some who say you shouldn't be here  who say speaking up for a strong  american israeli relationship is somehow at odds with america's interests  well  i believe that speaking up for a strong american israeli relationship is essential to our interests  and i reject that our common commitment to israel's survival and well being is not in the best interests of the united states of america  i think you not only have a right to stand up for what you believe in  you have a responsibility as americans to do so  you are acting in the highest american tradition  exercising a right enshrined in our constitution   the right to petition your government  and i applaud you for it  of course  i am privileged to represent one of the largest jewish constituencies in the world  is there anyone from new york even here in this audience today  i know you will be talking to your members of congress this week  but you won't need to ask me where i stand  because you already know the answer  i stand with you and for you  v the united states and israel have an incredible bond  as allies  friends  as partners  we have shared interests  we have shared ideals  these are not just common values  they are our core values  freedom  democracy  and human rights  women's rights  a robust civil society  and we stand with israel  because israel demonstrates that democracy can flourish in the most difficult conditions  because its very existence is a stinging rebuke to hatred and the holocaust  because in defeating terror israel's cause is our cause  and because israel's struggle is a struggle not just for the jewish people but for all people who want to live in peace and security under a democratically elected government  president harry truman certainly understood the importance of israel  he recognized the new nation just   minutes after david ben gurion read the proclamation of independence  so it is with joy and some sense of relief that we celebrate the  th anniversary of that day  and for all of the trials and tears  what a remarkable   years it has been  from my first trip to israel in   to my most recent  i have seen firsthand what israel has achieved   the desert is blooming again  and we can be so proud of the role that america has played in this success  every american president since truman recognized the special relationship and has made it stronger  israel is stronger because of us and because of you  but even as we celebrate these achievements  we know the work is far from over  israel is not yet safe  the values that israel represents are not yet secure  our hearts go out in particular to the courageous citizens of cities like sderot and ashkelon who live in fear that a rocket will fall on their homes or their children's schools at any moment  i have seen these security challenges firsthand  in   i went to the sbarro pizzeria with then president olmert just a few weeks after that tragic suicide bombing there  i visited with victims of terrorism in the hadassah hospital  i have been to gilo and seen the security fence protecting israeli families from attacks in their own homes  i have stood up and have spoken out for their right to have that protective fence  as a senator from new york  who has talked way too much  i have seen the tragic toll of terrorism on   here at home as well  my support for israel does not come recently or lightly  i know it is right in my head  in my heart and in my gut  and that is exactly the commitment we need in our next president   a democratic president  because the democratic party's strong commitment to the state of israel since the days of harry truman endures today  it is one of our party's most cherished values and it will continue under the next democratic president  i know senator obama understands what it is at stake here  it has been an honor to contest these primaries with him  it is an honor to call him my friend  and let me be very clear  i know that senator obama will be a good friend to israel  i know that senator obama shares my view that the next president must be ready to say to the world  america's position is unchanging  our resolve unyielding  our stance nonnegotiable  the united states stands with israel  now and forever  let me underscore that i believe we need a democrat in the white house next january because it is not just israel that faces challenges in the  st century  america does  too  the next president will inherit grave problems  difficult threats   a war in afghanistan and a war in iraq  america's reputation at an all time low  the continued threat of terrorism at home and abroad  president bush has moved us in the wrong direction  for all the strong rhetoric you heard from senator mccain on monday  he will continue the same failed policies in iraq and weaken our security  making the middle east a more dangerous place  america needs a new beginning in our foreign policy to make our country stronger and  frankly  to make our position in the world more credible  to give us the strategic leverage back that we have lost over the last seven years  we cannot stand strongly with israel if we are not strong at home and if we are not respected and considered strong and the leader of the world everywhere else  we have a rare moment of opportunity to change america's course and restore our standing in the world  we must seize this moment by leading our friends and allies in building the world we want rather than simply defending against a world we fear  we must build a world that will be safer  more prosperous  and more just  i believe security and opportunity go hand in hand  when children have hope  a real belief that there is opportunity ahead for them  we help to dry up the swamp of fear and pessimism that breeds terrorism  that means supporting education  not just for boys but for girls too  it also means that real economic opportunity can't grow where there is no security  and that opportunity alone is not enough to overcome extremism  i have been very specific about how i would make this new foreign policy vision that i share  and i think many of you do as well  a reality  today i want to lay out three principles that i hope will guide us in all that we do with israel and why it is important to put that relationship into the broader context of what foreign policy is in the best interests of the united states  first  i have a bedrock commitment to israel's security because israel's security is critical to our security  when islamic extremists  including the leaders of nations  proclaim death to america  death to israel  we understand that our two nations are fighting a shared threat  those of us in this room know this bond is so much more personal than any security agreement or risk assessment  we know a shared threat can also mean shared sorrow  when eight young men were killed in a jerusalem yeshiva in march including a  year old american named abraham david moses  we reunited in our grief  so  i strongly support israel's right to self defense  israel has both the right and the obligation to defend its citizens and i believe america should aid in that defense  i am proud to support the   billion in security assistance for israel and the foreign aid bill and i am committed in making sure that israel maintains a military edge to meet increasing threats  part of our commit israel's security is a commitment to the israeli palestinian peace process  i am deeply moved by the legacies of so many leaders who have sacrificed so much in the quest for peace  like my friend yitzhak rabin  and the warrior  ariel sharon  who is in our thoughts and prayers  we must support israel and in making the tough choices for peace  i believe that u s  diplomacy is critical to making progress and consistent u s  involvement can lower the level of violence and restore our credibility in the region  we need to talk to all sides but all parties must know we will always stand with israel in its struggle for peace and security  israel should know that the united states will never pressure her to make unilateral concessions or to impose a made in america solution  palestinians will need to do their part by renouncing violence and teaching their children the ways of peace and tolerance  we must show palestinians and moderate arabs that the path of reconciliation is better than the terrorist road to self destruction  i am deeply concerned about the growing threat in gaza  hamas has built a military force equipped with sophisticated weapons from iran  hamas' campaign of terror has claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent israelis  its charter calls for the destruction of israel  it has shown no commitment to peace or to renouncing violence  so  we must be clear about how we feel about our next president negotiating directly with hamas  here is how i feel  until hamas renouncing terrorism and recognizes israel  negotiating with hamas is unacceptable for the united states  we must continue to demand a return of the israeli soldiers captured by hamas and by hezbollah   ehud goldwasser  eldad regev  gilad shalit  i have been privileged to know karnit goldwasser  ehud's wife and i was proud to sponsor the resolution that passed the senate calling for their immediate release  i will not stop fighting and pressing for these soldiers to come home until they finally are safely home with the families that are waiting for them  the second principle is a simple one  no nuclear weapons for iran  iran is a country whose leaders  whose president denies the holocaust  he defies the international community  his government trains  funds  and arms hamas and hezbollah terrorists in attacking israeli civilians  he threatens to destroy israel  just this week  he said that israel is about to die and will soon be erased  we can never let iran obtain nuclear weapons  the next president will have to deal with the iranian challenge from day one  this is not just in israel's interests  it is in america's interests and the world's interests  and this is a threat that i take very seriously  i'm a co sponsor the iran nonproliferation act  i support calling the iranian revolutionary guard what it is  a terrorist organization  i have also said that should iran ever  ever contemplate using nuclear weapons against israel  they must understand what the consequences will be to them  but we must do everything in our power to prevent such an unthinkable day from ever happening and the best way to do that is to stop iran from getting nuclear weapons in the first place  we should start by developing an international consensus against iran's nuclear program with a set of tougher sanctions if iran continues to defy the international community  we should also work with israel and moderate arab neighbors to roll back iran's influence in that region  if the iranian government wants to become a responsible member of the international community  we would wholeheartedly welcome that change but iran simply cannot be allowed to continue its current behavior and i wish to underscore i believe that we are further behind in constraining iran today because of the failed policies of president bush than we would have been had we taken a much more aggressive engagement course earlier  that is why it is imperative that we get both tough and smart about dealing with iran before it is too late  now my third principle is standing up against hatred and anti semitism wherever it is found and it is not only israelis and jews who need to be speaking out against anti semitism  it is every fair thinking person who understands that it directly affects you as well  i have spoken out for years against anti semitism in palestinian schools  i am appalled  still today  the palestinian textbooks reject israel's right to exist and describe israel's founding as a catastrophe that's unprecedented in history  that is not education  it is indoctrination  we also know that the saudis have textbooks describing jews as wicked and we were all revolted when iran's president held a conference to deny the holocaust  but our vigilance against anti semitism must go beyond the middle east  it must receive no quarter anywhere in the world  the next president will face a test of resolve on this issue  at the   durban conference  also called the durban ii  i will never forget how the world's first conference against racism became a mockery of itself when it descended into anti semitism and hatred  the debacle at durban must never be repeated  we should take very strong action to ensure anti semitism is kept off the agenda at durban ii and if those efforts fail  i believe that the united states should boycott that conference  the challenge of fighting anti semitism is indeed great  but we know it is possible to change hearts and minds  we saw it recently when magen david adom was finally included in the international red cross after years of being singled out for being israeli  on one of my trips to israel  i met an mda member named natan  an ethiopian jew who had saved many innocent lives when he tackled a terrorist carrying explosives  it was a miracle that natan had survived  his valor was extraordinary and it was just what you would expect from a member of the mda  that's why i was so proud to take up the mda's cause  sponsoring legislation and speaking out  and i was very pleased as all of us were when the international red cross righted this historic wrong  on a personal level  i was honored when natan accepted my invitation to come to new york and walk with me in our salute to israel parade  in a way we are still walking together and the image of this very dignified ethiopian jew  now an israeli  walking in that parade down fifth avenue  bearing the scars of his heroic rescue effort to prevent the terrorists from destroying more lives  was one i will carry with me my entire life because that was really israel  it wasn't just everyone on the sides of the streets waving  it was this proud young man who had kept jewish traditions alive and as a long string of those for centuries who had done so and who had finally come home to israel and had given so much to protect the country that had given him a new life  so while it can be easy to be discouraged when we look at the challenges ahead  we can never lose our resolve and never give up hope  what gives me not just hope but the underlying reality that can be delivered by those who work together  is that the power of the values we share with israel are such an unshakable and unbreakable bond  and the difference that america can make is so critical  let me leave you with just in glimpse of why america matters and why aipac matters  in her memoir  one of my personal heroines  golda meir  wrote about the wonderful moment    years ago  when israel joined the family of nations and america stood at her side  here is what she wrote   a few minutes after midnight  my phone rang  it had been ringing all evening and as i ran to answer it  i wondered what bad news i would hear now  doesn't that sound familiar   but the voice at the other end of the phone sounded jubilant  'golda  are you listening  truman has recognized us ' i can remember what i said or did but i remember how i felt  it was like a miracle and i was filled with joy and relief  that was the decision that one american president made  to be there for israel at a time of need  that is the decision that the next president must be ready to make as well  to the members of aipac  just know your cause is just  your voice is strong  washington and the world is listening  so go forth and speak up for what you know is right  thank you  god bless you  god bless israel and god bless america  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", "thank you so much  thank you all  well  this isn't exactly the party i'd planned  but i sure like the company  i want to start today by saying how grateful i am to all of you   to everyone who poured your hearts and your hopes into this campaign  who drove for miles and lined the streets waving homemade signs  who scrimped and saved to raise money  who knocked on doors and made calls  who talked and sometimes argued with your friends and neighbors  who emailed and contributed online  who invested so much in our common enterprise  to the moms and dads who came to our events  who lifted their little girls and little boys on their shoulders and whispered in their ears   see  you can be anything you want to be  to the young people like   year old ann riddle from mayfield  ohio who had been saving for two years to go to disney world  and decided to use her savings instead to travel to pennsylvania with her mom and volunteer there as well  to the veterans and the childhood friends  to new yorkers and arkansans who traveled across the country and telling anyone who would listen why you supported me  to all those women in their  s and their  s born before women could vote who cast their votes for our campaign  i've told you before about florence steen of south dakota  who was   years old  and insisted that her daughter bring an absentee ballot to her hospice bedside  her daughter and a friend put an american flag behind her bed and helped her fill out the ballot  she passed away soon after  and under state law  her ballot didn't count  but her daughter later told a reporter   my dad's an ornery old cowboy  and he didn't like it when he heard mom's vote wouldn't be counted  i don't think he had voted in   years  but he voted in place of my mom  to all those who voted for me  and to whom i pledged my utmost  my commitment to you and to the progress we seek is unyielding  you have inspired and touched me with the stories of the joys and sorrows that make up the fabric of our lives and you have humbled me with your commitment to our country    million of you from all walks of life   women and men  young and old  latino and asian  african american and caucasian  rich  poor and middle class  gay and straight   you have stood strong with me  and i will continue to stand strong with you  every time  every place  and every way that i can  the dreams we share are worth fighting for  remember   we fought for the single mom with a young daughter  juggling work and school  who told me   i'm doing it all to better myself for her  we fought for the woman who grabbed my hand  and asked me   what are you going to do to make sure i have health care  and began to cry because even though she works three jobs  she can't afford insurance  we fought for the young man in the marine corps t shirt who waited months for medical care and said   take care of my buddies over there and then  will you please help take care of me  we fought for all those who've lost jobs and health care  who can't afford gas or groceries or college  who have felt invisible to their president these last seven years  i entered this race because i have an old fashioned conviction  that public service is about helping people solve their problems and live their dreams  i've had every opportunity and blessing in my own life   and i want the same for all americans  until that day comes  you will always find me on the front lines of democracy   fighting for the future  the way to continue our fight now   to accomplish the goals for which we stand   is to take our energy  our passion  our strength and do all we can to help elect barack obama the next president of the united states  today  as i suspend my campaign  i congratulate him on the victory he has won and the extraordinary race he has run  i endorse him  and throw my full support behind him  and i ask all of you to join me in working as hard for barack obama as you have for me  i have served in the senate with him for four years  i have been in this campaign with him for   months  i have stood on the stage and gone toe to toe with him in   debates  i have had a front row seat to his candidacy  and i have seen his strength and determination  his grace and his grit  in his own life  barack obama has lived the american dream  as a community organizer  in the state senate  as a united states senator   he has dedicated himself to ensuring the dream is realized  and in this campaign  he has inspired so many to become involved in the democratic process and invested in our common future  now when i started this race  i intended to win back the white house  and make sure we have a president who puts our country back on the path to peace  prosperity  and progress  and that's exactly what we're going to do by ensuring that barack obama walks through the doors of the oval office on january     i understand that we all know this has been a tough fight  the democratic party is a family  and it's now time to restore the ties that bind us together and to come together around the ideals we share  the values we cherish  and the country we love  we may have started on separate journeys   but today  our paths have merged  and we are all heading toward the same destination  united and more ready than ever to win in november and to turn our country around because so much is at stake  we all want an economy that sustains the american dream  the opportunity to work hard and have that work rewarded  to save for college  a home and retirement  to afford that gas and those groceries and still have a little left over at the end of the month  an economy that lifts all of our people and ensures that our prosperity is broadly distributed and shared  we all want a health care system that is universal  high quality  and affordable so that parents no longer have to choose between care for themselves or their children or be stuck in dead end jobs simply to keep their insurance  this isn't just an issue for me   it is a passion and a cause   and it is a fight i will continue until every single american is insured   no exceptions  no excuses  we all want an america defined by deep and meaningful equality   from civil rights to labor rights  from women's rights to gay rights  from ending discrimination to promoting unionization to providing help for the most important job there is  caring for our families  we all want to restore america's standing in the world  to end the war in iraq and once again lead by the power of our values  and to join with our allies to confront our shared challenges from poverty and genocide to terrorism and global warming  you know  i've been involved in politics and public life in one way or another for four decades  during those forty years  our country has voted ten times for president  democrats won only three of those times  and the man who won two of those elections is with us today  we made tremendous progress during the  s under a democratic president  with a flourishing economy  and our leadership for peace and security respected around the world  just think how much more progress we could have made over the past   years if we had a democratic president  think about the lost opportunities of these past seven years   on the environment and the economy  on health care and civil rights  on education  foreign policy and the supreme court  imagine how far we could've come  how much we could've achieved if we had just had a democrat in the white house  we cannot let this moment slip away  we have come too far and accomplished too much  now the journey ahead will not be easy  some will say we can't do it  that it's too hard  that we're just not up to the task  but for as long as america has existed  it has been the american way to reject  can't do  claims  and to choose instead to stretch the boundaries of the possible through hard work  determination  and a pioneering spirit  it is this belief  this optimism  that senator obama and i share  and that has inspired so many millions of our supporters to make their voices heard  so today  i am standing with senator obama to say  yes we can  together we will work  we'll have to work hard to get universal health care  but on the day we live in an america where no child  no man  and no woman is without health insurance  we will live in a stronger america  that's why we need to help elect barack obama our president  we'll have to work hard to get back to fiscal responsibility and a strong middle class  but on the day we live in an america whose middle class is thriving and growing again  where all americans  no matter where they live or where their ancestors came from  can earn a decent living  we will live in a stronger america and that is why we must elect barack obama our president  we'll have to work hard to foster the innovation that makes us energy independent and lift the threat of global warming from our children's future  but on the day we live in an america fueled by renewable energy  we will live in a stronger america  that's why we have to help elect barack obama our president  we'll have to work hard to bring our troops home from iraq  and get them the support they've earned by their service  but on the day we live in an america that's as loyal to our troops as they have been to us  we will live in a stronger america and that is why we must help elect barack obama our president  this election is a turning point election and it is critical that we all understand what our choice really is  will we go forward together or will we stall and slip backwards  think how much progress we have already made  when we first started  people everywhere asked the same questions  could a woman really serve as commander in chief  well  i think we answered that one  and could an african american really be our president  senator obama has answered that one  together senator obama and i achieved milestones essential to our progress as a nation  part of our perpetual duty to form a more perfect union  now  on a personal note   when i was asked what it means to be a woman running for president  i always gave the same answer  that i was proud to be running as a woman but i was running because i thought i'd be the best president  but i am a woman  and like millions of women  i know there are still barriers and biases out there  often unconscious  i want to build an america that respects and embraces the potential of every last one of us  i ran as a daughter who benefited from opportunities my mother never dreamed of  i ran as a mother who worries about my daughter's future and a mother who wants to lead all children to brighter tomorrows  to build that future i see  we must make sure that women and men alike understand the struggles of their grandmothers and mothers  and that women enjoy equal opportunities  equal pay  and equal respect  let us resolve and work toward achieving some very simple propositions  there are no acceptable limits and there are no acceptable prejudices in the twenty first century  you can be so proud that  from now on  it will be unremarkable for a woman to win primary state victories  unremarkable to have a woman in a close race to be our nominee  unremarkable to think that a woman can be the president of the united states  and that is truly remarkable  to those who are disappointed that we couldn't go all the way   especially the young people who put so much into this campaign   it would break my heart if  in falling short of my goal  i in any way discouraged any of you from pursuing yours  always aim high  work hard  and care deeply about what you believe in  when you stumble  keep faith  when you're knocked down  get right back up  and never listen to anyone who says you can't or shouldn't go on  as we gather here today in this historic magnificent building  the  th woman to leave this earth is orbiting overhead  if we can blast   women into space  we will someday launch a woman into the white house  although we weren't able to shatter that highest  hardest glass ceiling this time  thanks to you  it's got about   million cracks in it  and the light is shining through like never before  filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time  that has always been the history of progress in america  think of the suffragists who gathered at seneca falls in   and those who kept fighting until women could cast their votes  think of the abolitionists who struggled and died to see the end of slavery  think of the civil rights heroes and foot soldiers who marched  protested and risked their lives to bring about the end to segregation and jim crow  because of them  i grew up taking for granted that women could vote  because of them  my daughter grew up taking for granted that children of all colors could go to school together  because of them  barack obama and i could wage a hard fought campaign for the democratic nomination  because of them  and because of you  children today will grow up taking for granted that an african american or a woman can yes  become president of the united states  when that day arrives and a woman takes the oath of office as our president  we will all stand taller  proud of the values of our nation  proud that every little girl can dream and that her dreams can come true in america  and all of you will know that because of your passion and hard work you helped pave the way for that day  so i want to say to my supporters  when you hear people saying   or think to yourself    if only  or  what if  i say   please don't go there  every moment wasted looking back keeps us from moving forward  life is too short  time is too precious  and the stakes are too high to dwell on what might have been  we have to work together for what still can be  and that is why i will work my heart out to make sure that senator obama is our next president and i hope and pray that all of you will join me in that effort  to my supporters and colleagues in congress  to the governors and mayors  elected officials who stood with me  in good times and in bad  thank you for your strength and leadership  to my friends in our labor unions who stood strong every step of the way   i thank you and pledge my support to you  to my friends  from every stage of my life   your love and ongoing commitments sustain me every single day  to my family   especially bill and chelsea and my mother  you mean the world to me and i thank you for all you have done  and to my extraordinary staff  volunteers and supporters  thank you for working those long  hard hours  thank you for dropping everything   leaving work or school   traveling to places you'd never been  sometimes for months on end  and thanks to your families as well because your sacrifice was theirs too  all of you were there for me every step of the way  being human  we are imperfect  that's why we need each other  to catch each other when we falter  to encourage each other when we lose heart  some may lead  others may follow  but none of us can go it alone  the changes we're working for are changes that we can only accomplish together  life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness are rights that belong to each of us as individuals  but our lives  our freedom  our happiness  are best enjoyed  best protected  and best advanced when we do work together  that is what we will do now as we join forces with senator obama and his campaign  we will make history together as we write the next chapter in america's story  we will stand united for the values we hold dear  for the vision of progress we share  and for the country we love  there is nothing more american than that  and looking out at you today  i have never felt so blessed  the challenges that i have faced in this campaign are nothing compared to those that millions of americans face every day in their own lives  so today  i'm going to count my blessings and keep on going  i'm going to keep doing what i was doing long before the cameras ever showed up and what i'll be doing long after they're gone  working to give every american the same opportunities i had  and working to ensure that every child has the chance to grow up and achieve his or her god given potential  i will do it with a heart filled with gratitude  with a deep and abiding love for our country  and with nothing but optimism and confidence for the days ahead  this is now our time to do all that we can to make sure that in this election we add another democratic president to that very small list of the last   years and that we take back our country and once again move with progress and commitment to the future  thank you all and god bless you and god bless america "]]
