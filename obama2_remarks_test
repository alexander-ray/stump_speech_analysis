[["obama2", " i the president i  hello  parma  hello  ohio  well  it is good to be in parma  everybody  have a seat who can sit down   i laughter i  it is good to be here  and this now  this is the right time for a rally  now things have cooled off a little bit  and i had a beer in amherst  at ziggy's  so i'm feeling good  feeling steady  i want to first of all i want everybody to give wendy a big round of applause for the introduction  we've got some outstanding ohioans in the house  first of all  the mayor of parma  tim degeeter is here  stand up  tim  so everybody can see you  there you go  i don't know who the guy holding the mayor is  but i laughter i nah   i audience member i  that's jack   i the president i  oh  that's jack   i laughter i  got it  you guys have some of the best members of congress from this area  and nobody is fighting harder than your outstanding senator  sherrod brown  and his outstanding wife connie  who i love  we love connie  although  connie  i did tell sherrod he can take his tie off  i mean  it's   o'clock  we're in a park  it's hot   i laughter i  but anyway  you keep on working on him  two outstanding congresswomen  who are looking after ohio's middle class every single day betty sutton is here  and marcy kaptur is here  and i could not be prouder to have  as one of my campaign cochairs  your former governor  the outstanding ted strickland is here   i audience member i  and an outstanding president   i the president i  oh  and an outstanding president  okay   i laughter i  now  i just want to first of all say  thank you  guys  for taking your time to come out  i hope everybody had a wonderful fourth of july  we had a little barbecue in my backyard   i laughter i  it was little  had a few fireworks  some of you know that malia turned   yesterday  and she is just an incredible young lady  just like sasha is  now  she used to be young enough where i could convince her that all these fireworks were for her birthday  but she doesn't believe me anymore   i laughter i  and michelle sends her love  malia was having a sleepover with some of her friends  and michelle thought  you can't just have a house full of girls and no parental supervision   i laughter i  so just letting you know  but she says hi  the girls say hi  and bo say hi  now  you may not have noticed  but we're in the middle of campaign season here  and this will be one way or another  this will be my last campaign  which gets me to thinking about my first campaign  and i was a lawyer  and i was teaching law  and this seat the state senate seat came up  and i told michelle  some people had talked to me about running for office  what did she think  and she said  well  that's a dumb idea   i laughter i  but after i explained to her why i thought it might make sense for me to run  she joined in  and we didn't have a budget  we didn't have tv ads  we printed a bunch of stuff at kinko's i laughter i and we had a few friends who volunteered  and we started knocking on doors  and i'd go in front of the grocery store  and i'd shake hands  and we would march in parades  in fact  the fourth of july parade in hyde park  back in chicago  they had a tradition where they made folks who were in office or running for office dress up  and somebody had an outfit for me  it was sort of like a minuteman outfit with  like  a hat and sort of the cutoff pants  and my legs are kind of skinny  so i didn't look very good in them   i laughter i   i at this point  an audience member whistled i   i the president i  and then i won that race  and so i served in the state senate  and then i got the idea of running for the united states senate after serving   years in the state senate  and i decided to go to michelle and ask her what she thought  and she said  well  that's a dumb idea   i laughter i  but because i had had a chance as a state senator to travel the whole state of illinois  which is a lot like ohio it's a mix of big cities and rural communities and folks from every walk of life and i started just traveling the state  and i'd go to state fairs  and i'd we'd go to county fairs  and we'd stop in little towns and meet folks and go to vfw halls  and what i realized during that senate race  and what i realized when i first ran for the state senate  was the reason i got into politics was because  in this country  there is this core american idea that we celebrated yesterday  and that is if you work hard  if you take responsibility for yourself and your family  and you don't get discouraged when you hit some setbacks  you can make it if you try  the basic american bargain that says  it doesn't matter what you look like  where you come from  where you worship  the idea is that you don't have to be born into fame or fortune  if you're willing to apply yourself and work hard  you can make it  you can follow your dreams  and the reason i got into that first race way back when and the reason i ran for the senate and  ultimately  the reason i ran for president was because that had been available for my family  my grandparents participated in world war ii  my grandfather fought in patton's army  and my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line  but when my grandfather came back  he was able to study on the gi bill  and they were able to buy their first home with some help from the fha  america gave them that opportunity  didn't give them a handout  but gave them that chance  and when my mom  a single mom  was raising two kids and trying to get her education  there were grants and loans available  and she could instill a love of learning in me and my sister  and we had a chance to get a great education  and you look at michelle's family  her dad was what was called a stationary engineer at the water filtration plant in chicago  a blue collar worker  even though he had ms  he'd have to wake up an hour earlier than everybody else to get dressed and get to the job  but he never missed a day of work  and michelle's mom  she stayed at home raising the kids and then later became a secretary  they never had a lot  but they had a chance to give their kids this great education  and so my whole life  and michelle's whole life  was an example of this american dream  this idea that if you work hard  you can find a job that pays a living wage and you can afford a home  you won't go bankrupt when you get sick  you can retire with some dignity and respect  you can take a vacation  it may not be fancy  you might not be going to some fancy resort  but you can go with your kids and enjoy each other's company and see the amazing sights of this country  and the problem was that you could feel  over the last decade  how that dream was slipping away for too many people  they were working harder and harder  but it seemed like wages weren't going up  incomes weren't going up  opportunities weren't increasing  the cost of health care was going up  the cost of college was going up  gas prices going up  groceries going up  so that basic bargain felt like it was slipping away from too many people  that's what got me into politics  that's why i ran for the state senate  that's why i entered my first political race  that's why i'm running my last political race  because i want to make sure that the next generation  not just my kids  but everybody  has that same chance  that we get that bargain back for america's middle class  that's what sherrod is fighting for and marcy is fighting for and betty is fighting for and i am fighting for  that's what you believe in  that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  this these past   years have made it tough on everybody  we saw the middle class struggling and folks who were trying to get into the middle class  i want to say  by the way  when i talk about middle class  i'm also talking about poor folks who are doing the right thing and trying to get into the middle class  and middle class is also an attitude  it's not just about income  it's about knowing what's important and not measuring your success just based on your bank account  but it's about your values and being responsible and looking after each other and giving back   i audience member i  giving back   i the president i  giving back  and it was tough even before the crisis hit  and then this crisis hit  and the auto industry almost went under  and people lost their jobs  and people lost their homes  and we've been working     days a year  for the last   years to try to right the ship and recover  and we've seen progress   i audience member i  it's working   i the president i  we've seen progress  when some were saying  let's let detroit go bankrupt  i said let's bet on the american worker  and now that chrysler plant is churning out some of the best cars in the world  and gm is back on top  and ford is on the move  we've seen manufacturing start to come back to ohio  we've seen the unemployment rate drop  so we've made progress  but we all know we've got so much more work to do  there are too many folks still out of work  homes still underwater  too many kids are still trying to figure out how to pay for their college education  but you know what  these challenges had been building up over decades  and we knew we weren't going to turn it around overnight  what we wanted to do was make sure that we started moving in the right direction  moving forward  not moving backwards  and we've been able to do that  we've been moving forwards  and frankly  we've been moving forwards without a lot of help from the other side  we've been kind of yanking them  they've been on our ankles and pulling us back i laughter i but we've been moving forward  but the truth is  there is so much more we could be doing  and the reason i'm so glad you're here today is because the only way we are going to keep moving forward is with you  now  i know you probably are already sick of this election with all the commercials and all the nastiness that's out there and the foolishness and the misinformation and all the political reporting about polls and who's up and who's down  but look  i want you to understand  nothing could be bigger right now than the choice you're about to make  the choice you're about to make  because it's more than just being about two candidates or two political parties  this is about two fundamentally different visions of how we move forward  mr  romney  his allies in congress  they've got a particular view  they believe that if we cut taxes  for especially the wealthiest americans  about   trillion on top of the bush tax cuts  paid for by cutting education and cutting making medicare a voucher program and cutting programs for our kids  that somehow if we do that and we eliminate regulations that we've put in place thanks to the work of these great members of congress  so that we don't have taxpayer bailouts of wall street banks anymore that if we roll those back  that somehow all this is going to benefit you  that first  it will benefit wealthy investors  and then things will rain down on you and benefit you in some fashion  that's the theory  now  let me just say  this is a coherent theory  you can see it on their web sites  they don't make a secret about what they're planning to do  the only problem is we tried it  we tried it for about   years right before i was elected as president of the united states  and it didn't work  it didn't make the middle class stronger  job growth was sluggish  your wages and your incomes did not go up  it didn't grow our economy the way it needed to  and it culminated in the worst financial crisis we've had since the great depression  so their theory was tried  but it's a theory  i've got a different theory  i think they're wrong  as wendy said  i don't think we grow our economy from the top down  i think we grow the economy from the middle class out  i think  we grow the economy by making sure everybody has got a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules  and so when i look at how do we move forward  i say  we're making progress in manufacturing  let's make more progress  let's stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give them to companies that are investing right here in the united states of america  when i think about moving forward  i say  let's invest in advanced manufacturing in this  st century economy for us to make sure that we're at the forefront of advanced battery manufacturing so the next generation of cars are built here in america  investing in clean energy to make sure that solar panels and wind turbines are built here in the united states of america  those are smart investments  that's how we move forward  when i think about moving forward  i think about how do we make sure that american young people are the best educated in the world  so i want to hire new teachers  especially in math and science  and i want to train them better and pay them better  and i want to give   million more people the opportunity to go to a community college and train for the jobs that exist right now  and i want to make college more affordable for young people and bring tuition down  that's how we move forward  that's my vision for the future  and yes  i believe that we should have a health care system that works for middle class families  and i am couldn't be prouder of the work that we have done in getting this health care law passed  and there is so much misinformation out there  so i just want to clear up a couple of things  if you've got health insurance right now  here's what this bill means  it means that insurance companies can't drop you for no reason or when you need it most  it means that your kids can stay on your health insurance plan until they're   and have really gotten a job that provides them benefits  it means that they can't impose lifetime limits insurance companies can't impose lifetime limits so that when you really need it  suddenly they say  we don't have any more insurance for you  it's a patient's bill of rights for you if you have insurance  and if you don't have health insurance  then it gives you a chance to buy into a pool so that you get the same deal as folks who are working at big companies do  and if you're a senior on medicare  it means your prescription drug costs are going to be lower and we're going to close that donut hole that has hurt a lot of seniors  now  i think that was the right thing to do  that's part of moving forward  we need to have an american energy policy  we're producing more oil and gas than we have in a long time  and we're importing less oil from overseas than we have in the past  but we can keep on doing more  not only increasing production of traditional fuels  but in developing and inventing new fuels because we need to free ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil  and by the way  we can put people back to work in the process  that's moving forward  i want to rebuild america  i promised  i'd end the war in iraq  i ended the war in iraq  we're transitioning out of afghanistan  we've taken on al qaida  and we killed bin laden  and now i want to take half the money that we're no longer spending on war and use it to drive down our deficits  and i want to take the other half to start doing some nation building here in ohio  do some nation building here at home  put people back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our schools  laying broadband lines and high speed rail  that's how we build america  that's my idea of moving forward  so i've got a different vision  and nowhere is that vision  by the way  bigger than when it comes to how do we deal with our debt and our deficit  biggest contributors to our debt and our deficit  in addition to this recession  were two tax cuts that weren't paid for and two wars run on a credit card  and mr  romney's proposal to deal with this is another   trillion of tax cuts that aren't paid for  or if they're paid for  on the backs of you  that's not a plan to deal with our deficits  so what i've said is  look  we're going to get rid of programs that don't work  we don't want to waste money  we can't afford it  we don't have enough  and by the way  i'm not somebody who believes that every government program works  i don't think government can solve every problem  i don't think we can always help folks who don't want to help themselves  now  i don't care how much money we spend on schools if parents aren't parenting  so government can't do everything  but there are some things we have to do to grow the economy  so we've got to invest in education  we've got to invest in basic science and research  we've got to invest in infrastructure  we've got to make sure that medicare and social security are there for our seniors  so in addition to wise spending cuts  there's nothing wrong with asking the wealthy to pay a little more in taxes  now  let me just say this  i don't need a tax cut  mr  romney sure doesn't need a tax cut  i mean  i don't want a tax cut if it means  suddenly  students are having a tougher time affording going to college  i don't want a tax cut if it means seniors have to pay something more for medicare  and you know what  a lot of successful people agree with that  and the reason they do is because they remember what it was like when they weren't successful and somebody gave them a helping hand  and so i think a lot of people want to do the right thing  but we can't have a culture that just encourages selfishness and looking out for yourself and not looking out for anybody else  just looking out for you and not the next generation  so there are two fundamentally different visions about how we move the country forward  and the great thing about our democracy is you get to be the tiebreaker  it's up to you  it's up to you to decide what vision makes more sense  mr  romney's vision  the vision of his republican allies and some of the special interests in washington  we've tried that vision  and it didn't work  my vision  the last time we tried it was when bill clinton was president  and we created   million jobs  we had a budget surplus  and we created a whole lot of millionaires to boot  everybody did well  because we're in it together  and ultimately  that's what it comes down to  do you believe that we're on our own  all of us  or do you believe we're in it together  see  when i think about what's made america great  it's been our rugged individualism and our willingness to take risks and people going out there and starting a small business that becomes a medium sized business  becomes a big business  they start hiring  all those things have contributed  but what has also made us great is there are some things we've understood we do together  we build the hoover dam and the golden gate bridge  together  we take care of our veterans  together  we send them to school on the gi bill  together  we invest in basic research that creates the internet  together  we send a man to the moon  together  we build the interstate highway system  together  we do these things not because it helps any one of us individually  but because it gives opportunity for all of us to succeed  that's what's at stake in this election  and you are the tiebreaker  now  over the next   months  you will see a lot of stuff on tv  the other side is spending more money than we've ever seen before  i mean  you've got billionaires just writing   million checks  they just they're spending money like nobody's business  and all of them have the same message  all these ads  which basically is  the economy is bad  and it's obama's fault   i laughter i  i mean  they've got variations on this theme  but it's the same theme every time  sometimes they say  it's obama's fault because he thinks government is all the answer  sometimes it's because  well  obama  he doesn't have private sector experience making a lot of money like the other guy  some of it is  well  he just thinks everything is fine or he is in over his head  but it's all the same theme  and i think a lot of people are looking at this  they're saying  we don't know how this is going to turn out because we've never seen a sitting president outspent like this  with all this money and all these negative attacks  and maybe it'll work   i audience members i  no   i the president i  but it's a plan to run a campaign  it's not a plan to put people back to work  their plan is not a plan to grow the middle class  and when i think back to my first campaign  and i think back to that first senate campaign that i ran  what i always remember  what michelle and i learned  was folks can spend a whole lot of money and they can run a whole bunch of negative attacks  but when the american people decide what's right  when ordinary people are reminded of what's best in us  when we remember what our values are and we're willing to fight for them  when we're willing to say  you know what  this is not just about me  but this is about my kids and my grandkids  and so i'm going to work as hard as i can and i'm going to talk to my friends and i'm going to talk to my neighbors  i'm going to talk to my coworkers and i know it's going to be frustrating and i know it's going to be hard sometimes and there are going to be setbacks  but i'm going to stay with it  and enough people start having that feeling  nothing can stop them  nothing can stop you  i don't care how much the other side spends  you cannot be stopped once you have decided what is right and what is true  in the last election  i told people  i'm not a perfect man and i certainly wasn't going to be a perfect president  but i said  i'd always tell you what i thought and i'd always tell you where i stood and i'd spend every single day fighting as hard as i knew how for you to try to make sure that every single one of you had the same chance as my family had because i saw myself in you  i saw my hopes and dreams in you  and when i see your kids  i see my kids  and when i see your grandparents  i see my grandparents  and i have kept that promise  and as long as i have the privilege of being your president  i will keep that promise because i still believe in you  and if you still believe in me  and if you're willing to stand with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls with me  we will finish what we started in   and we will grow this middle class  and we will strengthen america  and we'll remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america  thank you "], ["obama2", " i the president i  thank you  hello  virginia  all right  hello  wildcats  a couple people i want to just acknowledge first of all  didn't stratton do a great job on the introduction  give him a big round of applause  you've got one of the finest members of congress that we've got  gerry connolly in the house  and our candidate for the  th congressional district  kristin cabral is here  and i want to thank martin grimm  the principal of centreville high  i just talked to martin and i asked him  how long you been principal  he said    days   i laughter i  so i said  good luck   i laughter i  i'm sure he is going to do a great job  and i had a chance to meet some of the student body council here at centreville  and they could not be more impressive  so  parents  you should know your kids are turning out outstanding  we are proud of them  now  i have to say this is my last political campaign   i audience members i  aww   i the president i  no  it's a good thing  michelle at least thinks it's a good thing   i laughter i  i'm term limited   i audience member i  i love you   i the president i  i love you back  there she is  so this is my last political campaign  and it got me a little nostalgic  so i started thinking about some of my early campaigns  when i was running for the state senator  when i was running for u s  senator back in my home state of illinois  some illinoisans in the house  and illinois is a lot like virginia because it's incredibly diverse  you've got big cities  you've got small towns  there are farming communities  there are suburban communities  folks from every walk of life  black  white  latino  asian  native american  you name it  and as i was traveling around in those first campaigns now  back then i was doing my own driving  and there was no mapquest  so you had to get the old maps i laughter i that you couldn't figure out how to fold back  and i'd get lost all the time   i laughter i  and sometimes  i'd get to an event  and i'd have to find a parking spot  and that would take a while  and then  i'd be coming in late  but what inspired me so much in that first race was the fact that no matter where i went  there was a certain common thread  a certain common theme  a certain set of stories that were consistent in every community  and those stories reminded me of my own family story  so i'd meet an elderly veteran  and i think back to my grandparents  my grandfather fought in world war ii  and while he was away  my grandmother  in addition to looking after my mom who had just been born  also worked on a bomber assembly line  and when my grandfather came back  he was able to go to college because of the gi bill  and they were able to afford their first home through an fha loan  and sometimes  i'd travel  and i'd meet a single mom  and that would remind me of my mother  who had to raise me and my sister pretty much on her own  with the help of my grandparents  because my father had left  she didn't have a lot of money  but she was able to work and go to school at the same time and help other people through her work and then ultimately give me and my sister the best education this world has to offer  and then sometimes  i'd be talking to some working folks  and i'd think about michelle's family  her dad was a blue collar worker  he worked at the water filtration plant in chicago  and he had ms  so by the time i met him  he could barely walk  he had to use two canes  and he had to wake up an hour earlier than everybody else to get to the job  it took him that long to get dressed and get ready  but he never missed a day of work  and michelle's mom  after staying at home for a while  she worked as a secretary  and they lived in a small apartment above a house that somebody else owned  but somehow they were able to give michelle and her brother this incredible education so they could achieve dreams that they wouldn't have even imagined  and so the point is that during this campaign  during all the campaigns i've run  what i've always been moved by  what's always inspired me is that at the center of our stories is this basic american idea  this core american dream  that says  in this country  like no other  if you are willing to work hard  you can make it if you try  if you're willing to meet your responsibilities to not only yourself and your family  but to your community and your country  you can enjoy the security of a middle class life  and that's not a matter of how much is in your bank account  it means that you can find a job that supports a family  it means that you can get a home to call your own  it means you're not bankrupt when you get sick  it means maybe you can take a vacation once in a while  nothing fancy  but you have the chance to spend time with your family and enjoy their company  it means that you can send your kids to a good school  and if they're willing to work hard  they can get a great education and go on as far as their dreams take them  and it means that you can retire with some dignity and some respect  it's that basic bargain that makes this country great  it's that basic bargain that built the economic superpower that we are today  it's that basic bargain that made us the envy of the world  and what i think we all understood back in   was that for almost a decade  that dream felt like it was slipping away  for too many people  harder work didn't result in higher incomes or higher wages  for too many people  they saw their costs of health care or college or gas or groceries going up and up and up  while basically what they were bringing in stayed stagnant or even went down  and so we came together not just democrats  but republicans and independents too because we're not democrats of republicans first  we're americans first  so we came together to fight for that american idea  we understood that we had to bring about a change  because we understood that the economy works in this country when it works for everybody  not just for the few  but look  we knew that turning this thing around wasn't going to be easy  the challenges we faced  the roadblocks  the barriers for middle class families  they hadn't arisen overnight  they weren't going to be solved overnight  we knew that it was going to take probably more than   year or one term or maybe even one president  but we were willing to try  we wanted to get started  and so what we didn't understand  though  was some of the problems had been building up so much that we'd end up seeing the worst financial crisis since the great depression  and that crisis has resulted in millions of people losing their jobs and home values declining and folks having a tough time  and for the last   years  we have fought back  to create   million new jobs and   new manufacturing jobs  to start righting the ship so we can start moving in the right direction  but we've got so much more work to do  here's the good news  for all these tough times  the american people are tougher  people may have gotten knocked down  but they've gotten back up  what has not changed since   is the character of this country  the character of its people  and so our mission now is the same mission that we had in   yes  it's to get people back to work right away and to solve some of these housing problems right away  but it's also  how do we build an economy that lasts and works for everybody  how do we build an economy where hard work pays off  whether you're starting a business or punching a clock  you know that if you put in the effort  you'll get ahead  that's what this campaign is about  that's what my presidency has been about  we've got more work to do  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  let me say this  it's popular sometimes among some pundits to say or commentators to say well  maybe america's best days are behind us  i don't believe that   i audience members i  no   i the president i  we remain the most powerful country on earth by far  we've got all the ingredients to make the  st century the american century just like the  th century  the problem we have is not a lack of solutions  it's not good ideas  the problem we have right now is we've got a stalemate in washington  and this stalemate is not just a difference between two candidates or even two political parties  it is a it represents two fundamentally different ideas about how we move this country forward  my opponent and his congressional allies  they believe in what i call top down economics   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  their basic view is that if we cut taxes trillions of dollars  mostly for those at the very top even if it means cutting education funding  even if it means cutting basic research  even if it means underfunding our infrastructure  and even if it means making medicare a voucher system that somehow that's going to be good for everybody   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  so that's one big part of their idea  is you cut taxes for folks at the top  their second big idea is if you eliminate regulations on oil companies or insurance companies or credit card companies or polluters  that somehow that will free up the engine of growth  so those are basically their two those are the only two ideas they have  don't take my word for it  go on their web sites   i laughter i  look at the republican budget in the house of representatives  that's their basic approach  they believe that somehow all these benefits are going to trickle down if we just implement their plan  now  there's nothing wrong with having an idea  a theory  and testing it out  here's the thing  we tested it out for almost a decade  we've tried this before  and guess what  virginia  it did not work  we tried almost exactly what they are proposing  and here are the results  we went from surpluses to deficits  we had the most sluggish job growth in decades  the average income of middle class families actually went down  and it culminated in this mess that we are still digging ourselves out from under  now  normally  in your own lives  if you do something over and over again and it doesn't work i laughter i at some point you decide  let's try something new  so we don't need more top down economics  i believe in a middle out economics  a bottom up economics  i believe that when hard working americans are doing well  everybody does well  that's been our history  that's been the evidence  that's why i ran for president  to fight on behalf of the middle class and those who are striving to get in to the middle class  and that's why i'm running again for president of the united states   i the president i  so let's just take a few examples of the contrast between their approach and what i'm proposing  when the auto industry was on the brink of collapse  my opponent said  let's let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i said  let's bet on american workers and american ingenuity  and you know what  gm is number one again  chrysler is selling cars again  ford is on the move  the u s  auto industry has come roaring back  and what happened in the auto industry i want to see happen in manufacturing all across this country  right here in virginia  we've invested in advanced manufacturing because we want to beat out countries like germany and china  i want the great inventions to be done here  and i want great new products created here  which is why and this is another contrast whereas my opponent  in his private business  was investing in companies that the washington post calls  pioneers  of outsourcing  i believe in insourcing  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give those tax breaks that are investing right here in virginia  right here in the united states of america  hiring american workers to make american products to sell around the world  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  i'm running because  after a decade of war  i said we were going to end the war in iraq  and we did  thanks to the incredible efforts of our brave men and women in uniform  thanks to our veterans and their sacrifices  we've been able to decimate al qaida's leadership  bin laden is no more  we're transitioning out of afghanistan  and so  after a decade of war  i think it's a good time for us to take half the money that we save  that used to be spent on war  to pay down our deficit  and let's take the other half and rebuild america  do some nation building here at home  let's rebuild our infrastructure  let's rebuild our roads and our bridges  northern virginia knows a little bit about traffic  let's build broadband lines and high speed rail  let's expand our ports and improve our airports  that's what's going to keep us at the cutting edge of a  st century economy  and we've got tens of thousands of construction workers ready to be put back to work  why wouldn't we do some nation building here at home  now  this is a disagreement i've got with the guy who's leading the other party  that's the choice that we've got to make  i'm running to make sure that the united states has the best education system in the world  i want to hire new  outstanding teachers  especially in math and science  we've already done work to make college more affordable by making sure that your student loan rates didn't double those students who are here by providing tuition tax credits that have saved millions of families thousands of dollars  by expanding the pell grant  but now i want to actually reduce the cost of college so young people aren't coming out with thousands of dollars worth of debt  i want to give   million more americans the chance to attend community colleges and get the technical training they need to get the jobs that are being created right now here in virginia and around america  because in the  st century  a higher education i don't care whether it's a  year  or a  year  or a postdoc  or whatever it is  an advanced degree beyond high school that's not a luxury  that's an economic necessity  that's what our young people deserve  that's what i intend to give them  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  i'm running to continue to strengthen our housing market  which has been one of the biggest drags on our economy  so i told congress  let's create an opportunity where every american can refinance their homes and take advantage of historically low rates  it would save the average family   a year  my opponent's plan is to let the foreclosures play themselves out and let the market hit bottom   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  that's not a plan  that's not a solution  that's a problem   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  but that's a difference in our approaches  mr  romney thinks that i made a bad decision by repealing  don't ask  don't tell  i think you should be able to fight for your country regardless of whom you love  my opponent wants to restrict the health care options for women  i believe women should make their own health care choices  my opponent believes that we should have our immigrants in this country if they were kids and were brought here through no fault of their own and are americans in every respect except a piece of paper that somehow we shouldn't show them the kind of compassion that we would show our own kids  i disagree  i think we should have comprehensive immigration reform  because we're a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws  and we can have tough border security and improve our immigration system  but when i look out at what's happening in virginia  our immigration is a strength not a weakness  that's a difference  mr  romney wants to repeal the affordable care act   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  let me just say that i passed this bill because it was the right thing to do  the supreme court has spoken  we are implementing this law  if you've got health insurance  the only thing that happens for you is that you've got more security  because insurance companies can't jerk you around and use fine print to somehow restrict your care  if you're a young person  you can stay on your parent's plan up until you're   years old  seniors are seeing lower costs for their prescription drugs  women are getting free preventive care for things like cervical cancer  if you don't have health insurance  we're going to help you get it  and if you can afford health insurance and you don't buy it  we're not going to let you pass those costs on to other people  so the affordable care act was the right thing to do  health care was the right thing to do  we're not going backwards  we're going forward  that's a difference in this election  now  let me talk about one more big contrast in this election  and that is  how do we deal with our deficit and our debt  the other side says this is our most important problem  we've got to look out for future generations  well  let's look at what they've actually proposed  they're proposing  on top of continuing all the bush tax cuts  even for the wealthiest americans  to also then have another   trillion in tax cuts    percent of which would go to the wealthiest americans   i audience members   i boo   i the president i  no  i mean  this is on their web site  their proposal is in congress right now  and the only way to pay for this would be to gut our investments in transportation  education  basic research in things like alzheimer's and cancer  voucherize the medicare system  and they will not ask for a single dime of additional revenue from those who can afford to pay it  i think that's that's not a recipe for economic growth  so what i've said is  look  middle class families  folks who are making   or less    percent of americans  you shouldn't see your taxes go up one dime  you don't need to  your income taxes should stay constant  and i've said to congress let's go ahead and get that done now  let's give   percent of folks certainty right now  by the way    percent of small businesses earn less than   so the vast majority of people would get immediate relief  let's cut programs that don't work  i've already made a trillion dollars worth of cuts  not every government program works  government can't always solve every problem  government can't help folks who don't want to help themselves  our education system won't improve just because of more money  it also involves parents instilling a love of learning in their children  but there's no reason why we can't make the investments we probably had somebody who fainted  that happens sometimes when you guys got to stay hydrated  we'll get a paramedic in there  they'll be all right  just give them space  they'll be okay  they'll be okay  yes  they'll be fine  so the thing that we've got to make sure of  though  is that we continue to make the investments we need to grow the economy  and we can bring down our deficit  get control of our debt by asking folks like me to do a little bit more  now  let me just say this  just like we've tried their plan  we've tried what i'm talking about too  a guy named bill clinton did it  and we ended up having record surpluses    million new jobs  and the folks at the top did really well also  because when the middle class and working people are doing well  everybody does well  small businesses do well  big businesses do well  millionaires do well  billionaires do well  everybody does well when the economy is growing in a way where everybody prospers  and so we've got this fundamental choice in this election  and the question is  how bad are we going to work for our vision  because this is going to be a close election  virginia  i want everybody to understand this  look  it was close the last time  it will be even closer this time  it will be even closer this time  and we are seeing more money spent on negative ads than ever before  folks just writing   million checks because of this  i citizens united i  opinion  undisclosed donations   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and so you are going to be inundated every single day  you're already seeing it  and they're all going to have a scary voice   i laughter i  and the ads  they've got a very simple message  which is  you know what  the economy is not where it needs to be  and it's obama's fault  that's their only message  they'll have variations on the theme  but it's the same theme  now  i might be worried about that if it wasn't for the fact that you taught me something in   what you taught me was that the american people  when they get together  when they are determined  when they cut through all the nonsense and they say  this is what matters  this is what's right  this is what's true when you tap into those stories of our parents and our grandparents and our great grandparents  folks who may have come here as immigrants  maybe were brought here on slave ships  folks who came here  but understood that there was something about this country where we don't have to settle for what is today  we can dream of what might be we're going to fight  we're going to struggle  we're going to push together to build the kind of perfect union that the founders talked about  when you decide we're going to move forward  we move forward   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  so  virginia  if you believe  as i do  in an economy where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody has the same set playing by the same set of rules  if you believe  as i believe  that we're in this together  that for all our individual initiative and all our self reliance  there are some things we do best together  that that's how we educated a generation on the gi bill  that's how we built the hoover dam and the golden gate bridge  that's how we sent a man to the moon  that's how we invented the internet  if you believe that we rise or fall together as one people  then i'm confident we're going to win  i'm confident we will be successful  and i want to remind you  back in   i tried to keep my promises to ones that i could keep  i said i'd end the war in iraq  i ended the war in iraq  i said that i'd make sure middle class families weren't getting hit by higher taxes  your taxes have gone down an average of   but my most important promise was telling you that i wasn't a perfect man michelle could have told you that i laughter i that i wasn't a perfect president  but that i'd always tell you where i stood  i'd always tell you what i thought  and i would spend every single waking moment as president fighting as hard as i knew how for you  because i saw myself in you because when i see your grandparents  i see my grandparents  when i see your children  i see my children  because i have faith and confidence in you  the american people  i have kept that promise  i believe in you  and if you still believe me  and you're willing to stand up and fight for it  we'll finish what we started in   and remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  akron  oh  it is good to be in akron  ohio  again  a couple people i want to acknowledge  first of all  please give jenna a big round of applause for that great introduction  i was telling jenna before we came out  i just love nurses  and for her to be looking after people every single day  that's what it's all about  so i am so impressed with her  a couple other people i want to acknowledge  russ pry  summit county executive  is here  now  your mayor  don plusquellic is i very much appreciate the fact that he had a little bit of surgery on his leg  just got out of the hospital  got wheeled in here i laughter i  he's not going to be able to stay  but i'm grateful for him taking the time to come  and i want to say thank you to all the neighborhood leaders who are here  thank you  you guys are what this campaign is all about  and   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  thank you  thank you  i also want to make sure we give it up for all our outstanding u s  of a  athletes who are competing in london right now  there are a whole bunch of ohioans representing our country over there  when wrestling gets underway next week  we'll be rooting for army specialist justin lester  right here from akron  he may be wearing a different uniform  but he is still fighting for the united states of america  on the way over here  i had a chance to speak to michael phelps  that who's won more medals than anybody  and then i spoke to the women's gymnastic team  now  let me just say  i know how to run  although i don't run as fast as these guys  i know how to swim  although i don't swim as fast  these gymnasts  i don't understand what they're doing   i laughter i  i cannot even walk on a balance beam  they're doing back flips and little  little  itty bitty young ladies  unbelievable  so we could not be prouder of them  now  let me just say  unless you have been hiding your tv set i laughter i or your cable is broke  you may be aware that there is a fairly intense political campaign going on right now   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  the reason this campaign is so intense is because the choice that we're going to be facing in november could not be bigger  this is not just a choice between two candidates  it's not just a choice between two parties  it is a choice about two fundamentally different visions for where we go in the future  two fundamentally different paths for our country  the direction that we choose the direction that you choose when you walk into that voting booth it will not just have an impact on your lives  it will have an impact on your children's lives and your grandchildren's lives  it will impact america for decades to come   i audience member i  that's why we vote for you   i the president i  now    years ago  we all came together democrats  but we also had independents  we had some republicans to restore the basic bargain that built this country  that made us into an economic powerhouse  it was a bargain  it was a deal that says if you work hard here in america  you should be rewarded for that work  it's a deal that says if you put in enough effort  if you act responsibly  then you should be able to find a job that pays the bills  you should be able to afford a home that you call your own  you should be able to count on health care when you get sick  you should be able to put away enough to retire with dignity and respect  and most of all  you should be able to give your children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger and do more than you could ever imagine  it's a simple promise  it's a promise that i've lived out in my life and michelle has lived out in hers  it is   i audience member i  we love michelle   i the president i  i know you all love michelle  it is the promise that's at the heart of this country  this idea that here in america  you can make it if you try  and it had been slipping away for almost a decade  we had seen sluggish job growth and jobs getting shipped overseas  and your incomes were flat or going down  costs of everything from health care to college were going up  and it culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  now  we knew that restoring that american dream would not be easy  we knew it was going to take more than one year or one term or maybe even one president  and that was before the middle class got hammered by this recession  and we saw millions of our friends and neighbors get hurt  lose homes  lose jobs  but over the last   years  we've worked to make progress    million new jobs created  half a million new manufacturing jobs  they'd counted the auto industry out  and now it is coming back stronger than ever  right here in ohio and all across the country  we passed health care so you could have security if you get sick  we passed reforms to make sure that wall street could not act in the same reckless manner that almost brought the economy to its knees  we ended the war in iraq  and we're taking care of our veterans  because if you fought for this country  you should not have to fight for a job or a roof over your head when you come home  now  we still have a long way to go  but there's one thing that this crisis has not changed  it hasn't changed who we are  it hasn't changed our character  it hasn't changed what makes us great  it hasn't changed what brought us together in   we just feel a greater sense of urgency about it  our first order of business has been to recover the jobs and the wealth that was lost in this crisis  but we're not going to stop there  we're going to reclaim the financial security that's been slipping away for more than a decade  our job isn't just to put people back to work  we want an economy where that work pays off  so that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from  here in america  you can make it if you try  that's what this campaign is about  fighting for the middle class and growing our middle class  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  there are no quick fixes or easy solutions to the challenges we face  but there is no doubt in my mind we've got the capacity to meet them  we've got the best workers in the world  we've got the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best scientists and researchers  the best colleges  and the best universities  we are still a young nation  we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity  people want to come here from every corner of the globe  so no matter how tough things get  this is not a country that quits  there isn't a country on earth that wouldn't gladly change places with us  what's standing in our way right now is not the lack of good ideas  what's standing in our way is our politics  we've got a stalemate in washington  we've got republicans in congress who have clung to the view the uncompromising view that the only way to move ahead is to go back to the same  tired solutions that got us into this mess in the first place   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  they've got a basic theory  i call it top down economics  and the basic idea is  is that if you give more tax breaks to the very wealthy and you get rid of regulations on banks and polluters and health insurance companies  then somehow everybody is going to prosper  ohio  you know better  we tried that  it did not work  america is not built from the top down  america is built from the middle out  america is built from the bottom up  america is built by farmers and factory workers and small businesses and companies that send american products overseas  not jobs overseas  that's the country we're fighting for  that's the economy that we need to build together  and we are not going to get there doing the same kind of stuff that these folks are talking about now  we're not going to get there if we spend more money on tax cuts for folks like me who don't need them and we're not even asking for them  and yet the centerpiece of my opponent's entire economic plan is not only to extend the bush tax cuts  but then to add a new   trillion tax cut on top of it   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  the bulk of this would go to the wealthiest americans  a lot of it would go to the top   percent  pay attention here  folks making more than   million a year the top one tenth of   percent they would get a tax cut under mr  romney's plan that is worth almost a quarter of a million dollars    they would save under his plan   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  hold on  it gets worse  my opponent says he's going to pay for this   trillion plan  but under this plan  guess who gets the bill for these   tax cuts   i audience members i  no   i the president i  you do  and you don't have to take my word for it  just today an independent  nonpartisan organization  they crunched all the numbers  they looked at his plan  this wasn't me  this wasn't my team  this was an independent group  one of the guys who did the analysis used to work for bush   i laughter i  so they found that if governor romney wants to keep his word and pay for his plan  of this   trillion tax cut  the only way to do it is to cut tax breaks that you  middle class families  depend on   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  the home mortgage deduction you use to pay for your home  the health care deduction that your employers use to provide you health care  some of the tax credits we've put in place to send your kids to college  what this means is the average middle class family with children would be hit with a tax increase of more than    i audience members i  no   i the president i  now  i think a lot of people are willing to sacrifice to bring down the deficit  to defend our country  but he's not asking you to contribute more to pay down the deficit  he's not asking you to do it to invest   i at this point  an audience member collapsed i   i the president i  i'm sure they're okay  sometimes folks faint because they've been standing too long  so we just need a paramedic right here in the front  they'll be okay  just give them room  that's all  this happens to me all the time   i laughter i  it means i've been talking too long   i audience members i  no   i the president i  they'll be okay  just give them space  now  let me make sure people understand this  they're asking you to pay an extra   not to pay down the deficit  not to invest in our kids' education  mr  romney is asking you to pay more so that people like him get a tax cut   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  in order to afford no  we can break it down further  in order to afford just a tax cut for somebody like mr  romney    families like yours would have to pay another   in taxes each year and every year  not just one year  every year  now  does that sound like a plan you can afford   i audience members i  no   i the president i  how many people like that plan   i audience members i  none   i the president i  does that sound like the kind of future that our country can afford   i audience members i  no   i the president i  ohio  we do not need more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  we need tax cuts for working americans  we need tax cuts for families who are trying to raise their kids  and trying to keep them healthy and trying to send them to college and trying to put a roof over their heads  we don't need tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas  we need tax breaks for companies that are investing here in akron  ohio  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  so i've got a different plan  i've got a different plan  four years ago  i promised middle class tax cuts  i kept that promise  the typical family is paying about   less in taxes than they were when i came into office  so what i've said is  let's keep taxes exactly where they are on the first   of everybody's income  so if your family makes under  like   percent of americans do you won't see your income taxes increase by one single dime  now  if you've been lucky or you've been successful  so that you're in the other   percent of americans  like i am  all we're asking is that we pay a little bit more so that we can pay down our deficit and so we can invest in things like education that will help us grow  and listen  akron  i don't believe government can solve every problem  not every government program works  government can't help somebody who doesn't want to help themselves  so we're cutting things that don't work  i've already cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending  but we've got to balance that  and i'm not going to pay for massive new tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires by gutting the investments that we need to keep the middle class strong  i want to make sure we're investing in hiring new teachers  especially in math and science  i want to make sure that we're putting folks back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges  our airports  i want to make sure that we're investing in our community colleges so they can train people for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  i want to make sure we're investing in basic science and research to keep our technological edge  and if we're going to bring down our deficit and do those things and make sure that medicare is there for our seniors and make sure social security is there for our seniors  then we've got to make choices  and all i'm asking is  the folks like me and mr  romney go back to the rates that we paid under bill clinton  and if you remember  that was when the economy created nearly   million new jobs  the biggest budget surplus in history  and here's the kicker it was good for folks at the top too  because here's what happens  when middle class folks and folks who are working to get into the middle class  when they're getting a decent wage  when their tax bill isn't too high  they've got a little more money in their pockets  and then they go to the store  and they buy a new appliance  or they finally get rid of that old beater and buy a new car  and maybe a student buys a new computer  and so  suddenly  businesses have customers  and that's how we make the economy grow  so  ohio  look  this is a choice  if you believe that mr  romney's plan will make you better off   i audience members i  no   i the president   i if you believe it's okay to just set our sights lower we can't afford to help young people go to college  we can't afford to rebuild our roads  we can't afford basic research if you believe that  then go ahead and send these folks to washington for the next few years   i audience members i  no   i the president i  but let me ask you  wouldn't we be better off if we kept fighting for the things that have always made us strong   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  if we fight to make sure our young people get the education they need  aren't we going to be better off if we keep developing new energy sources here in america   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  wouldn't we be better off if we're investing in manufacturing so we're selling goods stamped around the world  made in akron  ohio  made in the united states of america  will we be better off   years from now or   years from now or   years from now if we've got the courage to keep working  to keep striving  to keep fighting for what's true and right and best about america   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  that's what i believe  that's why i'm running for president  but i want you to know  akron  my hair may be grayer i laughter i but my determination is stronger than ever  my faith in the american people my faith in you is stronger than ever  and if you still believe in me like i believe in you  if you're willing to stand with me and organize with me and march with me and vote with me  knock on some doors with me  and make some phone calls with me and recruiting your friends and neighbors with me  i promise you we will win the state of ohio  we will win this election  we will finish what we started  and we will remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  everybody  thank you  it's good to be back  thank you so much  it is good to be back in iowa  and it's good to be back in boone county  a couple of folks i want to acknowledge  first of all  your outstanding former governor and now  i think  the best secretary of agriculture we've ever had  tom vilsack  a great friend of mine  my cochair for my campaign when i was just getting started in    he took a risk on me when nobody could pronounce my name tom miller is in the house  attorney general of the great state of iowa  and please give dave a big round of applause for the great introduction  dave may have mentioned he is a music teacher  and i told him that malia and sasha have been practicing their piano   i laughter i  and malia plays a little flute  but he mentioned that he thought he had heard me sing  and he thought that i had really good pitch  so i'm so dave says he's got a band  and maybe after i'm finished with the presidency  he said maybe i could be front man for the band  he said i might be maybe i could be lead singer  that would be all right  but listen  it is wonderful to be back in iowa  it is wonderful to see some familiar faces and some good friends on a beautiful summer day  it was on your front porches and in some of your backyards where our movement for change started  we spent a lot of time in iowa  and i felt like an adopted son of iowa  we were on we took bus tours all throughout the state  although i've got to admit the bus wasn't as nice as the one i've got now   i laughter i  and we went to school gyms and family farms and small businesses all across the state  but here's the thing  our journey is not over  it's not done  so i'm going to spend the next   days driving all the way across the state  just like we did in  from council bluffs all the way to the quad cities and i'm going to work just as hard  maybe harder  in this campaign as i did in the last one  because the choice that you face in november couldn't be bigger  it is not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties  but more than any election in recent memory  this is a choice between two fundamentally different visions about how we move this country forward  and the direction that we choose the direction that you choose when you walk into that voting booth in november is going to have an impact not just on your lives  but on the lives of these young people here  the lives of your children  lives of your grandchildren for decades to come  think about it  when we came together   years ago and it wasn't just democrats  we had independents and some republicans get involved the idea was to restore the basic bargain that made this country great  the basic idea that says if you work hard in this country  then you can get ahead  that if you put in the effort and you are responsible  then you can find a job that pays the bills  you can have a home that you call your own  you won't go bankrupt when you get sick  you can retire with some dignity and some respect  and maybe most importantly  you know that your kids can get a great education and they can dream bigger and do even better than you did  that is the core of the american dream  that's the american promise  now  the problem is  is that we had gone through a decade where that promise wasn't being met  it wasn't being kept  so we had gone through a decade where jobs were being shipped overseas  where you were working harder  but you were bringing in less  costs of college  costs of health care were all going up  cost of food  cost of gas all were going up  we ran two wars on a credit card  tax cuts we didn't need and that didn't create jobs  and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  so we knew that meeting these challenges that had been building up for over a decade  that it wasn't going to be easy  we knew it was going to take more than one year or one term or even one president  but what we also knew was that americans are tougher than tough times  and so  even though this crisis that hit us in   and   was bad even though a lot of folks lost their jobs and a lot of folks lost homes and a lot of folks lost savings  so that the middle class felt even more under the gun than they were before what we knew was that the american people are resilient and we are tough  and so  for the last   years  we've rolled up our sleeves  and we've worked hard  and small businesses have kept their doors open  and folks  even if they got laid off  they've retrained to find new jobs  and we created   million new jobs  half a million more in manufacturing  the auto industry is back on top  and so we've made progress but we've got a lot more work to do  we've got a lot more work to do  now   i audience member i  we can do it   i the president i  we can do it  i agree  we can  now  here's the thing  some people  they're naysayers  and they say  oh  america is on decline  and they try to paint things as dark as possible  especially during election time  but here's what i want everybody to know  we've got so many things going for us compared to the rest of the world  we've still got the best workers in the world  we've got the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best scientists and the best researchers in the world  we've got the best colleges and the best universities in the world  we know how to work hard  and we're a young country  and we're a country that draws on the diversity of folks who want to come here from all around the world to be part of this american dream  and most importantly  the crisis has not changed our character  it hasn't changed who we are  it hasn't changed our sense of determination and our sense of neighborliness and our understanding that we're in this thing together  and so we've come together  just like we did in   because our mission is not yet finished  we are here to build an economy where hard work pays off  and so no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from  you can make it if you try here in america  that's what this campaign is about and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  just like   i audience member i  forty more beers   i the president i   i laughter i  just as i said that we've got a lot of things going for us  there aren't any quick fixes or easy solutions to some of our challenges  we're going to have to keep working  we're going to meet these challenges  but the main problem we've got is not a lack of good ideas  it's not that we don't have good solutions to our problems  the big problem we've got right now is politics in washington  the big problem we've got is one party just thinks that compromise is a dirty word  and they've got an economic theory that basically wants to go back to the old top down economics that got us into this mess in the first place  now  look  over the weekend my opponent chose as his running mate the ideological leader of the republicans in congress  and i've gotten to know congressman ryan  he's a good man  he's a family man  he's a very articulate spokesperson for governor romney's vision  the problem is  it's the wrong vision for america  it's a vision that i fundamentally disagree with  their main recipe for solving america's problems is getting rid of regulations on big corporations and big banks and then giving more tax breaks to the wealthiest americans  and their theory is that somehow that's going to lead to jobs and prosperity for everybody  in fact  the centerpiece of governor romney's entire economic plan you heard this from dave is a new   trillion tax cut  a lot of it going to the wealthiest americans  now  keep in mind  these are the folks who say the deficit and the debt are the biggest problem we've got  and yet they now want to give a   trillion tax cut  i know these numbers get so big  but i just want you to get a sense  our entire defense budget annually is   billion  so what this means is  a   trillion tax break over   years  that's the equivalent of the entire defense budget going out as a tax cut every single year  now  keep in mind that this is going disproportionately to the wealthiest americans  last week  we found out that governor romney expects you  middle class families  to pick up the tab for this big tax cut   i audience members i  no   i the president i  and please don't take my word for it  you can go to their web sites and look at their plan  and then independent economists have looked at this thing  and they said that governor romney's tax plan would actually raise taxes on middle class families with children by an average of    i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  keep in mind  this is not   to reduce the deficit or to grow jobs or to invest in education or make college more affordable or to rebuild our roads  this is   to give another   tax cut to people making more than   million a year   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  let me just see a show of hands  how many folks are making more than   million a year   i laughter i  okay  this guy back here   i laughter i  i'm looking for a campaign contribution   i laughter i  let me tell you something  they have tried to sell us this trickle down fairy dust before  and it did not work then  it won't work now  it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to cut the deficit  and it's not a plan to move our economy forward  we don't need more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  we don't need a tax cut for mr  romney  we don't need a tax cut for me  we need tax relief for middle class families who are out there working to make sure that their kids are healthy and their kids can go to college  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for president because i've got a different idea  i've got a different idea than mr  romney  when i came into office  i promised that i would cut middle class taxes  and you know what  i've kept that promise   i audience member i  you did   i the president i  when you hear these republicans saying that  oh  obama is all about spending and raising taxes  let me tell you  the typical family is paying   less in taxes than when i came into office  that's the truth  that's a fact  so now i want to keep taxes right where they are on the first   of everybody's income  so if your family makes   a year or less like   percent of americans you won't see your income taxes increase by a single dime next year under my plan  not one dime  now  if you're fortunate enough to be in the other   percent  you'll still get a tax cut for your first   worth of income  but after that  we're asking you to contribute a little bit more so we can pay down our deficit and invest in things like education that help our economy grow  i'll make sure the government does its part by cutting away spending we don't need  we've already cut a trillion dollars of spending we didn't need  and we can do more  i want to do another trillion  trillion and a half of cuts  but we've also got to match that with folks like me and governor romney doing our fair share  and all we're asking is that we go back to the same rates that we paid under bill clinton  and you know what  that was a time when our economy created nearly   million new jobs  the biggest budget surplus in history  and millionaires did pretty good too  see  what happens is that when a teacher or a construction worker or a family farmer or a receptionist or a nurse  when they've got a little extra money  what do you do  you end up spending it on things you need  so maybe you haven't got a new car in     years  you go out and buy a car  or maybe the washing machine is broke  and you decide to buy a new washing machine  maybe you go out to a restaurant on a special occasion  maybe you take a vacation once in a while  that money goes into the economy  businesses have more customers  they hire more workers and everybody is better off from top to bottom  i don't believe in top down economics  i believe in middle class out economics  i believe in bottom up economics  that's how you grow an economy  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  there's a difference between me and mr  romney on almost every issue  when the american auto industry was on the brink of collapse  more than   million jobs were on the line  governor romney said let's let detroit go bankrupt  i said let's bet on the american worker  and   years later  the american auto industry is back on top  gm is number one again  now  so i want to make sure that high tech manufacturing jobs are taking root right here in boone  not in china  not in germany  governor romney  he likes to tout his private sector experience  but a lot of that experience is investing in companies that were called  pioneers  of outsourcing  we don't need more outsourcing  we need some insourcing  i want to take away tax breaks i applause i  let's stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give those tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in iowa  right here in the united states of america  that's the choice in this election  my opponent and i disagree when it comes to homegrown energy like wind  wind power is creating new jobs all across iowa  but governor romney says he wants to end the tax credit for wind energy producers  now  america generates more than twice as much electricity from wind than when i took office  and the wind industry i applause i that's right  the wind industry supports about   jobs right here in iowa  without these wind energy tax credits  those jobs are at risk    jobs across the country would be at risk  so my attitude is let's stop giving taxpayer subsidies to oil companies that don't need them and let's invest in clean energy that will put people back to work right here in iowa  that's a choice in this election  i'm running because in   i promised to end the war in iraq  and i did  i promised to go after al qaida and bin laden  and we did  we're putting a timeline to get our troops out of afghanistan and put afghans in charge of their own security  so all of this is possible only because of the extraordinary sacrifice and service of our men and women in uniform  and we are so proud of them  now  we've got to do right by them  we've got to make sure that we're serving our veterans as well as they've served us  that's why we've put more money into the va  making sure that folks are getting the benefits that they have earned  whether it's the wounds that are seen or the wounds that are unseen  but it also means that after a decade of war  we need to do some nation building here at home so that all our men and women in uniform are coming home to good paying jobs  that's why i've said let's take half the money that we were spending on war and let's put folks back to work right here in the united states of america  let's put them back to work rebuilding schools and rebuilding roads and rebuilding bridges  and let's create a veterans jobs corps to help hire veterans to become cops and firefighters in communities that need them the most  that's the america we want to build  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  i'm running because i want to make sure that once again america has the best education system in the world  so i want to help our schools hire and reward the best teachers  especially in math and science  i want to give   million more americans a chance to go to community colleges to get trained for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  and we have a plan to push colleges and universities to bring down their cost of tuition  because young people  they can't be burdened with tens of thousands of dollars' worth of debt when they go to school  a higher education isn't a luxury anymore  it is an economic necessity in the  st century  and we are going to help them get the education that they need  across the board  governor romney and i just see the world differently  when it comes to housing  i want to make sure that everybody who hasn't yet taken advantage of these historically low interest rates has a chance to refinance their homes  it can save folks up to   governor romney's plan  he said just let the housing market bottom out  that's not a solution  that's part of the problem  he has got a different view than i do in terms of how we move this country forward  when it comes to health care  i guess he used to agree with me because he had the same health care plan that i did in massachusetts  and by the way  that plan is working pretty good  now  he says he wants to kill obamacare  well  first of all  i don't mind it being called obamacare because  it's true  i do care  that's why i passed the bill  i do care  i care about folks who have preexisting conditions and couldn't get insurance  that's why we passed the bill  i care about the   million young people who can now stay on their parent's plan because of this bill  i care about the seniors who were paying too much for their prescription drugs  we're closing the doughnut hole because of this bill and lowering their prescription drug costs  so i don't believe that you should go broke when you get sick in this country  and i'll work with anybody who wants to continue to improve our health care system  but the supreme court has spoken  the law is here to stay  we're not spending the next   years refighting that battle  we're moving forward  we're not going backwards  that's a choice in this election  so  boone  all these things whether it's bringing manufacturing jobs back  putting folks back to work in construction  protecting your health care  making sure our kids are getting the best education possible and they can afford to go to college all these things that make up that american dream  that make up a middle class life  they all tie together  they're central to that idea that made this country great  the promise that if you work hard  you get ahead  that everybody has a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules  it's the promise that our parents and our grandparents passed down to us  that's the promise that allowed me the child of a single mom to become president of the united states  it's the promise that allowed michelle  whose dad was a blue collar worker and her mom was a secretary  to become the first lady  it's the promise that all of you have seen in your own lives  and now it's time for us to pass that down to our kids and our grandkids  so  over the next   months  the other side will spend more money than you have ever seen running the same ad over and over again  basically  which says  the economy is not where it should be and it's obama's fault  they just repeat it over and over again  they've got different variations  but it's all the same theme   i audience member i  they're not right   i the president i  and well  they're not constrained by the facts  in terms of these ads that they run  they'll just make stuff up  and that may be a plan to win the election  but the reason they've got to do that is because they know they don't have a plan to create jobs  they don't have a plan to grow the economy  they don't have a plan to revive the middle class  what they're selling  you're not buying  that's why they don't talk about it  i've got that plan  and we can make it work  but i'm going to need your help  i've got to make sure everybody here is registered to vote  i've got to make sure everybody is getting their friends and their neighbors  their family members to register to vote  you can get a voter registration form online  you go to gottaregister com  that's  gotta g o t t a  gottaregister com  but if you guys get involved  we can't lose  i've been outspent before and i've been counted out before  but the reason i love this state is because all of you gave me a chance  i had a chance to talk to you and meet you and share stories with you  and i used to say back in   that i'm not a perfect man and i won't be a perfect president  but i told you i'd always tell you what i thought  always tell you where i stood  and i'd fight every single day as hard as i knew how for you  and the reason is because i see myself in you  when i see your grandparents  i see my grandparents  and when i see your kids  i see malia and sasha  and we know what it's like to work and to fight hard to get ahead  and i want everybody in america to have that same chance that i had  because we have come too far to turn back now  iowa  we've got too many good jobs to create  we've got too many great teachers to hire  we've got too many schools to rebuild  we've got too many students who need to get a college education  we've got too many wind farms to build  we've got more troops we've got to bring back home  we've got to open up more doors to opportunity  and if you'll stand with me and work with me and organize with me and knock on doors with me  boone  i promise you  we will win iowa and we will win this election  and we'll remind the world why this is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello nevada  hello  las vegas  oh  it is good to be back in nevada   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  and i want to thank our host  canyon springs high school  go pioneers   i applause i  go pioneers  a couple of people i want to acknowledge  first of all  can everybody please give a big round of applause to claritssa for the great introduction and the great job she's doing  i want to acknowledge u s  senate candidate  your current congresswoman shelley berkley is in the house  we also have congressional candidates steven horsford and john oceguera  and all of you are here  and i'm really excited  now  first of all  if you've got a seat  feel free to take a seat  if you don't have a seat  make sure you bend your knees while you're standing there  we don't want you fainting  usually  in these rallies  one or two people kind of drop off right in the middle   i laughter i  so i want to make sure everybody   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  thank you  i love you back  now  the first thing i want to say is  i didn't know it rains in las vegas   i laughter i  i have never seen it raining here  and we got a nice little rain out there  so that's good  that kind of keeps the plants alive and cools things off a little bit  this is a busy time of year  sports teams are already practicing  teachers are finishing up and fine tuning their lesson plans  and next week  here in clark county  classes begin  and   i at this point  an audience member screamed i   i the president i  good  this young lady is very excited about going to school   i laughter i  and i want all the young people to feel that same kind of excitement  and although  i have to say  as a father  i know that not every student is always as excited as this young lady about school starting back up again  even though their parents are always very excited   i laughter i  get them back in school  but i've come to canyon springs high school today because we all understand there is nothing more important to our country's future than the education we give our children   i applause i  nothing more important  it is central to the very idea of america  that if you're willing to study hard and you're willing to work hard  no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you came from  no matter what your last name is  here in america you can make it if you try  now  i'm a big believer that education starts at home  it starts with parents who are reading to their kids and turning off the tv sometimes  instilling a lifelong love of learning  you can't replace that kind of attitude that you get at home  and so parents have to make sure that they're staying on top of their kids' educations  it also means  students  you've got to have a lifelong love of learning  sometimes when i'm talking to young people  i try to explain to them  you know what  an education is not something you receive passively  we don't just tip your head over and pour education in your ear   i laughter i  you've got to want it  you've got to be engaged and curious and interested and be willing to ask questions and push yourself  and especially when subjects are hard  you've got to be willing to work at it  it doesn't come easy  that's the nature of a good education  and that will last you your whole life   i applause i  that will last you your whole life  but as important as parents are  as important as the attitudes of students are  what happens at schools like this will shape the future of the vast majority of our kids  what happens in the classroom matters  and that begins with the person at the front of the classroom  for weeks now  teachers like claritssa across the country have been working behind the scenes  they've been preparing their classrooms  they've been decorating bulletin boards  they've been digging into their own pockets all too often to pay for school supplies  i know because my sister is a teacher  and i know how much effort they put into this  they don't ask for a lot of recognition  they're certainly not going into teaching for the money   i laughter i  they do it because they care about children  they care about their future  i was just meeting with another teacher backstage who said teaching is the closest you can get to immortality  and in fact  in a meeting that i had with teachers  i had a chance to meet with one teacher who was an adviser to claritssa when she was a student  so he's had the opportunity to see his own student now doing what he's been doing for   years  that's what satisfaction that must give you  the right teacher can change a child's life forever  and look  i know this from personal experience  when i was in fifth grade  i had a teacher named mabel hefty  that was her name  and she was a great teacher  she was full of curiosity and she was full of enthusiasm  and most importantly  she went that extra mile  fifth grade can be a tough time for a kid  and i was different and had a funny name  and i had just come back from living a few years overseas with my mom and wasn't sure how i'd fit in  and she noticed that  ms  hefty  and she took me under her wing  and she made me feel like i had something to say and that i had some talent  and she wasn't too obvious about it  but she made sure that during this transition year  i was able to steady myself and start focusing on my work  i still remember her all these years later  she's passed away now  but i still remember her  i'm only standing here as president because i had a bunch of great teachers like ms  hefty  teachers matter  a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by more than a quarter million dollars  a great teacher can change the trajectory of a child's life  they can offer an escape from poverty to a child who dreams beyond his or her circumstances  sometimes a teacher can fill in where the parent isn't always there  so they're on the front lines of our country's future  but here's the thing  this year  fewer teachers are going back to school  since june of   even as we've created millions of new jobs in the private sector  we've lost more than   teachers  aides  and staff in our schools  largely because of budget cuts at the state and local levels  think about what that means for our kids  claritssa mentioned it  crowded classrooms  canceled programs for preschoolers  less learning time  here in clark county  the average class size was already the largest in the country last year  this year  it's getting even bigger  cutting back on teachers is the last thing we should be doing as a country   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  we should be hiring more teachers  especially in areas like math and science where we need to be at the cutting edge  if we want america to lead in the  st century  we've got to give all our children the best education possible from the day they start in preschool to the day they start their career because other countries are racing  they are doing everything they can to out educate us because they know that means they'll be able to out compete us  they know that new businesses and new industries will take root and create jobs wherever the best educated  most highly skilled workers are   i audience member i   i inaudible i   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  so that young man probably needed a good teacher  we all need it  so businesses are going to locate where they've got the best workers  the best educated  the most highly skilled workers  and i want that place to be nevada  i want that place to be clark county  i want that place to be the united states of america  and that's why even as we face the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  i've fought to keep teachers in the classroom  the actions that we took during the first   years of my administration helped save the jobs of   educators  that made a difference for our kids  it made a difference in our communities  part of the jobs bill that i sent to the new congress last september would have helped states like nevada prevent further layoffs  would allow them to rehire teachers who have lost their jobs  but republicans in congress led   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  no  no  don't boo  vote  that's right  vote  the republicans in congress  led by congressman ryan  joined together to block the bill that would have helped states hire and retain more teachers  and as a result  tens of thousands of teachers are not coming back to school this fall  now  not only is that unfair to our kids  it's foolish for our future  now  my opponent in this election doesn't seem to understand this  governor romney says we've got enough teachers  we don't need anymore  the way he talks about them  it seems as if he thinks these are a bunch of nameless government bureaucrats that we need to cut back on those are his words  and his economic plan certainly would do that  the plan governor romney has put forward would cut america's investment in education by nearly   percent   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and here's the thing  he's not making these cuts because he wants to create jobs or pay down the deficit  he's doing it to pay for a new   trillion tax cut that's weighted towards the wealthiest americans   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  so i've got a question for governor romney  how many teachers' jobs are worth another tax cut for millionaires and billionaires  how many kids in head start are worth a tax cut for somebody like me who doesn't need it  how many grants and loans for college students are worth a tax cut for governor romney  who certainly doesn't need it  we are a better country than one that short changes the next generation just so we can shower tax cuts on folks who are already doing really well  we're a better country than one that pulls the rug out from under young people working so hard to make it just to give more to folks who've already got a lot  that's not who we are  that's not how we built the greatest economy and the strongest middle class in the world  that's not a plan for our future  that's not where i want to take this country  that's why i'm running for reelection as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  governor romney has made his time as an investor the basis for his candidacy  and his economic plan makes clear he doesn't think our children's education is worth investing in  i do  and that's the choice this november  when a teacher in west philadelphia  somebody on the front lines of our education system  told governor romney that having too many kids in his class made it harder for him to do his job  governor romney told him that class sizes don't matter  now  there are a lot of studies that say that class sizes do matter  especially in the early grades  but more importantly  why wouldn't we be listening to the teachers who are actually in the classroom  have you ever met a teacher who said  you know what  i have too few kids in my class  i want a lot more kids   i laughter i  would any parent want their kids to go to a school with much bigger class sizes  claritssa was telling me that in the first couple of weeks of school  she might have   students in a class  they don't have enough desks  so they've got some kids sitting on the floor getting assignments  now  eventually  the school district tries to work to level things out  but she says even at that point  she may have   anybody ever try to be with     or  year olds   i laughter i  and some of them may not be reading at grade level  some of them  english may be a second language  imagine how difficult that is  so instead of listening to teachers or working with teachers  governor romney said the only reason he would keep the department of education around is to push back against teachers  he thinks that teachers need to have somebody policing them and checking them and that's the main purpose of the department of education  that's like saying you keep the department of agriculture around so you can push around farmers   i laughter i  and the sad thing is  education should not be a democratic or a republican issue  it's an american issue  it's about what's best for our kids  and i haven't just talked the talk  i've walked the walk on this  over the past   years  we've broken through the traditional stalemate that used to exist between the left and the right  between conservatives and liberals  we launched a national competition to improve all our schools  we put more money into it  but we also demanded reform  we want teachers to be paid better and treated like the professionals that they are  but we're also demanding more accountability  including the ability of school districts to replace teachers that aren't cutting it  for less than   percent of what our nation spends on education each year  almost every state has now agreed to raise standards for teaching and learning  and that's the first time it's happened in a generation  and then  we've worked with democrats and republicans to fix no child left behind  so here in nevada  a waiver has been granted because we want high standards  but we don't want teachers teaching to the test  we told governors and their states that if you're willing to set higher  more honest standards for our kids  we're going to give you more flexibility to meet them  because what works best in new york might not work as well in nevada and vice versa  we know that when students aren't allowed to walk away from their education  more of them walk on that stage to get their diplomas  and that's why i've called on every state to require that their students stay in high school until they graduate or turn   and when kids do graduate  the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college  and that's why we've helped over   million more students afford a college education with grants that go farther than before  we fought to make sure the interest rate on federal student loans didn't go up over the summer  we won that fight  we stood up to special interests and fixed a student loan system that gave tens of billions of taxpayer dollars to big banks  and we used that money to double grant aid to students  governor romney is on the wrong side of each of these issues  his plan would cut aid to   million students  turn student loans back over to big banks  wasting billions of dollars of taxpayer money  when he was asked  well  what are you going to do about the rising cost of tuition he was asked this by a student he just said  well  you need to go borrow money from your parents   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  that's not a plan  that's the choice in this election  so let me just say this  over the next   months it's actually less than   months  it's less than   weeks  not that i'm counting  but i laughter i we will see the other side spend more money than we've ever seen on ads  and these aren't  like  positive ads where they're putting out their plan  because they don't really have a plan  and the plan they've got won't work   i laughter i  so what they'll do is they will run these ads over and over again just saying the economy is not where it should be and it's all obama's fault  and that's the only argument they have because they know their economic plan is not popular  they know that gutting education to pay for massive new tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires  that's not going to be popular among voters  so they're counting on the fact that  after watching so many of these ads every day  you will get so discouraged that you'll decide your vote doesn't matter  you'll decide you can't compete with some rich guy writing a   million check  but  vegas  i'm counting on something different  claritssa is counting on something different  the students at this school are counting on something different  we need your help  we need you  we need you to register to vote  we've got staff and volunteers who can help you do that on your way out today  they'll grab you if you're not registered  here in nevada you can register online  you can go to the web site gottaregister com  now  that's  gotta  g o t t a i laughter i  for the teachers in the audience  i know that's not how you're supposed to spell it  but that's how it is   gotta   i laughter i  so that means you can grab your friends  grab your neighbors  grab your aunt  grab your uncle  cousins  and you can register you can help them get registered online  but here's the thing  we've come too far to turn back now  we've been through a tough   years  and nevada has been through tougher times than most states  but the fact is that everything i've done has been focused on how we rebuild that strong middle class  how we make sure everybody is getting a fair shot  everybody is doing their fair share  everybody is playing by the same set of rules  that's how we saved an auto industry  that's how we've seen   million jobs created  that's how we ended the war in iraq  that's how we are creating jobs in clean energy  we've got more work to do  we've got more good teachers to hire  we've got more good schools to build  we've got more young people to send to college  we've got more good jobs to create  we've got more solar panels we've got to create  we've got more troops we've got to bring home  we've got more veterans we've got to help  we've got more doors of opportunity we've got to open up to every single american  that's why i'm asking for a second term  and if you're willing to stand with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls with me  this november  we will win nevada  we will win this election  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  hawkeyes  oh  it's good to be back at the university of iowa  a couple of people i want to mention  first of all  your outstanding congressman dave loebsack is here  your mayor  matt hayek  is here  and somebody who's been with me since we started our first road trip here in iowa back in   your attorney general  tom miller is in the house  and all of you are here  it is wonderful to be here  and some of you guys know i've just come from charlotte  north carolina  where we had an outstanding convention  folks down there could not have been more welcoming  michelle what can i say she was amazing  president clinton made the case the way only he can  somebody sent around a tweet saying  you need to appoint him secretary of explaining stuff   i laughter i  so i thought that was a pretty good idea  and then joe biden was all fired up  he was ready to go  and then last night i did my best to lay out the stakes in this election  which could not be higher  now  you've seen both sides make their argument  and you know now what a fundamental choice we have ahead of us  i honestly believe this is the clearest choice that we've had in my lifetime  because it's not just a choice between two candidates  it's not just a choice between two parties  it's a choice between two fundamentally different visions of our future  where america goes  ours is a fight to build that basic bargain again that created the greatest  largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known  the basic bargain that says if you work hard it will pay off  that responsibility will be rewarded  that everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody plays by the same set of rules  from main street to wall street to washington  dc  and restoring that basic bargain is why i got into public service in the first place  i started my career working in the shadow of steel mills where folks had been laid off as jobs were being shifted overseas  and for the last decade  we've seen too many families here in iowa and all across the country struggling with costs that keep rising even when paychecks don't  people racking up more debt  using credit cards  home equity loans just to make the mortgage or pay tuition or put gas in the car or put food on the table  and all that collapsed in the great recession  where millions of innocent americans lost their jobs and their homes and their life savings  and we have been fighting to recover ever since from that devastation  now  our friends at the republican convention  they liked to talk about everything they think is wrong with america  but they didn't have much to say about what they'd do to make it right  they want your vote  but they don't want you to know their plan because they know you wouldn't buy it  because we tried it  all they've got to offer is the same prescription they've been offering for   years  tax cuts  tax cuts  tax cuts  gut a few regulations here and there  oh  and more tax cuts   i laughter i  tax cuts when times are good  tax cuts when times are bad  tax cuts to help you lose a few pounds   i laughter i  tax cuts to improve your love life   i laughter i  whatever the issue  they've got one answer  now  iowa  i've cut taxes for folks who need it  middle class families  small business owners  when i was campaigning in iowa back in     i said we're going to cut taxes for middle class families  and that's what we've done  the average family has seen their tax burden go down   since i've become president  i kept that promise  but i don't know about you  i don't believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs back to our shores or pay down our deficit  i sure don't think firing teachers or kicking students off of financial aid is somehow going to grow our economy or help us compete with scientists and engineers that are coming out of china  i don't know about you  but after all we've been through  after the crisis we went through in     i don't think that rolling back regulations on wall street are somehow going to help the small businesswoman in iowa city expand or the laid off construction worker in des moines keep his home  we have been there  we have tried that  we are not going back  we are moving forward  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  i won't pretend i told you last night  i will not pretend that the path i'm offering is quick or easy  anybody who says it is  they're not telling you the truth  i've never said it was going to be quick and easy  what i said was  we can move forward  we can make progress  we can make things better  we can strengthen our middle class  we can rebuild a strong foundation for our economy  as bill clinton reminded us on wednesday night  it is going to take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up for decades  we know that  today we learned that after losing   jobs a month when i took office  businesses added jobs for the  th month in a row  we've added more than   million jobs  but we know that that's not good enough  we can do better  we need to create jobs even faster  we need to fill the hole left by this recession  we need to come out of this crisis stronger than when we went in  i don't want to just get back to where we were in   i want us to do even better  there is a lot more that we can do  and when congress gets back to town next week you don't need to call dave loebsack  he's already on the program but you can tell some of these other congressmen to give middle class families and small businesses the confidence they need by telling them that their taxes will not go up next year  everybody agrees we shouldn't raise taxes on the middle class  so let's get that done  and let's get it done now  what's the hold up  what's the wait  and by the way  we could create a million additional new jobs if this congress would pass the jobs bill i sent them a year ago  jobs for teachers and construction workers and folks who have been out there looking for work for a long time  we can do that  but i need your help  iowa  i need your voices   i audience members i  you got it   i laughter i   i the president i  say  i want to make this point  at our convention  i wasn't just asking for your vote  i was asking us to rally around an achievable set of goals for our country  goals in manufacturing and energy and education and national security and defense  real  concrete goals that will lead to new jobs and more opportunity and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation  that's what we can do in the next   years  that's why i'm running for a second term  now  for those of you who missed it last night  let me just repeat what i want us to do  first  i've got a plan to export more products around the world and outsource fewer jobs around the world  so the good news is after a decade of decline  america has created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last   years  we reinvented the dying auto industry  it's now back on top of the world  so we need to build on that progress  and you've got a choice  you can go along with the other folks and give more tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  or we can start rewarding companies that are investing in new plants and equipment and training new workers and creating new jobs right here in the united states of america  we can help big factories and small businesses double their exports  we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  you can make that happen  but i'm going to need your help  second  i've got a plan to control more of our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that will save you money and it will help our environment  and we've doubled the use of renewable energy  especially here in iowa  we've got thousands of americans who have jobs today building wind turbines and long lasting batteries  and today  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades  think about that  so now you've got a choice  between the other guys  who want to reverse on that progress  or those of us who want to build on it  see  unlike my opponent  i will not let oil companies write this country's energy plan  i'm not going to let them collect another   billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers  we've got a better path  i want to keep investing in wind and solar  clean coal technology  farmers and scientists harnessing new biofuels to power our cars and trucks  i want to put construction workers back to work building homes and factories that waste less energy  and retrofit buildings so that they're using less energy  and we can develop a hundred years' supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet and do it in an environmentally sound way  and if you choose this path  we can cut our oil imports by half in   and support more than   new jobs in natural gas alone  but i'm going to need you to keep moving forward on this energy agenda  we can't go backwards   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  this is great  but you haven't even heard the third thing yet   i laughter i  number three  i've got a plan to give more americans like you the chance to gain the skills they need to compete  education was the gateway for opportunity for me  it was the gateway for opportunity for michelle  all of you who are students here understand this is the ticket to a middle class life  so what we've done over the last   years  for the first time in a generation  nearly every state has answered our call to raise standards for teaching and learning  some of the worst schools in the country have made real gains in math and reading  millions of students maybe some of you are paying less for college today because we finally took on a system that was wasting billions of dollars on banks and lenders  we cut out the middleman  let's give those loans directly to students  the money we saved allowed us to help millions of more students and keep student loans and grants out there for folks  so now you've got a choice  you can go with the other folks' plan   i audience members i  no   i the president   i and gut education  or we can decide that here in the united states of america  nobody should have their dreams set aside because of a crowded classroom or a crumbling school  no family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money  no company should have to look for workers in china because they couldn't find the right skills here at home  that's not the future for america  we've got to have the best education system in the world  we know how to do it  we've just got to stay with it  so help me recruit   new math and science teachers in the next   years  let's improve early childhood education  let's give   million workers the chance to get the skills they need at local community colleges  and let's help keep tuition low at colleges and universities all across the country  because you guys deserve to have the chance to succeed  that's what this election is about  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience member i  we love you  obama   i the president i  i love you back  but let me tell you the fourth thing  you'll love me even more   i laughter i  fourth  my plan would reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class  independent analysis has shown that my plan would cut deficits by   trillion  and i've already worked with the republicans in congress to cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending  because those of us who care about what government can do to help people give them a ladder up  we've got to make sure that the money is well spent  and some programs aren't working  we've got to get rid of them  we've got to make sure that government is lean and efficient and providing good service to the american people  so i'm willing to do more  but i want to make sure that we also reform our tax code so that it's simple and fair and so that we ask the wealthiest households in america to pay higher incomes or higher taxes on incomes over   now  that means that if you make more than   you're still getting a tax break on the first   it just means that after you make additional money  you're paying the same rate we paid when bill clinton was president  the same rate we had when our economy created nearly   million new jobs  we had the biggest surplus in history  and we created a whole lot of millionaires to boot  that makes sense for america  now  the other side since everything is cured by a tax cut  especially for wealthy americans so far they've balked  they've refused my offer to work with them on this  but this week  president clinton pointed out that the single biggest missing from my opponent's plan is arithmetic   i laughter i  it doesn't add up  governor romney and his allies in congress tell us that somehow we can lower our deficits they say that the deficit is the most important thing  they say this is vital for our future  but when you ask them  all right  what's your plan  they say  well  we're first going to start by taking   trillion out of the economy and giving it to folks like me and mr  romney taking it out of treasury  rather and giving it to me and mr  romney  and then  somehow  it's all going to create prosperity for the rest of you  well  you do the math  if you want to lower the deficit  but we're spending   trillion on tax cuts for folks who don't need it and weren't even asking for it  how is that going to work  the fact is the numbers in mr  romney's plan don't add up to lower deficits  and by the way  they don't add up to more jobs either  because the economists have actually said that my opponent's plan would make the recovery slower  not faster  so i'm not going along with that plan  i refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children out of head start programs or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans who are poor or elderly or disabled  just so those with the most can pay less  and i will never turn medicare into a voucher system  because no american should have to spend their golden years  after years of labor  at the mercy of insurance companies  they should retire with the care and the dignity that they have earned  we can strengthen and reform medicare for the long haul  but we'll do it by reducing the costs of health care  not by just dumping the costs on seniors  asking them to pay thousands of dollars more  and we're going to keep the promise of social security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it  not by turning it over to wall street  now  let me say rebuilding this economy is essential  that's priority number one  but our prosperity at home is linked to policies abroad  so   years ago i promised we'd end the war in iraq  we did  i said we'd wind down the war in afghanistan  we are  and as a new tower rises above the new york skyline  al qaida is on the path to defeat  and bin laden is dead  so long as i'm commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world's ever known  and when our troops take off their uniform  we will serve them as well as they've served us  because no american who's fought for us should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads or the care that they've earned when the come home  so just like there's a choice on domestic policy  there's a choice when it comes to foreign affairs  my opponent said it was  tragic  to end the war in iraq   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote   i laughter i  he won't tell us how he'll end the war in afghanistan  and i have  and i will  and while my opponent would spend more money on military programs that the joint chiefs say we don't need  won't make us safer  don't want  i'm going to use that money that we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and to put more people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways  because after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building here at home  iowa  that's what we need to focus on  this is the choice we now face  this is what the election comes down to  i said yesterday  over and over again  we've been told by our opponents that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way to go  that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  if you can't afford health insurance  their theory is  i hope you don't get sick  if companies are releasing toxic pollution into the air  well  that's just the price of progress  that's their theory  if you can't afford to start a business or go to college  well  take my opponent's advice and borrow money from your parents i laughter i  that's his theory  you know what  that's not who we are  that's not what this country is about  when i look at all these young people here  i'm reminded of what is essential about this country  as americans  we insist on personal responsibility  we insist on individual initiative  everybody here knows we're not entitled to success  we have to earn it  and we honor entrepreneurs and businesspeople  strivers  the dreamers  the risk takers who are the driving force behind our free enterprise system  and we believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of growth and prosperity that the world has ever known  but we also believe that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations  we understand that as citizens  america is not just about what can be done for us  it's about what can be done by us  together  as one nation and as one people  and nobody understands that better than the people of iowa  because the election   years ago wasn't about me  it was about you  the change that started here in iowa  the change that started here in iowa city  you were the change  you're the reason that there's some little girl out there with a heart disorder who is now going to get surgery that she needs because an insurance company can't limit her coverage  you did that  you're the reason that students right here at the university of iowa are going to be able to graduate college with the security of knowing that you can stay on your parent's health insurance plan  you did that  you're the reason there's a young teacher in boone  who has a little more time to pay back her college loans so that she can start her life doing what she loves without being buried by debt  you made that possible  you're the reason a young immigrant  who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag  will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home  you're the reason why we ended  don't ask  don't tell  you're the reason why thousands of families have been willing have been able to say to their loved ones who served us so bravely   welcome home  you're the reason   i applause i  you're the reason  and so if you turn back now  if you buy into the cynicism that you hear all the time that says somehow the change we fought isn't possible  well then  of course  change won't happen  if you stop  change won't happen  you are what brings it about  if you give up on the idea that your voice makes a difference  then other voices fill the void  the special interests  the lobbyists  the folks who write   million checks to run all those negative ads  the people who are trying to make it harder for you to vote  the politicians who want to decide who you can marry or want to control health care choices that women should be making for themselves  you'll leave it up to them to make decisions  only you can make sure that doesn't happen  when you see that sign that says  forward  we don't go forward without you  only you have that power  and i'm depending on you to use that power  i'm asking you to make sure you don't give up that power  every young people here  i need you to register to vote  if you're not registered  go on gottaregister com  that's g o t t a  sorry  english teachers  this is not  got to  it's  gotta  gottaregister com  if you need to know how to vote  including early vote here in iowa  go to gottavote com  i'm asking you not only to register and vote  i need you to go after your friends  talk to your parents  talk to your cousins  aunts  uncles  cousins  whoever you got  iowa  i need you to make some phone calls with me  i need you to knock on some doors with me  i need you to tell your friends and your neighbors and your coworkers what's at stake in this election  and if you do  we will finish what we started  if you use the power that you have  we will create more good jobs in america  we'll generate more homegrown energy in america  we'll hire more good teachers in america  and we will send more young people to college right here in america  we'll bring our troops home  and we'll take care of more of our veterans  and we'll open up more doors of opportunity to every american who's willing to work hard to walk through them  that's what we need  we will win johnson county  we will win iowa  we will finish what we started in   and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  let's get to work  let's move forward "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  everybody  thank you so much  thank you  it is great to be here  thank you  all right  everybody have a seat  have a seat   i audience member i  i love you   i the president i  i love you back  it is good to be in milwaukee  first of all  it's just good to be this close to my house   i laughter i  take it straight down an hour and a half  and i'm home  but although i got to say that i forgot that late september  it already starts getting a little chilly around here   i laughter i  i've been getting a little spoiled down in dc it's still   degrees down there  but it's also great to be here because i see a lot of friends who i haven't seen for a long time first of all  your outstanding mayor  tom barrett  and then  to have maybe the best baseball player of all time introduce you that's not bad either hank aaron in the house  and it's great to see all of you   i audience member i  thank you   i the president i  backstage is my campaign manager  jim messina  he drove up from chicago  and he's been telling me a story he told me a story about he was at some event i wasn't at it but he saw this young couple  and they had this adorable  year old boy  and they were talking  and the parents were very proud that the  year old already knew me  and there was a picture up there  and they said   who's that  and the  year old says   that's barack obama  and they said   so what does barack obama do  and sammy  the young boy  he thinks for a second  and he says   he approves this message   i laughter i  he approves this message  so that's what i do   i laughter i  i approve this message  it is election season  and the message i approve is important because in the coming weeks  folks here in wisconsin and all across the country are going to have a very big decision to make not just between two candidates or two political parties  but two fundamentally different paths for america  two different visions for our future  my opponent  he believes in top down economics  thinks that if you spend another   trillion on a tax cut skewed towards the wealthy that prosperity will rain down on everybody else   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no hissing or booing just voting  that's what we need   i laughter i  voting  but the idea is you do that  maybe get rid of some regulations  deficit will disappear  we'll all live happily ever after  now  the problem  of course  is we just tried this  we tried it during the last decade  it didn't work then  top down economics never works  the country doesn't succeed when just those at the very top are doing well  we succeed when the middle class gets bigger  when it feels greater security  when everybody has got a chance to climb into that middle class and everybody has a chance to live up to their god given potential  we can't get very far if we're just writing off half the country as a bunch of victims  or presume that somehow they want to be dependent on government or don't want to take responsibility for their own lives  because wherever i travel  folks are working hard  folks understand everybody has got to take initiative  people understand that we're all responsible for ourselves  but people also understand that we've got obligations to each other  when i go and meet students who are trying to work through college  or single moms putting in overtime to give their child a better future  or senior citizens who  after a lifetime of labor  are looking forward to a secure retirement  or veterans who have served this country and those in uniform who are fighting to defend our freedom right now they're not victims  and they sure do take a lot of responsibility  and we don't believe anybody is entitled to success or that government can help people who don't want to help themselves  but we do believe in something called opportunity  we believe in this country hard work should pay off  and responsibility should be rewarded  and everybody should have a fair shot  and everybody should do their fair share  and everybody should play by the same rules  that's the country we believe in  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  now  i'm not suggesting this is going to be easy  we just went through the worst recession since the great depression  we've got big challenges and some of those challenges have built up over decades  but wherever i travel  one of the things i try to communicate is how much confidence i have in this country  because we are americans  and we've got so many things going for us  we've got the best workers in the world  and the best business people in the world  we've got the best universities  the best colleges  the best researchers and scientists  we have the most diverse population  full of innovators and risk takers  there's not a country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states of america  and that's why people continue to travel here from all across the globe in search of opportunity  so we've got what it takes to succeed  but what's preventing us from realizing all that potential in part is the politics we've been seeing in washington  and part of what this election is about is giving the american people a voice to break the deadlock and break the gridlock  and chart a course that may be harder but leads to a better place  what i'm offering is a practical  specific plan to create jobs and grow the middle class  rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation  and that means exporting more products and outsourcing fewer jobs  it starts there  when there were those who said  let's  let detroit go bankrupt  i said  a million jobs are at stake  we're not going to do that  an iconic american industry is at stake  and     years later  the american auto industry has come roaring back  we've seen half a million new jobs in manufacturing  the fastest pace since the  s  and so the choice now is  do we reverse that progress or do we move forward   i audience members i  forward   i the president i  right answer  instead of giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  we want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing in new plants and equipment and workers right here in milwaukee  right here in wisconsin  right here in the united states of america  we want to double exports  we could create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years if we make the right choice in this election  i want us to control more of our own energy  after   years of inaction  we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars  we have doubled the production of clean energy  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas as a consequence of the work that we've done  we've invested in wind and solar  and thousands of jobs have been created all across america in these industries  building wind turbines and long lasting batteries  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than it's been in nearly two decades  and now you've got a choice  do you build on that progress  moving forward  or do we reverse it  because that's what my opponent is proposing  i've got a different vision than he does  because i'm not going to let oil companies write our energy policy  i don't want to keep giving them a   billion subsidy when they're making record profits  i want to use that money to invest in wind and solar and clean coal technology  and a lot of farmers and scientists to harness new biofuels to power our cars and trucks  put construction workers back to work retrofitting homes and buildings and schools and hospitals to make them more energy efficient  develop a nearly  year supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet  and if we do those things  our plan will cut in half by   our oil imports and create hundreds of thousands of jobs to boot  that's how we move forward  i want americans to have the best education system in the world  it was the gateway of opportunity for me and for michelle and for many of you  and so today  because of the work that we've done over the last four years  millions of students are able to go to college because we have taken billions of dollars that were being wasted in the student loan program and made sure that that money was going directly to students  we've seen reforms in   of the   states as a consequence of our race to the top initiative  so we're making progress  now we've got a choice  because the other side wants to gut our investment in education to pay for tax breaks for wealthy individuals  and i've got a different vision  because i don't think there's any child that should be deferring their dreams because of an overcrowded classroom or outdated textbooks  i don't think there should be any family who gets a college acceptance letter and has to say  no  we can't do it because we can't afford it  and there shouldn't be a company in america that ends up looking in china for the workers they need because they can't find them right here in the united states of america  so i'm going to need your help to hire   new math and science teachers  and improve early childhood education  and give   million more workers the skills they need to go to community colleges to train for the jobs that are out there right now  and to work with colleges and universities to cut the growth in tuition  we can meet those goals  we can choose that future  but that's what's at stake over the next several weeks in this election  we need to reduce our deficit  but we need to do it right  i've put forward a   billion a   trillion deficit reduction package without sticking it to the middle class  and i've already worked with republicans to cut a trillion in spending  i'm willing to do more  i'm willing to work with them  we need a tax code that is fair and simple  but we're not just going to cut our way to prosperity  my opponent  his basic proposal is we give a   trillion tax cut so that somebody making   million a year would get a   tax break  and every independent analyst who's looked at it says the only way you pay for that is to ask middle class families to pay even more in taxes than they're doing right now  now  i've just got a different vision  what i've said is folks who can afford it like me can pay a little more  we can keep taxes low for your first   worth of income  but after that we can go back to the rates that bill clinton had in place when he was president  when we created   million new jobs and went from deficit to surplus  and we created a whole lot of millionaires to boot  because what happens is when middle class families are doing well  business has more customers  they make more profits  they hire more workers  and we're on a virtuous path  my opponent's plan  the math just doesn't add up  bill clinton pointed that out you need some arithmetic to present a budget and to reduce the deficit  and you can't reduce a deficit if you're spending trillions of dollars more on tax cuts for folks who don't need them and weren't even asking for them  and that's the reason they haven't been able to explain how it adds up because it doesn't add up  i've been very clear  one thing i'm not going to do  i am not going to slash investments in education and make young people pay more for college just to pay for a tax cut for millionaires and billionaires  i'm not going to kick them off of head start  i'm not going to shortchange our investment in basic research that could help us find cures for alzheimer's and cancer  we're not going to turn medicare into a voucher program in order to pay for tax cuts for the very wealthy  we're not going to eliminate health care for millions of poor and elderly and disabled americans  when it comes to medicare  we need to reduce health care costs we don't need to shift them onto seniors  asking them to pay thousands of dollars more  and that's what the voucher program that governor romney and mr  ryan are proposing  social security we need to strengthen  but we don't need to turn it over to wall street  and what we also understand is that our prosperity at home is connected to our policies abroad  and so   years ago i promised many of you that i'd end the war in iraq and we did  i said we'd wind down the war in afghanistan and we are  and as a new tower rises in new york  we have gone after al qaida and we got bin laden  but as we were reminded this past week  this is a world still full of serious threats  we're going to have to work to prevent iran from getting a nuclear weapon  we're going to have to make sure that not only our diplomatic posts are safe  but we go after folks who threaten or try to kill americans  and that's why as long as i'm commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  and when our troops come home  we'll make sure we're serving them as well as they've served us because if you fought for this country you shouldn't have to fight for a job when you come home  my opponent  he's got a different view  he said ending the war in iraq the way we did was  tragic doesn't have a plan to wind down the war in afghanistan  and i've just got a different perspective  i think after a decade of war  it's time for us to do some nation building here at home  let's put americans back to work  using the savings that we obtain  to rebuild our roads and our bridges and our schools  and lay broadband lines into rural communities  let's do some nation building right here  so that's the choice we face  that's what the election is coming down to  the other side  they keep on saying that tax cuts and fewer regulations is the only way  they say that because government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  we've got a different view  we don't believe in  you're on your own  economics  what these guys basically argue  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if a company is polluting the air your children breathe  that's the price of progress  if you can't afford to go to college  borrow some money from your parents   i laughter i  that's not who we are  we don't think government can solve every problem  but it's not the source of every problem any more than all the folks that you hear are to blame out of washington gays or immigrants or unions or corporations  for that matter  we don't think that anybody is solely to blame for the challenges that we face  but we do believe we're all responsible to solve those problems  that we're all in this together that as citizens we accept certain responsibilities not only for ourselves but also to our communities and our nation  to make sure that the country creates more opportunity for more people  we understand that america is not just about what can be done for us  but also what's done by us  together  as one nation and as one people  the election   years ago i said in charlotte when we were down there some of you went to the convention i said it was not about me  it was about you  you were the change  you're the reason that there's a mother in madison or green bay that doesn't have to worry about her son being denied medical coverage because of a congenital condition  you made that happen  you're the reason some student at marquette or university of wisconsin has help paying for her college  you're the reason a veteran can go to school on the new gi bill  you did that  you're the reason that families here in wisconsin have gotten a tax cut  money they use to buy groceries and put gas in the car  pay their bills  that's all because of you  you're the reason why some young immigrant who has gone to school here and played with our kids and sworn allegiance to our flag is not going to suddenly be deported from the only country she's ever known  you're the reason that some outstanding soldier can still serve regardless of who they love because we ended  don't ask  don't tell  you're the reason that families across america are able to say to their loved ones who served us so bravely   welcome home  you're the reason  i made this point down in florida a couple days ago  saying that you can't change washington just from the inside  you've got to mobilize the american people  you change it with the help of americans who are willing to make their voices heard  my opponent got really excited  he thought  oh  you know he quickly rewrote his speech   i laughter i  he said  i'll get the job done from the inside  what kind of inside job is he talking about   i laughter i  inside job rubberstamping a top down agenda from this republican congress  we don't want that  we don't want an inside job where the energy policies are written by the oil companies  and health care policies are written by insurance companies  and our tax code is written by outsourcers  we don't need an inside job where a politician in washington is telling women they can't make their own health care decisions  we don't need that kind of inside job  we want to bring change to washington  and from the day we began this campaign  but more importantly  from the day i ran for this office last year or   years ago i laughter i  seems like just last year  i've always said that change is going to take more than one term and one more than one president  and it takes more than one party  it doesn't happen if you write off half the nation before you take office  it happens because you get everybody involved  everybody included black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  gay  straight  able  disabled everybody gets involved  in     percent of the country didn't vote for me  but on election night i said to those americans  i may not have won your vote  but i heard your voices  and i'll be your president  too  and i don't know how many folks will vote for me in wisconsin this time around  but i want everybody in wisconsin to know that  no matter what  i'll be fighting for you  because i'm not fighting to create democratic or republican jobs  i'm fighting to create american jobs  i'm not fighting to improve schools in red states or blue states  i'm improving schools in the united states of america  i don't believe in just looking out for workers or businesses  or rich or poor  or   percent or   percent  i'm going to look out for everybody  that's why i'm running for a second term  that's why i need your vote  and if i get it  and if you're willing to work hard these next     weeks  we will win wisconsin  we will win this election  we will finish what we started  and remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  thank you  thank you "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  l a  are you fired up   i audience members i  fired up   i the president i  are you ready to go   i audience members i  ready to go   i the president i  thank you  thank you  l a  thank you so much  everybody  everybody  thank you  thank you  thank you so much  thank you   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you so much  thank you  everybody  everybody  have a seat  have a seat  now  first of all  i've got some thank yous to make  i am so grateful to george clooney  give it up for george  jennifer hudson  old school earth  wind and fire  jon bon jovi  new school katy perry  stevie wonder  and i understand katy had some choirs out  so give it up for the choirs  i want to thank the members of congress who came today  and i also want to thank two of our country's outstanding mayors  julian castro and your very own antonio villaraigosa  now  i've got to admit that even though my staff all came over early to get the show  i got left behind   i laughter i  but my understanding is it was an incredible show  these guys and everybody here are just incredible professionals  they're such great friends  and they just perform flawlessly night after night  i can't always say the same   i laughter i  but here's the good news  is we've got a better vision for our country  we have a better plan for the next   years  and that's why we're here tonight   i audience member i  love you   i the president i  love you back  we've got some work to do  we've got an election to win  everything we fought for in   is on the line here in   and i need your help to finish what we started  i need your help  four years ago  i told you i'd end the war in iraq  and we did  i said i'd end the war in afghanistan  we are  i said we'd focus on the people who actually attacked us on   and today  usama bin laden is no more  four years ago  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  and we have  by   i promised to cut taxes for small business owners  and we have    times  we got every dime back that was used to rescue the banks  we passed a law to end taxpayer funded wall street bailouts for good  we passed health care reform  also known as obamacare  because i do care about the american people  so your insurance companies can't jerk you around anymore  or tell you that being a women is somehow a preexisting condition  we repealed  don't ask  don't tell  so no outstanding soldier is ever kicked out of the military because of who they love  when governor romney tried to give us his business advice about the economy and said that we should  let detroit go bankrupt  we said  no  thanks  we're not going to take that advice  we reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world  so   years ago    years after that campaign that you were watching on that video  after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  our businesses have now created more than   million jobs  on friday  we found out the unemployment rate has fallen from the height of   percent down to   percent  the lowest since i took office  manufacturing is coming back to america  home values are on the rise  now  we're not there yet  we've still got too many americans looking for work  too many families who can't pay the bills  too many homes underwater  too many young people graduating with too much debt  but if there's one thing i know  we've come a long way  and we've come too far to turn back now  the last thing we can afford right now is   years of the very same policies that led us to this crisis in the first place  i cannot allow that to happen  i will not let it happen  that's why i am running for a second term for president of the united states  and that's why i need your help  i have seen too much pain and too much struggle to let this country go through another round of top down economics  one of the main reasons we had this crisis in the first place is because we had big banks on wall street that were allowed to make big bets with other people's money on the line  and now governor romney wants to roll back the rules so we go back to that behavior  not if i have anything to say about it  one of the main reasons we went from record surpluses under bill clinton to record deficits under george bush is because we put two wars and two tax cuts on a credit card  and now governor romney wants another   trillion in tax cuts that he can't pay for  not if i've got anything to say about it  obviously  the governor knows his   trillion tax cut isn't too popular  so a few weeks before this election  he's trying to pretend it doesn't exist  because that's a lot easier than trying to explain how he'd pay for it without asking middle class families to pick up the tab  the other night he ruled out asking millionaires and billionaires to pay even a dime more in taxes to help us bring down our deficit  not a dime  when he was asked what he'd actually do to cut spending  he said he'd go after public television  so for all you moms and kids out there  don't worry  somebody is finally cracking down on big bird cracking down on him   i laughter i  elmo has made a run for the border  governor romney plans to let wall street run wild again  but he's bringing the hammer down on sesame street   i laughter i  l a  we can't afford another round of tax cuts for folks who don't need them  we can't afford to gut our investments in education or clean energy or research and technology  we can't afford to roll back regulations not just on wall street  but on oil companies and insurance companies  that's not a jobs plan  that's not a plan to grow our economy  that's not change  it's a relapse  we've been there  we have tried that  we're not going back  we are moving forward  that's why i'm running again  that's why i need your help  see  we've got a different view about how we create jobs and prosperity in america  this country doesn't succeed when only the top are doing well  we succeed when the middle class is getting bigger and people have ladders of opportunity to live out their dreams  our economy doesn't grow from the top down  it grows from the middle out and the bottom up  we don't believe that anybody is entitled to success in this country  but we do believe in something called opportunity  we believe in a country where hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded and everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules  that's the country that i believe in  that's the country you believe in  that's what i've been fighting for  for the last   years  that's why i'm running for a second term  we've got a lot more work to do to make sure that everybody is taking part  so here's what we need to do  we've done a lot  we've got a lot more to do  i think it's time to change our tax code so we're not rewarding jobs companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to reward small businesses and manufacturers who make products that are stamped with three proud words  made in america  i want us to control our own energy here in america  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  and that means something here in los angeles  today  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last two decades  so now it's time to move forward  my plan would cut our oil imports in half  by investing in the clean energy that's creating thousands of jobs all across america right now  not just oil and natural gas  but wind power and solar and fuel efficient cars and long lasting batteries  and unlike my opponent  i'm not going to allow oil companies to collect another   billion in taxpayer funded corporate welfare  we're not going to let china win the race for clean energy technology  i want that technology developed right here in the united states  creating jobs right here in the united states  helping our environment right here in the united states  that's what we're fighting for  i want us to have the best education system in the world  make sure that americans from every walk of life are getting the chance they need to get the skills they need to succeed  i would not be standing here if it weren't for an education that i couldn't necessarily afford on my own  it was the gateway of opportunity for me  for michelle  for so many of you  and now you've got a choice  we could gut education to pay for governor romney'   trillion tax break   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  or we can recruit   new math and science teachers  improve our early childhood education system  provide job training for   million workers at our community colleges  work with colleges and universities to cut the growth of tuition costs  we can meet those goals  we can make sure that every young person here in los angeles  here in california  here in the united states of america  no matter what they look like  no matter where they come from  if they're willing to work hard  they can succeed too  that's our goal  that's what we're fighting for  we'd use the money we're saving from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan to pay down our deficit  but also to put people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools all across america  and every brave american who wears the uniform of this country should know that as long as i am commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  and when our troops take off their uniform  we will serve them as well as they've served us  because nobody who has fought for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  let's not just talk about honoring our veterans  let's put our money where our mouth is  that's why i'm running for a second term  fifth  we need to cut the deficit  but we've got to do it in an intelligent way  i've proposed cutting it by   trillion over the next   years  and i've already worked with republicans to cut a trillion dollars of spending  but we can't get this done unless we also look at the other side of the ledger  we don't cut our way to prosperity  we've got to ask the wealthiest among us to pay higher taxes on incomes over   which is the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  our economy created nearly   million new jobs  the biggest surplus in history  and a lot of millionaires did well too  because when we give tax breaks to middle income folks  to lower income folks  they spend it  they need to to pay the bills  which means businesses end up with more customers  they make more profits  and that means they hire more workers  governor romney said it's fair that he pays a lower tax rate than a teacher or an autoworker that makes   i think he's wrong   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  i refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children out of head start programs or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans who are poor or elderly or disabled just to pay for tax cuts we can't afford  and that's the choice that we face in this election  that's what this election comes down to  over and over again  we're told that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if a company releases pollution into the air your children breathe  well  that's the price of progress  if you can't afford to start a business or go to college  just borrow money from your parents  that's not who we are  that's not what this country is about  here in america  we believe in individual initiative and self reliance  but we also believe there are some things we do together  we understand america is not just about what can be done for us  it's about what can be done by us together  as one nation  as one people  you understood that in   it's true even more so now in   because of you  we've made progress  you're the reason there's a little girl with a heart disorder in phoenix who gets the surgery she needs because insurance companies can't limit her coverage  you're the reason a factory worker who lost his job in toledo is back on the line building the best cars in the world  you're the reason a student here in l a  has help paying for her college  the reason a veteran can go to college on the new g i  bill  you're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home  you're the reason that an outstanding soldier won't be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love  you're the reason why thousands of families have finally been able to say to loved ones who served us so bravely   welcome home  you're the reason  and if you turn back now  if you buy into the cynicism that everything that we fought for somehow isn't possible  then of course  change won't happen  if you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference  then other voices will fill the void  the lobbyists and the special interests and the folks who are writing   million checks to beat me and folks who are trying to keep make it harder for you to vote  the politicians in washington who want to control the health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making themselves  you've got to make sure that your voice is heard  only you can make sure that those things don't happen  only you've got the power to move us forward  i've always said i said this back in  that change  real change  takes time  it takes more than one term or one president  it takes more than one party  it can't happen if you write off half the nation before you even take office  back in   everybody always remembers the victory  but they don't always remember the bumps in the road  things always look good in retrospect  but in the middle of it  we were we made all kinds of mistakes  we goofed up  i goofed up  but the american people carried us forward  and even with all the things we had going for us all the way that things just kind of converged  percent of the country still didn't vote for me   i laughter i  i just want to point that out   i laughter i  but on the night of the election  i said to all those americans  i may not have your vote  but i hear your voices  i need your help  i'll be your president too  and i don't know how many will vote for me this time  but i want you to know i'll be there for you no matter what  i'll be fighting just as hard for you as i am for somebody who did vote for me  because i'm not fighting to create republican jobs or democratic jobs  i'm fighting to create american jobs  i'm not fighting to improve schools in red states or blue states  i'm fighting to improve schools in the united states  the values we believe in don't belong to any one group or one party  they're not black or white  or asian or latino or native american  gay  straight  abled  disabled  they are american values  they belong to all of us  and i still believe we're not as divided as our politics suggest  i still believe we've got more in common than the pundits tell us  and most of all  i still believe in you  i still believe in you  and i am asking you to keep on believing in me  i am asking you for your vote  i am asking you to get out there and work  if you are willing to stand with me  if you're willing to work with me  if you're willing to knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls with me  if you're willing to e mail and tweet and call your friends and call your neighbors  talk to your cousins  talk to grandma and grandpa  if you will do that  we will finish what we started in   we will win this election  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  thank you

four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  well  this is an unbelievable crowd  first of all  can everybody please give a huge round of applause to michael for his service to our country  we are proud of him  we've got here your congresswoman and next united states senator  shelley berkley in the house  some outstanding nevadans who are running for congress  steven horsford  john oceguera  and dina titus  i am so grateful to katy perry for the unbelievable performance  katy  i'm getting to know katy  she's just a wonderful young lady  and i can tell that part of it is because of her outstanding grandma ann  a  year resident of nevada  so give her a big round of applause  that's right  the only thing i have to say is  ann got some lipstick on me when she kissed me   i laughter i  so fortunately  somebody wiped it off before michelle saw it   i laughter i  i'm just telling you  you might get me in trouble   i laughter i   i audience member i  we love you  obama   i the president i  i love you back  now  it is great to see all of you  this is the third stop on our  hour  campaign extravaganza  fly around of america  we are pulling an all nighter  no sleep  and if you're not going to sleep  you might as well be in vegas  right   i applause i  might as well be in vegas  we just we've come from colorado  we were in iowa  i stopped by to do leno in l a  right after this  we're going to fly to florida  virginia  ohio  i'm going to stop in chicago to vote  i can't tell you who i'm voting for because it's a secret ballot   i laughter i  but michelle told me she voted for me   i laughter i  see  we can vote early in illinois  just like you can vote early here in nevada  and i've come to nevada to ask you for your vote  i've come to ask you to help me keep america moving forward  now  you now have seen three debates  months of campaigning  way too many tv commercials  you've heard governor romney's sales pitch   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  wait  wait  wait  don't boo  vote  vote  but   i audience members i  vote  vote  vote   i the president i  vote  vote  vote   i audience members i  vote  vote  vote   i the president i  this is a feisty crew behind me here  all right  so you've seen all the commercials  you now have seen governor romney's sales pitch  he's been running around saying he's got a five point plan for the economy  except it turns out  it's a one point plan  folks at the top play by a different set of rules than you do  they get to pay a lower tax rate  they get to outsource more jobs  they want to see wall street run wild again  that was his philosophy in the boardroom  that's was his philosophy as governor  and if it sounds familiar  it's because that was the philosophy that we tried in the decade before i took office  and it led to falling incomes and the slowest job growth in half a century and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  and we've been working for   years to clean up the mess they left behind  governor romney knows this  he knows his plan isn't any different than the policies that led to our recession  so in the final weeks of this election  he has been counting on you to forget  he's hoping you come down with what   i audience members i  romnesia   i the president i  he's hoping you come down with a what we call romnesia   i laughter i  he's hoping you won't remember that his economic plan is more likely to create jobs in china than here in america  because it rewards companies that move jobs and profits overseas  he's hoping you won't remember that he wants to give millionaires and billionaires a   tax cut  because the only way he can pay for it is either blowing up the deficit or asking you to pay higher taxes  he's hoping you will come down with a severe case of romnesia before you cast your ballot  but  las vegas  i want you all to know this  if you feel any symptoms coming on i laughter i fever  a ringing in your ears  blurred vision  not being able to remember what you said just last week if it's coming on  the good news is  we can fix you up  obamacare covers preexisting conditions  we can make you well  there's a cure  nevada  all you've got to do is vote  we could cure this thing   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  listen  i want to get serious for a second  we joke about romnesia  but the reason i bring this up is because it speaks to something serious  and that is the issue of trust  when you elect a president  you don't know exactly what's going to be coming up in the future  you don't know what kind of crisis may arise  you don't know what kind of decisions the president may have to make  but there's no more serious issue in the presidential campaign as than who can you trust  trust matters  who's going to look out for you  and here's the thing  nevada  you know me by now  you know i say what i mean and i mean what i say  we haven't finished everything we set out to do in   but you know that every single day that i set foot in that office  i am thinking about you  i am fighting for your families  and with your help  i've been keeping the commitments that i made  i told you i'd end the war in iraq  and i ended the war in iraq  i said we'd end the war in afghanistan  we are transitioning as we speak  i said we'd refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on   and we have  and there's a new tower rising above the new york skyline  al qaida is on the path to defeat  usama bin laden is dead  our heroes  like michael  are coming home  i have kept those promises  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses  and i have  i promised to end taxpayer funded wall street bailouts for good  and we have  i promised to repeal  don't ask  don't tell  because anybody who loves this country should be able to serve in our military regardless of who they love  i bet on american workers and american ingenuity  and we saved a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world  on issue after issue  we are moving forward  after losing   million jobs in the great recession  our businesses have added more than   million new jobs in the past   years  the unemployment rate is falling  home values and home sales are rising  our assembly lines are humming  we've got a long way to go  nevada  but we've come too far to go back now  we cannot afford to go backwards to the policies that got us into this mess  we've got to go forward  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  that's why i need your vote   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  hold on  hold on a second  hold on  this   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  all right  hold on  hold on  hold on  hold on  i got a little bit i got a little more on my plate here   i laughter i  i got a little more to my agenda   i audience member i  we love you  obama   i the president i  i love you back  but this is about the future  and i have a plan that will actually create jobs and create middle class security  and unlike mitt romney  i'm proud to talk about what's in my plan  i'm not going to pretend what's in my plan is not in my plan  i'm not going to conveniently forget what i said last week about my plan  and the good news is that the math in my plan actually adds up  if you want to take a look  you can go to barackobama com plans  you can share it with your friends and neighbors and coworkers  because there are still people out there who are trying to make up their minds  some of you here may have just come to hear katy perry and still don't know who to vote for   i laughter i  i'm just saying it's possible  some of you might have been dragged here by your girlfriend or boyfriend  they said  you know what  you have to come to the rally  and you didn't feel like coming  but now that you're here  i want you to compare my plans to governor romney's plans  see which plan is better for you  see which plan is better for nevada  see which plan is better for america's future  now  the first thing i want to do  end tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas  reward small businesses and manufacturers who create jobs right here in the united states  the second thing i want to do is cut our oil imports in half by   so we control our own energy  and that also means making sure that we are creating cars and trucks that have higher gas mileage  making sure that we're developing solar and wind and biofuels  the energy sources of the future  we are less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades because of the steps we've taken  but we've got more to do  i want to build on that progress  i don't want fuel efficient cars or solar panels made in china  i want them made here in nevada  i want them made here in america with american workers  and we can do it  and by the way  it will help our environment as well as our economy and our national security  number three  we're going to make it a national mission to educate our kids and train our workers better than anybody else in the world  i want to recruit   math and science teachers  train   million workers at our community colleges to get the skills they need for the jobs that are hiring right now  i want to keep college tuition low so our young people aren't burdened with debt  we can do that  i want us to reduce our deficit by   trillion  but do it in a balanced way  we'll cut out spending we don't need  but i'm also going to ask the wealthiest to pay a little bit more in taxes including me so we can invest in research and technology and provide young people with the support they need for their college educations  those things will keep new jobs and businesses coming to america  and i'm not going to reduce the deficit by turning medicare into a voucher  because no american should spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  and finally  i want to use the savings from ending the war in iraq and afghanistan to put our people back to work doing some nation building here at home  building roads and bridges and schools  sending broadband lines into rural communities  when our veterans come home  i want to serve them as well as they've served us  i want to help them find jobs as police officers and firefighters and first responders  no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads or the care they need when they come home  so that's the plan  nevada  that's how you build a strong  sustainable economy that has good middle class jobs  that's how you encourage new businesses to stay here  that's how you increase take home pay  not by talking about it  but by implementing plans that do it  that's how you build an economy where everybody who works hard has a chance to get ahead  that's what we can do together  and now it's up to you  nevada  right here  right now  today  you have the chance to choose the path we go from here  it's up to the young people here to choose the future that you believe in  that you want to see  it's up to you and the not so young people here  like me  to choose the future we want to leave to the next generation  you can choose the top down policies that got us into this mess  or you can choose the policies that are getting us out  you can choose a foreign policy that's reckless and all over the map  or you can choose one that is steady and strong  you can choose to turn the clock back   years for women and immigrants and gays  or in this election  you can stand up for the principle that america includes everybody  we're all created equal black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  gay  straight  abled  disabled no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from or who you love  in america you can make it if you try  that's what you believe in  nevada  we've been through tough times before  we have been through tough times before  but the american people are always tough  we always come out on top because we pull together  because we look after one another  because we leave nobody behind  we pull folks up  we don't turn backwards  we look forward  we look forward  we look forward to the distant horizon  to new possibilities  to new frontiers  that's what we believe  and that's who we are  our destiny is not written for us  it's written by us  and we can write the next chapter together right now  that's why i'm asking for your vote  and if you give me your vote  i promise you  i will always hear your voices  i will always fight for your families  i will spend every waking hour trying to make your lives a little bit better  i believe in you  i need you to keep believing in me  and if you'll stand with me and work with me and knock on some doors with me  make some calls for me  we'll win clark county again  we'll win nevada again  we'll win this election  we'll finish what we started  we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  thank you  nevada  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  ohio  hello  spartans  can everybody please give john a big round of applause for that great introduction  let's give it up for your former governor  our friend  ted strickland  it is good to be in lima  it's good to be here  good to be back  i have missed you guys  i hadn't been here in a while  obviously  for the past few days  all of us have been focused on what's been happening on the east coast in one of the worst storms in our lifetime  a lot of people died  and our hearts go out to the families  they're in our thoughts and prayers  and i was in jersey a couple of days ago  i've been talking to the governors and the mayors every day over the last week  and what i've been telling them is  it's not just me  it's the entire country  including the people of ohio  who stand with them  we are going to stand with the people of new york  stand with the people of new jersey  stand with the people of connecticut  stand with the people of west virginia every step of the way  we will not stop until we have rebuilt  that's what we're going to do   i applause i  that's what we're going to do  and the interesting thing is when you go through something like this  when you see a crisis of this proportion  it's terrible  and it's sad  but you also are inspired by what you see  by heroes running into buildings and wading through water to save others  neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy  leaders of different political parties working to fix what's broken  instead of trying to figure out how to score political points  it's a spirit that says no matter how bad the storm is  no matter how tough times may get  we always bounce back  we're all in this together  as one nation and as one people  that spirit has guided this country along its improbable journey for more than two centuries  and it's what's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last   years  remember  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  and this morning we learned that companies hired more workers in october than at any time in the last   months  home values are on the rise  housing construction is moving up  we're less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last   years  because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is coming to a close  al qaida has been decimated  and usama bin laden is dead  oh  oh  oh  and one more thing  an american auto industry that had been written off is back on top of the world  so we've made real progress these last   years  but  ohio  we're here because we know we've got more work to do  as long as there is a single american who wants a job and can't find one  as long as there are families who are working harder and harder  but falling behind  as long as there's a child somewhere in lima or anywhere in ohio or anywhere in the country who is languishing in poverty and barred from opportunity  then our fight goes on  our work is not yet done  our fight goes on because we know that this nation cannot succeed without a growing and thriving middle class  our fight goes on because america always does best  always thrives when everybody gets a fair shot  when everybody is doing their fair share  when everybody is playing by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why you elected me in   and that's why i'm running for a second term as president  do i did i hear some drums back there  we've got the band right here  i like that   i laughter i  everybody give it up for the band  now  ohio  in   days  you've got a choice to make  it's not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  it's a choice about two different visions for america  it's a choice between a return to the top down economic policies that almost crashed our economy or a future that's build on a strong and growing middle class  when we talk about the economy i want everybody to be clear we honor the entrepreneurs  the small business people  the strivers  the dreamers  the risk takers  they're the force behind our free enterprise system  and that free enterprise system is the greatest engine or grown and prosperity the world's ever known  but we also believe that the market works  our economy grows  jobs are created  people succeed when we give everybody a good education  we give everybody the chance to learn new skills  when we invest in research and medical breakthroughs and new technologies  we believe america is stronger when everybody can count on affordable health insurance  when everybody can count on medicare and social security  when there are rules to protect our kids from pollution  when there are rule in place to protect consumers from being taken advantage of by credit card companies or mortgage lenders  we believe that our democracy works best when everybody has a voice  and we believe that politicians need to know that they should focus on creating jobs and growing the economy  but they don't need to control health care choices that women can make for themselves  all right  and here's the thing  lima  for   years  we had a president who shared our beliefs  his name was bill clinton  and his economic plan asked the wealthiest to pay a little bit more so we could reduce our deficit and invest in the skills and ideas of our people  and you know what  at the time  republicans in congress and a senate candidate by the name of mitt romney said bill clinton's plan would hurt the economy and kill jobs  sound familiar  it turns out his math was just as bad back then as it is today   i laughter i  because by the end of president clinton's second term  america had created   million new jobs  incomes were up  poverty was down  our deficit became the biggest surplus in history  so  ohio  we've tried our ideas  and they worked   i applause i  they worked  we tried the other folks' ideas  they don't work  because we tried those for the   years before i took office  we tried their ideas  we tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans  we tried giving insurance companies and oil companies and wall street a free license to do whatever they pleased  and what did we get  we got falling incomes  record deficits  the slowest job growth in half a century  and an economic crisis that we've been cleaning up after ever since  so our ideas work  their ideas don't  our ideas help the middle class  their ideas squeeze the middle class  our ideas are responsible for reducing the deficit  their ideas are responsible for raising it  now  governor romney is a very talented salesman  and in this campaign  he's tried as hard as he can to repackage these bad ideas and offer them up as change  he says suddenly now suddenly  he's the candidate of change   i laughter i  but we know what change looks like  and what he's trying to sell  that ain't it   i applause i  it ain't it  giving more power to the biggest banks  that's not change  another   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy  not change  refusing to answer questions about the details of your policies until after the election  not change  that's the oldest trick in the book  ruling out compromise  pledging to rubberstamp the tea party's agenda in congress  not change  trying to change the facts when they're inconvenient to your political campaign  that's definitely not change  that's what governor romney has been doing these last few weeks  right here in ohio john talked about this folks who work at jeep plants have been calling their employers  they're all worried  are we losing our jobs  are our jobs being shipped to china  and then their bosses are having to say  what are you talking about  and the reason they're worried is because governor romney is running an ad that says so  the problem is  it's not true  the car companies themselves have said  no  we're adding jobs here in ohio  we're hiring workers  putting in a new plant  new equipment  the head of gm said creating jobs in the united states should be a source of bipartisan pride  i couldn't agree more  look  i understand governor romney has had a tough time here in ohio because he was against saving the auto industry  and it's hard to run away from a position when you're on videotape saying   let detroit go bankrupt  but you've got to own what you say  this isn't a game  these are people's jobs at stake  these are people's lives  companies like gm and chrysler  they put a lot of time and effort and money into building up their brand  and letting americans know that the american auto industry is back  and we don't want suddenly a bunch of ads saying stuff that's not true  you don't scare hard working americans just to scare up some votes  that's not what being president is all about  when i made the decision to rescue the auto industry  it wasn't popular  even here in ohio   i audience member i  it was to me   i laughter i   i the president i  but i knew it was the right thing to do  betting on american workers was the right thing to do  betting on american ingenuity and know how  that was the right thing to do  and that paid off in lordstown  in toledo  where companies are creating new auto jobs  not in china  right here in ohio  right here in the united states of america  so the thing is here  as you make this choice  as you talk to your friends or your neighbors  you got to remind them one of the things you're choosing is about an issue of trust  after   years as president  you know me  you may not agree with every decision i've made  you may be frustrated sometimes at the pace of change  but you know that i say what i mean and i mean what i say  you know what i believe  you know where i stand  you know i tell the truth  and you know i fight for working families every single day as hard as i know how  so when i tell you i know what real change looks like  i know  because i've got the scars to prove it  i fought for it  and you guys have been there with me  and after all we've been through together  we can't give up now  we cannot give up now  so let me tell you about change over the next   years  change is a country where every young american has a shot at a good education  that's not just the government's job  parents  we've got to parent  students  you got to study  but don't tell me that hiring more teachers won't help grow this economy  don't tell me that students who can't afford college should just borrow money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me  it probably wasn't an option for a whole lot of you  that's why i want to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next   years  that's why i want to recruit   math and science teachers so our kids don't fall behind the rest of the world  i want to train   million americans at our community colleges with the skills that businesses are looking for right now  that's how you grow an economy  that's how you create jobs  educate folks  make sure we've got the best workers in the world  that's what will attract more companies to want to start here and stay here  that's what change is  that's what we're fighting for in this election  change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation  we're not just building cars again  we're building better cars  i was talking to john backstage  the cars we're building now are better  they're smarter  more durable  and these are cars that  by the middle of the next decade  will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  which by the way  that saves your money that saves you money  but it also makes us more energy independent  that's good for our national security  it's good for our environment  today  there are thousands of workers here in ohio and all across the country building long lasting batteries  building wind turbines  building clean energy sources for the future  i don't want to subsidize oil company profits when they're making money hand over fist  i want to support the energy jobs of tomorrow  the advanced manufacturing of tomorrow  i want to cut our oil imports in half  i want that work done here in america  i want to reward companies for creating jobs here in ohio  i want to reward companies to create the next generation of manufacturing here in america  making products stamped with the words  made in america  with american workers  that's what we're fighting for  that's the future i see for this country   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  change real change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home  now  as long as i'm commander in chief  we will pursue our enemies with the strongest military the world's ever known  but it's time to use the savings from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan to pay down our debt  to rebuild america  let's put workers back to work right now  repairing roads and bridges  making sure our schools are state of the art all across this country  and let's focus on our veterans as they come home  because anybody who fights for our freedom shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  that's my commitment to our veterans  but that's also what's going to keep us strong  and that's what's at stake in this election  change is a future where we reduce our deficit  but we do it in a balanced  responsible way  and i've cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending  i intend to do more  but if we're serious about the deficit and we also want to make sure we're still helping kids go to school  investing in basic research that creates new products and new jobs  making sure that our roads are straight  that we've got cutting edge infrastructure all across the country  that we're sending broadband lines into rural communities  if we're going to make sure we're competitive  then we can't just cut our way to prosperity  we've also got to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the tax rates they were paying when bill clinton was in office  and let me tell you  i will be fine without a tax cut  i really would  mitt romney will definitely be fine without a tax cut   i laughter i  don't need it  and as long as i'm president  i'm not going to turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i'm not going to make young people pay more to go to college just for a tax cut for me or mitt romney  so  lima  we know what change is  we know what the future requires  and  by the way  we know it's not going to be easy  these last   years we had to fight  and it's never going to be easy  we talked about this in   when i ran in   i wasn't just talking about changing presidents  i wasn't just talking about changing parties  i was talking about changing our politics  i ran because the voices of the american people your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long  by lobbyists and special interests  by politicians who will do whatever it takes and say whatever it takes to keep things just the way they are  protectors of the status quo  and over the last   years  the status quo in washington has fought us every step of the way  they spent millions to try to stop us from reforming health care  spent millions trying to stop us from reforming wall street  spent millions trying to stop us from reforming our student loan programs  they engineered a strategy of gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise even on ideas that they used to support  and what they're counting on now is that you're going to be so fed up  so worn down by all the squabbling  all the arguing in washington  so tired of all the dysfunction  that you're just going to give up  walk away  and let them go ahead and keep their power   i audience members i  no   i the president i  no  no   i audience members i  no   i the president i  in other words  they're betting on cynicism  ohio  my bet is on you  my bet is on hope  my bet is on the decency and goodness of the american people  and my fight is for you  look  i would love to see peace and cooperation in washington  i'd love it  it would make my life easier   i laughter i  and when the other party has been with me to help middle class families  to help working families  i've worked with them happily  like when we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses  some of them supported me  when we came together to repeal  don't ask  don't tell  some courageous republican senators supported that  i will work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  and if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you're going to vote for leaders who feel the same way whether they're democrats  republicans  or independents people who are willing to put people first instead of putting elections first  but if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals that kick students off of financial aid or getting rid of funding for planned parenthood or let insurance companies discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or eliminate health care for millions on medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled  i'm not going with that  that's too high a price to pay  that's not bipartisanship  that's not change  that's just surrendering to the same status quo that's hurt middle class families for way too long  and i don't know about you  ohio  but i'm not ready to give up on the fight  i may have gotten grayer  but i'm still determined  i'm determined to help working families all across ohio  i'm determined to build ladders of opportunity for folks who are having a hard time  but want to get into that middle class  and i hope you're not tired either   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i hope you're not weary   i audience members i  no  the folks at the very top in this country  they don't need another champion in washington  they'll always have a seat at the table  they'll always have access  they'll always have influence  we understand that  but the people who really need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day  the laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of   for a new career at a community college  she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who needs a loan to expand after the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and the waiters and the cleaning staff working overtime in some vegas hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who was laid off and thought the plant would never reopen and now is back on the job filled with pride and dignity  building a great car  he needs a champion  all those kids  all the kids in inner cities and small farm towns black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  gay  straight  able  disabled kids all across this country  in rolling hills in virginia or in the valleys of ohio or right here in lima  kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors  engineers or entrepreneurs  diplomats or even a president  they need a champion in washington  they need somebody fighting for them because the future is theirs  but they'll never have lobbyists in washington working for them  they need a president who is working for them  they need a president who is fighting for them  and that's why i need you  ohio  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we've come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint  now is the time to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids  to train all our workers  to create new jobs  rebuild our infrastructure  discover new sources of energy  broaden opportunity  grow our middle class  restore our democracy  and to make sure that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from  what your last name is  where you started  no matter what  you can make it in america if you try  ohio  that's why i need your vote  and if you're willing to work with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls with me and turn out to the polls with me  we'll win this election  we'll win ohio  we'll strengthen the bonds between our people  and we'll refer we'll reaffirm the spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america  now let's go vote "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  ohio   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  how's it going  bearcats  got some bearcats in the house  are you fired up   i audience members i  ready to go   i the president i  fired up   i audience members i  ready to go   i the president i  fired up   i audience members i  ready to go   i the president i  oh  you sound pretty fired up  can everybody please give julie a big round of applause for the great introduction  give it up for your mayor  mark mallory  who's here  this is a nice crowd here  thank you so much  now  those of you who have seats  if you want to get comfortable  feel free  those of you who don't have seats  you're stuck   i laughter i  you know  for the past several days  all of us have been focused on what's happening on the east coast  one of the worst storms of our lifetimes  and the images have been heartbreaking  we've seen those who   i at this point  there was a disruption in the audience i   i the president   i we're okay   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  so i laughter i   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  i guess you all are still fired up  but on the east coast  what we've seen are folks who are going through some incredible difficulties  there are those who have lost loved ones  and i had a chance to visit new jersey and talk to some of the families who have been affected  and   i the disruption in the audience continued i   i the president i  it's okay   i applause i  it's okay  guys  we're okay  but here i applause i  all right  let me try this again  no  no  no  listen up because this is important  first of all  cincinnati  ohio knows what it's like sometimes to get hit by terrible storms  and we've seen families lose loved ones  and we've seen people's lives upended  and so i hope that all of you are understanding that this rebuilding is going to take a long time  those of you who can help through the red cross  we need you to help  and when i went to new jersey  what i told them was  i come not just as a president  but as a fellow citizen  and i'm confident i speak for all americans when i say that no matter how long the road  no matter how difficult  we are going to be with them every step of the way in helping them to rebuild their lives  and we're going to do it together  during tragedies like this  obviously our hearts are broken  but we're also inspired   i the disruption in the audience continued i   i the president i  it's okay  folks  everybody  it's okay  we're good   i applause i  so the these might have been some tennessee titans fans who were mad about the bears beating them really badly today  my chicago bears did pretty good  but we've also been inspired these past few days by the images of police officers and firefighters and ems folks running through water and pulling folks out of buildings  neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy  leaders of different parties working together to fix what's broken  what we've seen is a spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is  no matter how tough times may get  we're all in this together  we rise or fall as one nation  as one people  and that spirit has guided this country along its improbable journey for two centuries now   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  it's that spirit has also carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last   years  these have been a tough   years  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  the american auto industry is back on top  home values are on the rise  we're less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in   years  because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is coming to a close  al qaida has been decimated  usama bin laden is dead  we've made progress  we've made real progress these past   years  but here's the thing  ohio  we know we've got more work to do  that's why we're here today  because we've got more work to do  as long as there's a single american who wants a job  but can't find one  our work is not yet done  as long as there are families working harder and harder  but still falling behind  our work's not done  as long as there's a child anyplace in cincinnati  anyplace in ohio  anyplace in the united states of america  who's languishing in poverty  who's barred from opportunity  the fight goes on  our fight goes on because this nation cannot succeed without a growing  thriving middle class and sturdy ladders for all who are willing to work hard to get into the middle class  our fight goes on because we know america always does its best when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody's doing their fair share and everybody's playing by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why you elected me in   and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  now  in   days  america has got a choice to make  you in ohio  you've already been making the choice because you've got early vote  and those of you who have not yet voted  you can still vote tomorrow and tuesday  so don't wait  but there may be some folks who are still undecided  just decided you wanted to hear stevie   i laughter i  i can't argue with that  but for those of you or your friends or your neighbors who are still trying to make up their minds  this is not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  it's a choice between two different visions of america  it's a choice between a return to the top down policies that crashed our economy  or the strong  growing middle class based policies that are getting us out of a crisis  now  understand look  as americans  we believe in the free market  we believe in free enterprise  we believe in the strivers  the dreamers  the risk takers  we know they've always been the driving force behind our economy  the greatest engine of growth and prosperity the world's ever known  that's what we believe  but we also believe that in this country  the free market and free enterprise work best when everybody has got a chance to participate  when everybody is getting a good education and the skills they need to compete  when  together  we're investing in research for medical breakthroughs and new technologies  we believe america works best  is stronger  when everybody can count on affordable health insurance  just like julie and nathan  when they can count on medicare and social security in their golden years  when there are rules to protect our kids from pollution  rules to protect consumers from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous credit card companies or mortgage lenders  and then  we believe there are some things that washington should just stay out of  like we believe no politician especially a whole bunch of male politicians in washington should control the health care choices women can make for themselves  now  for   years  we had a president who shared these beliefs  his name was bill clinton  and so we were able to put our ideas to the test  his economic plan when he came in asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little more so we could reduce our deficit and invest in the skills and ideas of our people  and at the time  the republican congress and a senate candidate by the name of mitt romney said that bill clinton's plan would hurt the economy and kill jobs  turns out  his math was just as bad back then as it is now  because by the end of president clinton's second term  america had created   million new jobs  and incomes were up  and poverty was down  and our deficit became the biggest surplus in history  so our ideas have been put to the test  we know they work  now  the other guy's ideas have been put to the test also  because after president clinton  we had   years in which we tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans  we tried giving insurance companies and oil companies and wall street a free license to do whatever they pleased  and what we got was falling incomes and record deficits and the slowest job growth in   years and an economic crisis that we're still cleaning our way out of  so stay with me here we got ideas that work  and we got ideas that don't work  and so the choice should be pretty clear  but governor romney is a very talented salesman  and so in this campaign  he's tried as hard as he can to repackage the old ideas that didn't work as new ideas  in fact  he's offered them up as change  says he's the candidate of change   i laughter i  now  here's the thing  cincinnati  it turns out  we know what change looks like  and what governor romney is selling is not change  giving more power back to the biggest banks  that's not change  another   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy  not change  refusing to answer questions about the details of your policy until after the election  definitely not change  that's the oldest trick in the book  ruling out compromise by pledging to rubberstamp the tea party's agenda in congress  not change  changing the facts when they're inconvenient to your campaign  not change  governor romney's been having a tough time here in ohio because everybody knows he was against saving the auto industry in a state where one in eight jobs is connected to the american auto industry  so he decided to solve that problem by running ads that say the jeep plant here in ohio is shipping jobs to china  even though everyone knows the jeep plant isn't shipping jobs to china  that's not a good closing argument to the people of ohio i   i and the problem is  this isn't a game  you don't scare people just to scare up some votes  you don't have workers in the jeep plant calling up their boss saying   am i about to lose my job  because they've seen an ad on tv that's not true  that's not what being president's all about  and so when you're thinking about this choice  or your talking to your friends and neighbors about this choice  you've got to remind them it's not just about policy  it's also about trust  who do you trust   i audience members i  you   i the president i  look  ohio  you know me by now  you may not agree with every decision i've made  michelle doesn't agree with me on everything   i laughter i  you may sometimes be frustrated at the pace of change  i get frustrated at the pace of change sometimes  but you know i say what i mean and i mean what i say  i said i'd end the war in iraq  i ended the war in iraq  i said i'd pass health care reform  i passed it  i said i'd repeal  don't ask  don't tell  i repealed it  i said i'd help young people afford a college education  we expanded pell grants  lowered student loans  i do what i say  you know where i stand  and you know what i believe  you know i tell the truth  and you know i'll fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  so when i tell you i know what real change looks like  it's because i've fought for it  because i delivered it  because i've got the scars to prove it  because that's why my hair went gray   i laughter i  and  ohio  after all we've been together  we can't give up on it now  we got to keep on going and bring some more change to america  we've got more work to do  so let me tell you  over the next   years  here's what change is  change is a country where every american has a shot at a great education  now  government can't do this alone  parents have to parent  students have to study  bearcats  i want you to hit the books now  don't just have fun here  but don't tell me that hiring more teachers won't help this economy grow  of course it will  don't tell me that students who can't afford college should just borrow money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me  and i'll bet it's not an option for a lot of you  that's why i want to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next   years  that's why i want to recruit   math and science teachers  so our kids don't fall behind the rest of the world  that's why i want to train   million americans at our community colleges with the skills that businesses are hiring for right now  that's my plan  that's what change is  that's what we're fighting for in this election  change is when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation  i'm very proud that i bet on american workers  american ingenuity  and the american auto industry  but i'm especially proud because we're not just building cars  we're building better cars here in ohio  here in the midwest  here in america  cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that helps our environment  that helps our economy  that helps our national security  but we don't want to just stop at cars  we want advanced manufacturing all across this country  there are thousands of workers building long lasting batteries  building wind turbines  building solar panels  i don't want a tax code that simply subsidizes oil company profits when they're making money hand over fist  i want to support the energy jobs of tomorrow  i want to support the new technology that will cut our oil imports in half  i don't want a tax code that rewards companies shipping jobs overseas  i want to reward companies investing here in ohio  manufacturing with american workers  that's my plan for jobs and growth  that's the future i see  change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home  as long as i'm commander in chief  we will pursue our enemies with the strongest military the world's ever known  but it's time for us to use some of the savings from ending the wars in iraq and winding down  transitioning in afghanistan to pay down our debt  to rebuild america  let's put some folks back to work right now repairing roads and bridges  and there's a bridge right here in cincinnati that needs some work  let's make sure we've got schools that are state of the art all across this country  and let's especially hire our veterans  because if you fought for this country and its freedom  you shouldn't have to fight for a job when you come home  that's what will keep us strong  that's my commitment to you  and that's what's at stake in this election  change is a future where we reduce our deficit and our debt  but we do it in a balanced  responsible way  i've signed a trillion dollars' worth of spending cuts  i intend to do more  but if we're serious about our deficit  we can't just cut our way to prosperity  we've also got to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the same tax rates they paid when bill clinton was in office  and the reason  cincinnati  is because a budget is about choices  it's about values  it's about priorities  we can't do everything  we've got to make some decisions in terms of what's important  and as long as i'm president  i won't turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i won't throw kids off of head start just to pay for another tax cut for me  i don't need it  those kids need it  i don't need it  so we know what change is  we know what the future requires  and we also know it's not easy  it's not easy bringing about change  back in   when we talked about change we believe in  i warned people look  i wasn't just talking about changing presidents  i wasn't just talking about changing political parties  i was talking about changing how our system of politics works  i ran because the voices of the american people your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long  by lobbyists and special interests and politicians who will say and do whatever it takes just to keep things the way they are  the protectors of the status quo  they're powerful  and they've fought us every step of the way in washington  they spent millions to try to stop us from reforming health care  spent millions to try to stop us from reforming wall street  and when we got all those things through  they engineered a strategy of gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise even on ideas that both democrats and republicans used to support  like obamacare  which started out in massachusetts under governor romney  it worked fine when a republican was sponsoring it  and suddenly  it was terrible when a democrat put it forward   i laughter i  and the reason they've done this look  it's a strategy  they made a calculation  what they're counting on is that you will be so worn down by all the squabbling  you'll be tired of all the dysfunction  you'll just be fed up  and you'll ultimately give up on the idea of change  you'll walk away  you'll leave them in power  you'll decide things can't change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  in other words  their bet is on cynicism  but  ohio  my bet's on you  my bet's on you   i applause i  my bet's on the common sense and decency of the american people  and by the way  this is not a partisan idea  when the other party has been willing to work with me to advance the cause of middle class and working class families  i've been right there with them  we worked with republicans and democrats to cut middle class taxes  to cut taxes for small businesses  we came together to repeal  don't ask  don't tell  we had some courageous republican senators get involved  i will work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  and if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders whether they're democrats  republicans  independents who feel the same way  who put you first  who don't put politics or the next election first  but if we want meaningful change that actually helps families  then we also have some principles  there have to be some things that we're willing to fight for  if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals that kick students off of financial aid or get rid of funding for planned parenthood or let insurance companies discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or eliminate health care for millions on medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled  then that's a price i'm not willing to pay  that's not bipartisanship  that's not change  that's surrender to the same status quo that has hurt too many families for too long  and i am not ready to give up on the fight just yet  i am not ready to give up on that fight  and i hope you aren't either  ohio   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i hope you aren't either  see  the folks at the very top in this country  they don't need another champion in washington  they'll always have a seat at the table  they'll always have access and influence  the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night when i get up from the oval office  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day  the laid off worker who has to go back at the age of   to retrain at a community college  she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who has some really good food  but not a lot of money and needs a loan to expand after the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and the waiters and the cleaning staff working overtime at a cincinnati hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college  they need a champion  the autoworker back on a job  feeling proud because he's building a great car  he needs a champion  that teacher in a classroom  overcrowded classroom  digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies  not getting the support she needs  but knowing maybe this day that one child will learn something  and that makes it all worthwhile  she needs a champion  all those kids in inner cities and small farm town  in the valleys of ohio  the rolling virginia hills  kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors or engineers or entrepreneurs  businessmen  diplomats  maybe even a president  they need a champion in washington  they don't have a lobbyist  the future doesn't have the same kind of lobbyists as the status quo  but it's the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace  and that's why i need you  ohio  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we've come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint  we've got to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids and train all our workers  to create new jobs  to bring our troops home  to care for our veterans  to broaden opportunity  to grow a middle class  to restore our democracy  to make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from or how you started out or what you look like  you can make it in america   i applause i  you can make it if you try  and  ohio  that's why i'm asking you for your vote  i need you  ohio  and if you're willing to work with me and knock on some doors with me  if you're willing to early vote for me  make some phone calls for me  turn out for me  we'll win ohio  we'll win this election  we'll renew the bonds and reaffirm the spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america  hey "]]
