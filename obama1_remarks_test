[["obama1", "let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled  from far and wide  to brave the cold today we all made this journey for a reason  it's humbling  but in my heart i know you didn't come here just for me  you came here because you believe in what this country can be  in the face of war  you believe there can be peace  in the face of despair  you believe there can be hope  in the face of a politics that's shut you out  that's told you to settle  that's divided us for too long  you believe we can be one people  reaching for what's possible  building that more perfect union that's the journey we're on today  but let me tell you how i came to be here  as most of you know  i am not a native of this great state  i moved to illinois over two decades ago  i was a young man then  just a year out of college  i knew no one in chicago  was without money or family connections  but a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for   a year  and i accepted the job  sight unseen  motivated then by a single  simple  powerful idea   that i might play a small part in building a better america my work took me to some of chicago's poorest neighborhoods  i joined with pastors and lay people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings  i saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature   that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives  that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away  and that when a child turns to violence  there's a hole in his heart no government alone can fill it was in these neighborhoods that i received the best education i ever had  and where i learned the true meaning of my christian faith after three years of this work  i went to law school  because i wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need  i became a civil rights lawyer  and taught constitutional law  and after a time  i came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate  it was with these ideas in mind that i arrived in this capital city as a state senator it was here  in springfield  where i saw all that is america converge   farmers and teachers  businessmen and laborers  all of them with a story to tell  all of them seeking a seat at the table  all of them clamoring to be heard  i made lasting friendships here   friends that i see in the audience today it was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable   that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised  and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other  we can assume the best in people instead of the worst that's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken  that's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need  that's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families  and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never  ever be passed it was here  in springfield  where north  south  east and west come together that i was reminded of the essential decency of the american people   where i came to believe that through this decency  we can build a more hopeful america and that is why  in the shadow of the old state capitol  where lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together  where common hopes and common dreams still  i stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the united states i recognize there is a certain presumptuousness   a certain audacity   to this announcement  i know i haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of washington  but i've been there long enough to know that the ways of washington must change the genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed  and we should take heart  because we've changed this country before  in the face of tyranny  a band of patriots brought an empire to its knees  in the face of secession  we unified a nation and set the captives free  in the face of depression  we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty  we welcomed immigrants to our shores  we opened railroads to the west  we landed a man on the moon  and we heard a king's call to let justice roll down like water  and righteousness like a mighty stream each and every time  a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done  today we are called once more   and it is time for our generation to answer that call for that is our unyielding faith   that in the face of impossible odds  people who love their country can change it that's what abraham lincoln understood  he had his doubts  he had his defeats  he had his setbacks  but through his will and his words  he moved a nation and helped free a people  it is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided  north and south  slave and free  it is because men and women of every race  from every walk of life  continued to march for freedom long after lincoln was laid to rest  that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together  as one people   as americans all of us know what those challenges are today   a war with no end  a dependence on oil that threatens our future  schools where too many children aren't learning  and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can  we know the challenges  we've heard them  we've talked about them for years what's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans  what's stopped us is the failure of leadership  the smallness of our politics   the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial  our chronic avoidance of tough decisions  our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems for the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter  we've been told that the anxiety americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion  we've been told that climate change is a hoax  and that tough talk and an ill conceived war can replace diplomacy  and strategy  and foresight  and when all else fails  when katrina happens  or the death toll in iraq mounts  we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault  we're distracted from our real failures  and told to blame the other party  or gay people  or immigrants and as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration  we know what's filled the void  the cynics  and the lobbyists  and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play  they write the checks and you get stuck with the bills  they get the access while you get to write a letter  they think they own this government  but we're here today to take it back  the time for that politics is over  it's time to turn the page we've made some progress already  i was proud to help lead the fight in congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since watergate but washington has a long way to go  and it won't be easy  that's why we'll have to set priorities  we'll have to make hard choices  and although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need  more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go  each of us  in our own lives  will have to accept responsibility   for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children  for adapting to a more competitive economy  for strengthening our communities  and sharing some measure of sacrifice  so let us begin  let us begin this hard work together  let us transform this nation let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age  let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed  let's recruit a new army of teachers  and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability  let's make college more affordable  and let's invest in scientific research  and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across america and as our economy changes  let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity  let's protect the hard earned benefits their companies have promised  let's make it possible for hardworking americans to save for retirement  and let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle class again let's be the generation that ends poverty in america  every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job  and earn a living wage that can pay the bills  and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work  let's do this let's be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis  we can control costs by focusing on prevention  by providing better treatment to the chronically ill  and using technology to cut the bureaucracy  let's be the generation that says right here  right now  that we will have universal health care in america by the end of the next president's first term let's be the generation that finally frees america from the tyranny of oil  we can harness homegrown  alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel efficient cars  we can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases  we can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation  and job creation  and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world  let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here most of all  let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that september day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got  politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore   we can work together to keep our country safe  i've worked with republican senator dick lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest  unguarded weapons  we can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military  we can tighten the net around their finances  and we can improve our intelligence capabilities  but let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe but all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in iraq  most of you know i opposed this war from the start  i thought it was a tragic mistake  today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones  the hearts that have been broken  and the young lives that could have been  america  it's time to start bringing our troops home  it's time to admit that no amount of american lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war  that's why i have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by march of   letting the iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last  best hope to pressure the sunni and shia to come to the table and find peace finally  there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war   and that is the homecoming of the men and women   our veterans   who have sacrificed the most  let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love  let us be the generation that begins this work i know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things  i understand the skepticism  after all  every four years  candidates from both parties make similar promises  and i expect this year will be no different  all of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten point plans and making grand speeches  all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country  but too many times  after the election is over  and the confetti is swept away  all those promises fade from memory  and the lobbyists and the special interests move in  and people turn away  disappointed as before  left to struggle on their own that is why this campaign can't only be about me  it must be about us   it must be about what we can do together  this campaign must be the occasion  the vehicle  of your hopes  and your dreams  it will take your time  your energy  and your advice   to push us forward when we're doing right  and to let us know when we're not  this campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship  restoring our sense of common purpose  and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change by ourselves  this change will not happen  divided  we are bound to fail but the life of a tall  gangly  self made springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible he tells us that there is power in words he tells us that there is power in conviction that beneath all the differences of race and region  faith and station  we are one people he tells us that there is power in hope as lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery  he was heard to say   of strange  discordant  and even hostile elements  we gathered from the four winds  and formed and fought to battle through that is our purpose here today that's why i'm in this race not just to hold an office  but to gather with you to transform a nation i want to win that next battle   for justice and opportunity i want to win that next battle   for better schools  and better jobs  and health care for all i want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union  and building a better america and if you will join me in this improbable quest  if you feel destiny calling  and see as i see  a future of endless possibility stretching before us  if you sense  as i sense  that the time is now to shake off our slumber  and slough off our fear  and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations  then i'm ready to take up the cause  and march with you  and work with you  together  starting today  let us finish the work that needs to be done  and usher in a new birth of freedom on this earth "], ["obama1", "each year at this time we honor and think about the fathers who've been a part of our lives   the examples they've set  the sacrifices they've made  their successes and their struggles  i think about my grandfather  who first became a father when my mother was born on a kansas army base at the outset of world war ii  he left to fight fascism in europe while my grandmother stayed behind and pitched in on a bomber assembly line  with the nation still dragging itself out of depression  i imagine he must have felt uncertain at that time about what the future held for his family  and yet he returned to a country newly committed to opportunity   a country that gave him a chance to go to college on the gi bill  buy a house thanks to the federal housing authority  and move west to hawaii to raise his family  i also think about my father in law  fraser robinson  he raised his two children with his wife marian in  s chicago  they faced what other african american families faced at the time   both hidden and overt forms of racism that limited their opportunities and required more effort to get ahead  and they faced an additional obstacle  at age   fraser was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis  and yet  every day of his life  even when he had to rely on a walker to get him there  he went to work at the local water filtration plant while marian stayed home with the children  and on that single salary  fraser robinson provided for his family  sending my wife michelle and her brother craig to princeton  and of course  though i did not know him well  every year around father's day i think of my own father  he and my mother divorced when i was only two years old  and for most of my life i knew him only through the letters he sent and the stories my mother and grandparents told  in his absence  it was more difficult for my mother to raise me and my sister on one salary during the  s  and we struggled  at times turning to food stamps to get us through the month  and yet  through the support of my grandparents  the sheer will and determination of my mother  and the blessings of generous scholarships  i was able to attend some of the best schools in the country   schools that made it possible for me to stand here today  it has not been lost on either michelle or myself that our family's story has been america's story   a story of opportunity  and possibility  and the tireless pursuit of a dream that was always within reach  our parents and grandparents were given no guarantees  and they certainly had their share of failings and hardship  but theirs was a country where if you wanted it badly enough  and were willing to work for it  and take responsibility  you could provide for your family and give your children the same chance  there are fewer and fewer families who can tell this story today  unlike my grandfather  the brave soldiers who return from iraq and afghanistan are lucky if they come home to a job that pays the bills  or even the benefits and care they've earned as veterans  blue collar workers like fraser robinson have seen their benefits decline  and their unions weakened  and their wages flattened while the cost of everything else rises  and as many of you know too well  single parents no longer have the support system that my mother did  with too many fathers financially unable to help raise their children even if they want to do the right thing  over the last few decades  fundamental changes in the way we work and live have trapped too many american families between an economy that's gone global and a government that's gone awol  too many rungs have been removed from the ladder to middle class security  and the safety net that's supposed to break any falls from that ladder has grown badly frayed  many families face increased anxiety when it comes to paying the bills or finding ways to spend more time with their children  while others have tumbled into poverty  watching jobs disappear  and fathers leave the home  and even though the vast majority of mothers are now working   including single mothers   we haven't yet provided them with the support they need to raise their children  i don't have to give you a history lesson in economics for you to know how this all happened  because many of you have seen it or even lived it  you've seen the factories close their doors and move overseas  leaving too many cities and mill towns without their biggest source of employment  i saw it when i first arrived in chicago in the early  s  where i took a job helping to rebuild neighborhoods that had been devastated by steel plant closings  and today  it's not just factory jobs that are disappearing  as countries like china and india churn out more workers who are educated longer and better  revolutions in technology and communication have made it possible for american companies to automate some jobs and send others wherever there's an internet connection  the jobs that remain pay less and offer fewer benefits  as employers have succeeded in busting up unions and cutting back on health care and pensions to stay competitive with the companies abroad that are paying their workers next to nothing  the weekly earnings of american workers  which had steadily risen during the years our parents and grandparents were employed  have fallen more than twenty percent since   and the minimum wage hasn't moved in ten years  this means that right now  a family of three with one minimum wage earner is still more than   below the poverty line  most americans are vulnerable to these new risks  but without a doubt  the hardest hit have been those families who were most vulnerable to begin with  they are families who live in inner cities and remote rural areas  they are disproportionately african american and latino  in the last six years  over   black males have lost jobs in the manufacturing sector   the highest rate of any ethnic group  in urban areas  more than   of black men do not complete high school  in one survey  nearly one out of every three african american families said they experienced at least one of three hardships in the last year   overcrowded housing  a lack of medical care  or hunger  without a job or an education  many black men simply cannot afford to raise a family   and too many have made the sad choice not to  today    of all african american children live in single parent households  a number that has doubled since   now  many single moms   including the one who raised me   do a heroic job on behalf of their kids  but in an economy where a two income family has become a financial necessity  a fatherless household takes its toll  children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and nine times more likely to drop out of school  providing these families with the same chances that previous generations have had is a daunting challenge  but it is certainly one we can meet  many of us here in this room have seen how this progress can be achieved  all across this state  the south carolina center for fathers and families has helped countless families climb out from poverty by connecting fathers employment opportunities and encouraging them to take responsibility for their children  you have turned lives around and you have given so many children a better future and for that you should feel very proud  i've also been blessed to see this progress myself  there was a lot of hopelessness in those south side neighborhoods when i first arrived in chicago as a community organizer  but we set up job training programs and after school programs and counseling programs and after a while  those neighborhoods started to come around  later  when i became a state senator in illinois  i made sure we expanded the earned income tax credit so we could put   million of tax cuts into the pockets of working families  i made sure we provided health insurance for another   children and   parents  and we expanded early childhood education to give kids the best possible start in life  so we know what needs to be done when it comes to giving our families a fighting chance  and i think it's time we finally had a president who gets washington to start doing it  i don't know about you  but i'm tired of hearing that town tell us we can't  for too long  they've told us we can't do anything about disappearing jobs and stagnant wages  they've told us that we can't lower our health care costs or the price of college tuition  they've told us that poverty is a nuisance to blame on the impoverished  not a moral shame that should outrage a nation  we're assured that the market will correct all our misfortunes  and that there's no problem that can't be solved by another tax break that the wealthy didn't need and didn't ask for  well  we have tried it their way for six years and we're ready to try something new  it's time to turn the page  we are not a country that settles for survival of the fittest  but a people who have always fought for survival of the nation  that's how we got a gi bill that sent a generation to college and created the largest middle class in history  that's how we gave workers the right to organize and form a union  that's how we got social security and medicare so that americans could retire in comfort and dignity  now we have to do it again  and it won't be easy  we know that we can't put the forces of globalization back in the bottle  we cannot bring back every job that's been lost  we have to find a way to make this new economy work for us  we also know that government cannot meet this challenge alone   that there is not a program for every problem we face  it will take responsibility and sacrifice from the american people  changes in habits and attitudes  we will need to work more  read more  train more  and think more  parents will need to make sure their kids turn off the tv once in a while  and put away the video games  and start hitting the books  and there are a lot of men out there who need to stop acting like boys  who need to realize that responsibility does not end at conception  who need to know that what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child but the courage to raise one  but just as we have individual responsibilities  at the dawn of the  st century we also have a collective responsibility to strengthen that safety net  put the rungs back on that ladder to the middle class  and give every family the chance that so many of our parents and grandparents had  this responsibility is one that's been missing from washington for far too long   a responsibility i intend to take very seriously as president  we know what we need to do to help every family compete and prosper in a globalized world  we know that we need to invest in the science and technology that will make america the home for the high tech  high wage jobs of tomorrow  we know that to fill these jobs  we'll also have to get serious about educating our workforce for the  st century  this means starting our kids in school younger  with more early childhood education opportunities like the four year old kindergarten program you've been trying to pass here in south carolina  it means improving our public schools by recruiting thousands of new teachers and paying them more and asking more of them  and it means making college affordable for every american who wants to go by offering more loans and bigger grants  and of course  in a world of increased risks and insecurities  we also know that every american needs a health care plan and a retirement plan that stays with them no matter where they work or even if they can't find work  that's why a few weeks ago  i introduced a universal health care plan that would not only cover every american by allowing the uninsured to buy into a similar kind of plan that members of congress get themselves  but it would cut costs and save a typical family up to   a year  so we know that we need this broader agenda to help families get ahead in this new world  but we also know that for the families who've been hit hardest by these economic changes  we have to help them get started before we can help them get ahead   we have to empower them to grab that first rung of the ladder before they start climbing  that's why today i want to lay out a plan that would strengthen some of our most vulnerable families by ensuring that they can find a job  stay out of poverty  and get the support they need to raise their children  first  we need to ensure that everyone who is willing to work can find a job  since south carolina has lost   manufacturing jobs in the last six years and   more people are out of work  this certainly isn't easy  but it's a promise we have to keep in this country  so  for those americans who have been searching unsuccessfully for employment  i will invest   million in programs that will place willing workers into transitional jobs and train them for permanent ones  these programs have already proven to be highly successful in the many communities that have tried them  people get the chance to work in a community service type job  earn a paycheck every week  and learn the skills they need for gainful employment  and by leaving with references and a resume  often times they find that employment  still  even for those workers who do find a permanent job  many times there is no way for them to advance their careers once they're in those jobs  that's why we'll also work with community organizations and businesses to create career pathways that provide workers with the additional skills and training they need to earn more money and keep climbing up that ladder to middle class security  unions and various communities have done this quite successfully  and this program would build on that model  the second step we'll take to strengthen families is to ensure that working americans are not impoverished americans  one of the most successful anti poverty programs in history has been the earned income tax credit   additional income that lifts nearly   million americans out of poverty every year  as president  i will double the number of single workers who receive the eitc and triple the benefit for full time workers making the minimum wage  from the   they get today to   and instead of waiting every ten years for congress to fight over raising the minimum wage  i will finally make the minimum wage a living wage by permanently indexing it to inflation so that it actually pays the bills  the third step we'll take to strengthen families is to give them the support they need to raise their children  as president  i'll start by passing the plan i outlined last year that would make it easier for fathers who make the responsible choice and harder for those who avoid it  it's a plan that would remove some of the financial penalties the government currently imposes on married couples  cut out the red tape to ensure that every dime of child support goes directly to children instead of bureaucrats  and provide fathers who are paying their child support an even larger eitc benefit  this plan would also crack down on those who avoid their responsibility by increasing child support enforcement  a measure that will collect nearly   billion in payments that can help raise  nurture  and educate children  we should also help new mothers with their new responsibilities  there is a pioneering nurse family partnership program right now that offers home visits by trained registered nurses to low income mothers and mothers to be  they learn how to care for themselves before the baby is born and what to do after  they are counseled on substance abuse  creating and achieving personal goals  and effective methods of nurturing children  where it's been tried  this program reduced childhood injuries and unintended pregnancies  increased father involvement and women's employment  reduced use of welfare and food stamps  and increased children's school readiness  and it produced more than   in net savings for every high risk family enrolled in the program  as president  i will expand the nurse family partnership to provide at home nurse visits for up to   first time mothers each year  my plan would also support families with children by expanding the child tax credit to an additional   more americans  who would receive   per child  and for all those families where both parents work and don't know what to do when their child has to stay home sick for the day  my plan guarantees every worker seven paid days of sick leave each year  none of this agenda will happen overnight  nor will it be easy to get done  but then again  america's story hasn't been all that easy itself  it is filled with tales of those who risked and struggled and beat the odds because they knew that this is a place   perhaps the only place   where such triumph is always possible  because they believe that the pursuit of happiness is not just a phrase in a declaration  but the founding promise of our country   a promise that sustained our parents and grandparents through war and depression  racial and social strife  heartache and hardship  it's a promise that sustains this generation still  the other day we heard from a young man named joshua stroman who's from right here in south carolina  joshua never knew his father  and when he was very young  his mom and stepfather both died from cancer  he was then taken in by family members who were involved with gangs and drugs  he experimented with that lifestyle for a bit  and his low point came when he went to jail at eighteen years old  that's when he decided that his story would have a different ending  he began to find comfort in his faith  and when he left jail  he moved in with an aunt who expected him to behave well and study hard  and he did  he is now at benedict college and will be president of the student council there next year  but he told us that of everything that's out there  his biggest dream is to someday stand in the front yard of his own home with his wife and kids  who will hug him and say   i love you  daddy  it's a dream that could not be simpler or more profound   a dream that  in some form or another  has probably animated the journey that so many fathers and mothers and young men like josh have taken over the generations  he has turned his life around because he held close the belief that it was always within reach  now it is our task to turn this country around so that we can prove to him and so many others that they were right all along  i look forward to working with all of you in making this happen  thank you   em as prepared for delivery em "], ["obama1", "i have been running for president now for a little more than six months  and everywhere we've gone we've seen these huge crowds just like this one  we saw   in iowa city    in austin    in atlanta  it's not just the numbers themselves that are so inspiring  it's the people behind those numbers  they're young and old  black and white  latino  asian  and native american  they're democrats and independents and more than a few republicans  many are showing up to the very first political event of their lifetime  the conventional thinking in washington tells us that we're a country divided into red states and blue states  that we're doomed to fight the same tired partisan battles over and over again  they tell us we can't come together to take on big challenges like health care  or energy  or education  that we can't agree on what america should be  so we might as well settle for the way america is right now  but these crowds tell me something else  they tell me that when it comes to what's wrong with this country  the american people are not the problem  the american people are the answer  we're here today   you and i   because we believe in what this country can be  in the face of war  we believe there can be peace  in the face of despair  we believe there can be hope  in the face of a politics that's shut us out  that's told us to settle  that's divided us for too long  we believe we can be one people  reaching for what's possible  building that more perfect union  that's why we're here  we know we need a new direction  and that change begins with an end to the bush cheney administration  their years haven't just been bad years for democrats  they've been bad years for america  we've seen the triumph of ideology over reason  of cronyism over competence  we've seen the constitution of the united states treated as a nuisance instead of the founding document of our democracy  we've seen policies that have widened the divide between wall street and main street and marginalized organized labor at a time when american workers need a voice most  we've seen fellow citizens abandoned on rooftops after a storm  and we've seen a disastrous war in iraq that should never have been authorized and never been waged  but we also know that  as bad as george bush has been  it's going to take more than a change of parties in the white house to truly turn this country around  george bush and dick cheney may have turned divisive  special interest politics into an art form  but they didn't invent it  it was there before they got to washington  and if you and i don't stand up and challenge it  it will be there long after they leave  and so we face a choice in this election  do we continue the cynical math that says it's a winning strategy to divide our country in two  and simply ignore the half that doesn't agree  or do we find our stake in each other as americans  united again by a sense of common purpose and a common destiny  do we continue the conventional washington thinking on foreign policy that led us to this tragic war in iraq  or do we recognize the challenges of a new world  and engage with friends and foes in a way that restores america's moral leadership and security  do we continue to allow lobbyists to veto our progress  or do we finally put our national interests ahead of the special interests  and address the concerns people feel over their jobs  their health care and their children's future  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  because to meet america's challenges  changing parties isn't change enough  we need something new  we need to turn the page  there are those who tout their experience working the system in washington   but the problem is that the system in washington isn't working for us and hasn't for a long time  think about it  we've been talking about the health care crisis in this country for decades  yet through democratic and republican administrations we've failed to act  and you know why   because the drug and insurance industry has spent over a billion dollars on lobbying in the past ten years alone to block reform  we've heard promises of energy independence for decades  yet every year  the oil and gas lobbyists use their clout and their money to keep us addicted to fossil fuels  too many in washington see politics as a game  and that is why i believe this election cannot be about who can play this game better  it has to be about who can put an end to the game playing  the times are too serious  the stakes are too high  and the change that's required  this new spirit of responsibility and honesty  of seriousness and sacrifice  starts with you  it starts with millions of people across this country  coming together to demand something better  i have never seen politics as a game  from the day i decided to become a community organizer on the south side of chicago over two decades ago  i have always seen politics as a mission   as the way we hold this country up to our highest ideals  and when we've fallen short of those ideals  it's this sense of mission that has compelled americans of all backgrounds and beliefs to put aside their differences and push their shoulder against the wheel of history in search of a better day  it's this sense of mission that led my grandfather to enlist after pearl harbor and sent my grandmother to a bomber assembly line  it's what led thousands of young people i'll never know to sit at lunch counters and brave fire hoses so that we all might be free  it's what led my father to keep writing letters until someone answered his prayer and gave him his ticket to america  and it's what led me to those poor neighborhoods in chicago  so that i could do my part to help folks who had lost jobs and lost hope when the local steel plant closed  it's politics as a mission  and if you don't spend your whole life in washington  it becomes easier to remember what this means  the other day i got head to out to california because the service employees' union had organized an event where i would walk in the shoes of one of their members for a day  and so i woke up at five a m  and met up with this sixty one year old woman named pauline beck who was a home care worker  every day of her life she wakes up and she takes care of two foster children who do not have a family of their own  then she goes to work and she takes care of an eighty seven year old amputee  and so i went with her to work  and we scrubbed the floors and we did the laundry and cleaned the rooms  it was one of the best days i've had on the campaign so far  because it reminded me of what we're doing here  listening to this humble woman talk about the hardships of her life without a trace of self pity  glad she could be of some service to somebody  just wanting a little bit more pay to take care of those kids  a little more security for her retirement  maybe a day off once in awhile to rest her tired back  i was reminded that for all the noise and the pettiness coming out of washington  what holds this country together is this fundamental belief that we all have a stake in each other   that i am my brother's keeper  that i am my sister's keeper  and that must express itself not only in our churches and synagogues or in our personal lives  but in our government too  now  when the folks in washington hear me speak  this is usually when they start rolling their eyes   oh  there he goes talking about hope again  he's so naive  he's a hope peddler  he's a hope monger  well i stand guilty as charged  i am hopeful about america  apparently the pundits consider this a chronic condition  a symptom of a lack of experience  i used to wonder what they meant  this whole experience argument  because i've been fighting for people as a public servant for over two decades   as a community organizer  a civil rights lawyer  a constitutional law professor  a state senator  and a u s  senator  but then i came to realize that to this bunch  only the years you spend in washington count  only time in washington translates into wisdom  i think they are wrong about that  recent history suggests otherwise  there were a couple of guys named cheney and rumsfeld who had two of the longest resumes in washington and they led us into the worst foreign policy fiasco in our history  time served doesn't guarantee judgment  a resume does nothing about character  so let me tell you about a different kind of experience   the experience i bring to this race  my experience tells me that real change and progress comes not by dividing  but by bringing people together to get things done   like when i worked with police officers and civil rights advocates to reform a death penalty system that had sent thirteen innocent people in illinois to death row  or when i worked with republicans and democrats to expand health care for   illinoisans  or put   million worth of tax cuts in the pockets of working families  or when i worked with my republican colleague  dick lugar  to pass a law securing dangerous weapons in the old soviet union  my experience tells me that real change and reform come when we're willing to put the people's interests before the special interests and partisan interests  that's what i did in illinois when i took on money in politics and passed the first ethics reform in twenty five years  and that's what i did in washington when i passed a law that earned me the cold shoulder from leaders of both parties   for the first time in history  washington lobbyists will have to disclose who they're raising money from and who in congress they're funneling it to  my experience tells me that real change and security come when we're willing to make foreign policy decisions based not on what's popular in washington  but what's right for america   based on a real understanding of the world  that's why i resisted the tide in my campaign for the us senate and opposed the war in iraq from the start  as we saw then  longevity in washington is no guarantee of good judgment  so let's be clear   there are a lot of people who have been in washington longer than me  who have better connections and go to the right dinner parties and know how to talk the washington talk  well i might not have the experience washington likes  but i believe i have the experience america needs right now  hope and change are not just the rhetoric of a campaign for me  hope and change have been the causes of my life  hope and change are the story of our country  and we're here today to continue that story  we're here to infuse the old washington politics with a new sense of mission   to unite people around a common purpose  to rally americans around a common destiny  we aren't just here to win an election  we are here to transform a nation  i do not accept that in the richest nation on earth we have to stand by while   million americans have no health care and millions more are on the verge of bankruptcy because of their medical bills  my mother died of ovarian cancer in the prime of her life and do you know what she was most worried about in those final months  she was between jobs when she was diagnosed and she wasn't sure whether insurance would cover her treatment  so i know what it's like to see a loved one suffer because of a broken health care system  i know that it's wrong  and i know that's not who we are  when i am president  we will have universal health care in this country by the end of my first term in office  it's a plan that will cover every american and cut the cost of a typical family's premiums by   a year  and i will not let the drug and insurance companies spend another billion dollars to block reform   because people like my mother shouldn't have to worry about bankruptcy every time they get sick  we're better than that  i do not accept that we have to keep sending   million a day to hostile nations because of our addiction to foreign oil   a dependency that fuels both sides of the war on terror and is melting the polar ice caps in the bargain  we can meet our moral obligation to future generations and halt the march of global warming  i have a plan to raise our fuel standards that's won the support of some lawmakers who had never supported raising fuel standards before  and i didn't just give a speech about it in front of some environmental audience in california   i went right to detroit and said it in front of a group of automakers  now i have to admit   the room was pretty quiet  but i did it because i don't think we're going to get anywhere in this country by just telling everyone what they want to hear  we have to tell people what they need to hear  we have to tell people the truth  and you shouldn't expect anything less from your president  i don't accept that we can't give every single child in america a world class education  we know countries that out teach us today will out compete us tomorrow  but it's bigger than that  the america we believe in isn't a country where millions of children are robbed of their opportunity by failing schools  and the answer isn't just a snappy slogan  to truly leave no child behind  we have to make a genuine commitment to educational opportunity for all  from cradle to adulthood  this country should be focusing on the most important part of any child's achievement   the person standing at the front of the classroom  as president  i will launch a campaign to recruit an army of new teachers  and we'll pay them better  and give them more support  and help them reach high standards by working with them  not working against them  i will invest in early childhood education so that every child has the best possible start in life  and while we're at it  let's finally make a college degree affordable and available to every american  and bolster our community colleges to help educate and train america's workers  we can do that  i do not accept that the american dream is a thing of the past  on this labor day  let's give american workers more than a parade  let's give them policies that actually value their work  let's provide them with a living wage  let's allow our unions do what they do best again   organize our workers and lift up our middle class  and let's stop giving tax breaks to the companies who send them overseas and start giving them to companies who create jobs right here in america  we can do this  finally  i do not accept an america that has lost its moral standing in the community of nations  today there is no greater mission than keeping america safe and restoring america's image in the world  that starts with ending this war  i opposed the war in iraq from the start  i said then that iraq was the wrong battlefield  that we would find ourselves mired in a lengthy civil war  diverting our attention from al qaeda in afghanistan  and i introduced a plan back in january that would have gradually and responsibly removed all combat troops from iraq by march  th    the president vetoed a plan just like this last spring  but we will be debating the war again next week  now is the time to keep the pressure on all those republican senators and congressmen who continue to support the president's failed course  we can end this war without george bush  and if we don't  then it will be the first thing i do as president of the united states  but the change that is needed extends beyond ending the war  to repair the damage  to meet the dangers and seize the opportunities of this new century  the old formulas will not do  we need to turn the page on the bush cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like  that doesn't make us look tough  it makes us look arrogant  i'm not afraid that i'll lose a propaganda battle with a bunch of dictators  strong countries and strong presidents shouldn't be afraid to talk to our adversaries to tell them where america stands  that's why i will   because that's how tough  principled and smart diplomacy works  i want to go before the united nations as president and say   america's back  it's time for america to lead again  it's time to fight on the right battlefield in rooting out al qaeda  it's time to lead by building schools in the middle east that teach math and science instead of hatred  it's time for us to close guantanamo and restore the right of habeas corpus  it's time to show the world that we are not a country that ships prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries  that we are not a country that looks away while innocents are slaughtered in darfur  that we are not a country that runs prisons which lock people away without ever telling them why they are there or what they are charged with  that is not who we are  we are the last  best hope of earth  we are the nation that liberated a continent from a madman  that lifted ourselves from the depths of depression  that won civil rights  and women's rights  and voting rights for all our people  we are the beacon that has led generations of weary travelers to find opportunity  and liberty  and hope on our doorstep  that's who we are  and that's who we can be again  i am reminded every single day that i am not a perfect man  i will not be a perfect president  but i can promise you this   i will always tell you what i think and where i stand  i will be honest with you about the challenges we face  i will listen to you when we disagree  and most importantly  i will open the doors of government and ask you to be involved in your own democracy again  i know what i'm asking is hard  i know that politics and politicians have disappointed you so many times before  to the point where sometimes it seems easier to just tune out and walk away  but what you have to remember is that when you walk away  the same old politics wins every time  that's what all the people who benefit from politics as a game are counting on  that's why we need you  that's why i can't do this alone  i am not just asking you to trust in my ability to change this country   i'm asking you to trust in yourself  in your own instincts  in your own sense of possibility  in your own sense of what's right  i'm asking you to bet on us  on our capacity to do what previous generations have done   to lift our sights  to join together and forge a better future for our children and grandchildren  make this campaign the vehicle for your hopes and your dreams  for your sense of what america is and what america can be  and if you're willing to work for it and fight for it and bring others to this cause  if after this rally you decide to go sign up twenty more people or volunteer to knock on doors or serve as a precinct captain  then i believe that this time will finally be different from all the rest  and so i'm asking you   if you believe it's time to challenge the washington politics that have let us down and shut us out and made us settle  if you believe it's time to restore a sense of mission to our politics and a sense of possibility to america  if you want a country that no longer sees itself as a collection of red states and blue states  if you want a president who can lead a united states of america  then i ask you to believe in this campaign  i ask you to believe in yourself  i ask you to believe again in the dream that we call america   em as prepared for delivery em "], ["obama1", "it's wonderful to be here today  i feel right at home in bettendorf  which is just a stone's throw from my home state of illinois  but the truth is  we share more than the banks of a great river  if you spend time in washington  you hear a lot about the divisions in our country  about how we're becoming more separated by geography and ideology  race and religion  wealth and opportunity  and we've had plenty of politicians who try to take advantage of these divisions   pitting americans against one another  or targeting different messages to different audiences  but as i've traveled around iowa and the rest of the country these last nine months  i haven't been struck by our differences   i've been impressed by the values and hopes that we share  in big cities and small towns  among men and women  young and old  black  white  and brown   americans share a faith in simple dreams  a job with wages that can support a family  health care that we can count on and afford  a retirement that is dignified and secure  education and opportunity for our kids  common hopes  american dreams  these are dreams that drove my grandparents  after my grandfather served in world war ii  the gi bill gave him a chance to go to college  and the government gave them a chance to buy a home  they moved west  worked hard at different jobs  and were able to provide my mother with a decent education  to help raise me  and to save enough to retire  these are dreams that drove my father in law  a city worker in chicago  he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of   but every day  even when he had to leave an hour earlier in the morning and rely on a walker to get him there  he went to work while his wife stayed home with the kids  and on that single salary  he provided for his family and sent my wife michelle and her brother to college  his dream was to see them do better  and they have  these are dreams that drove my mother  a single mom   even while relying on food stamps as she finished her education  she followed her passion for helping others  and raised my sister and me to believe that in america there are no barriers to success   no matter what color you are  no matter where you're from  no matter how much money you have  and these are the dreams that led me to chicago over two decades ago to become a community organizer  the salary     a year   wasn't what my friends would make in the corporate world or at law firms  i didn't know a single person in chicago  but i knew there were folks who needed help  the steel plant had closed  jobs were disappearing  in a forgotten corner of america  the american dream was slipping away  and i knew dreams are worth fighting for  what is unique about america is that we want these dreams for more than ourselves   we want them for each other  that's why we call it the american dream  we want it for the kid who doesn't go to college because she cannot afford it  for the worker whose wondering if his wages will pay this winter's heating bill  for   million americans living without health care  for the millions more who worry if they have enough to retire with the dignity they have earned  when our fellow americans are denied the american dream  our own dreams are diminished  and today  the cost of that dream is rising faster than ever before  while some have prospered beyond imagination in this global economy  middle class americans   as well as those working hard to become middle class   are seeing the american dream slip further and further away  you know it from your own lives  americans are working harder for less and paying more for health care and college  for most folks  one income isn't enough to raise a family and send your kids to college  sometimes  two incomes aren't enough  it's harder to save  it's harder to retire  you're doing your part  you're meeting your responsibilities  but it always seems like you're treading water or falling behind  and as i see this every day on the campaign trail  i'm reminded of how unlikely it is that the dreams of my family could be realized today i don't accept this future  we need to reclaim the american dream  and that starts with reclaiming the white house from george bush and dick cheney  we're tired of tax cuts for the wealthy that shift the burden onto the backs of working people  we're tired of waiting ten years for the minimum wage to go up while ceo pay is soaring  we're tired of more americans going without health care  of more americans falling into poverty  of more american kids who have the brains and the drive to go to college   but can't   because they can't afford it  we're ready for the bush administration to end  because we are sick and tired of being sick and tired  but this is about more than george bush  he's just the beginning of the change that we need  these problems didn't start when he came to office and they won't end just because he's leaving  we're not going to reclaim that dream unless we put an end to the politics of polarization and division that is holding this country back  unless we stand up to the corporate lobbyists that have stood in the way of progress  unless we have leadership that doesn't just tell people what they want to hear   but tells everyone what they need to know  that's the change we need  i believe that americans want to come together again behind a common purpose  americans want to reclaim our american dream  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  it's the same reason i packed up my car and moved to chicago  because in this country  that dream is worth fighting for   not just for ourselves  but for each other  and that's why i don't think you should settle for a president who's only there for you when it's easy or convenient or popular   i think you deserve a president who you can trust will fight for your dreams every hour of every day for the next four years  that's the change we need  this starts with an economy that works for working people  americans don't expect government to solve all our problems  but you're tired of a government that works for special interests  and not for you  it's time that we had leadership that worried as much about main street as it does about wall street  that's why i'm introducing an american dream agenda   to put some wind at the backs of working people  to lower the cost of getting ahead  and to protect and extend opportunity for the middle class  we need to give working families a break  for twenty five years  we've seen gaps in wealth grow larger  while our tax code that favors wealth over work  that's why i've proposed an income tax cut to offset the payroll tax that working americans are already paying  this will be worth up to   for a working family  i'll make retirement more secure for america's seniors by eliminating income taxes for any retiree making less than   per year  and i won't wait ten years to raise the minimum wage   i'll guarantee that it goes up every single year  that's the change that working americans need  we know that the cost of the american dream must never come at the expense of the american family  you're working longer hours  more families have two parents working  meanwhile  it's hard to get a hand  it's even harder to get a break  that's why i'll double spending on quality after school programs   so that you can know your kids are safe and secure  and that's why i'll expand the family medical leave act to include more businesses and millions more workers  to let parents participate in school activities with their kids  and to cover elderly care  and we'll finally put federal support behind state efforts to provide paid family and medical leave  we also need to change a system that is stacked against women  forty percent of working women do not have a single paid sick day  more and more women are denied jobs or promotions because they've got kids at home  as the son of a single mother  that is not the america that i believe in  i'll be a president who stands up for working parents  we'll require employers to provide seven paid sick days each year  we'll enforce laws that prohibit caregiver discrimination  and we'll encourage flexible work schedules to better balance work and parenting for mothers and fathers  that's the change that working families need  we also need a housing market that is honest  open and accountable  i've introduced a bill in the senate that cracks down on mortgage fraud  as president  i'll get tough on enforcement and raise penalties on lenders who have broken the rules  for homeowners facing foreclosure through no fault of their own  we'll create a fund and reform bankruptcy laws to give them a shot at avoiding foreclosure  we'll mandate that prospective homebuyers have access to accurate and complete information about their mortgage options  and we'll give middle class homeowners added relief by providing a tax credit that covers   percent of a family's mortgage interest payment each year  that's the change that america's homeowners need  since many people who hold subprime mortgages are shifting their debt to credit cards  we have to make sure that they understand their commitments   otherwise credit cards could be the next stage in the subprime crisis  to make sure that americans know what they're signing up for  i'll institute a five star rating system to inform consumers about the level of risk involved in every credit card  and we'll establish a credit card bill of rights that will ban unilateral changes to a credit card agreement  ban rate changes to debt that's already incurred  and ban interest on late fees  americans need to pay what they owe  but they should pay what's fair  this same principle of fairness is needed in our bankruptcy laws  for far too long  the same politicians in washington who have been cutting back the safety net for working people have been protecting golden parachutes for the well off   so workers lose their pensions and their health care  while ceos get multi million dollar payoffs  i fought against a bankruptcy reform bill in the senate that did more to protect credit card companies and banks than to help working people  i'll continue the fight for good bankruptcy laws as president  no more bonuses for executives while pensions disappear  we'll press firms to put more money into their pension funds  and require firms to disclose their pension fund investments  and we'll increase the amount of wages and benefits that workers can claim in bankruptcy court  that's the change we need in our bankruptcy laws  and if you can demonstrate that you went bankrupt because of medical expenses  then there must be a process that relieves that debt and lets you get back on your feet  i don't accept an america where we let someone go over a cliff just because they get sick  that is not who we are  every four years politicians come before you to talk about health care  you hear the same promises  and then you see the same results  well it's time to end the outrage of   million uninsured americans  it's time to finally do something about it  i reformed health care in illinois  and i didn't do it alone   i did it by reaching out to democrats and republicans  we took on the insurance industry  and we won  that's how i'll pass a universal health care bill that cuts a typical family's premiums by up to   and mark my words   i will sign this bill by the end of my first term as president  that's the change that america is waiting for  and health care isn't the only cost that we're not keeping up with  americans who work hard their entire lives have earned a secure retirement  but right now  we've got   million working people in this country who don't have employer based retirement plans  personal saving is at an all time low  a part of the american dream is at risk  that's why i'll establish an automatic workplace pension policy  employers will be required to enroll workers in a direct deposit retirement account that places a small percentage of each paycheck into the account  then you'll have the choice of opting out  matching  or adding to this account  when you change jobs  your savings will roll over into your new employer's system  or into a system that you control if you leave the workplace or become self employed  and the federal government will match savings for working families  this will dramatically increase the number of americans who save for retirement  and lift up the amount of savings in this country  that's the change we need to help americans achieve the retirement they are working for  but we need to do more than put the american dream on a firmer foundation  every american has the right to pursue their dreams  but we also have the responsibility to make sure that our children can reach a little further and rise a little higher than we did  when i am president  we will stop passing bills called no child left behind that leave the money behind  and start making real investments in education  that means early childhood education  that means recruiting an army of new teachers  and paying them better  and supporting them more so they're not just teaching to test  but teaching to teach  it also means putting a college education within reach of every american  that's the best investment we can make in our future  i'll create a new and fully refundable tax credit worth   for tuition and fees every year  which will cover two thirds of the tuition at the average public college or university  i'll also simplify the financial aid application process so that we don't have a million students who aren't applying for aid because it's too difficult  i will start by eliminating the current student aid form altogether   we'll use tax data instead  and i'll tap the tremendous resource of community colleges  which educate half the undergraduates in this country  by creating a new community college partnership program  we'll help schools determine what skills and technical education are needed to help local industry  we'll expand new degrees for emerging fields  and we'll reward schools that graduate more students  that's the change we need so that our young people can achieve their dreams  this is what we must do to reclaim the american dream  we know it won't be easy  we'll hear from the can't do  won't do  won't even try crowd in washington  the special interests and their lobbyists  the conventional thinking that says this country is just too divided to make progress  well i'm not running for president to conform to this conventional thinking   i'm running to challenge it  there is too much at stake  too much at stake for the family that can't get ahead  the elderly worker who faces a retirement filled with worry  the kid who doesn't believe america has a place for her dreams  to stand up for these americans  i don't want to settle for anything less than real change  fundamental change   change we need   change that we can believe in  it's change that i've been fighting for since i moved out to chicago over two decades ago  because those dreams   american dreams   are worth fighting for  and because i wouldn't be standing on this stage today if it weren't for the dreams of those who came before me  the dreams of my grandfather   who marched in patton's army and moved his family west in search of opportunity  the dreams of my grandmother   who was up at dawn and worked twice as hard at her job because a woman had to work harder to get ahead  the dreams of my father who crossed an ocean because america offered that light to the world  the dreams of my mother   a single mom who understood that a life rich in family and experience was more important than a life of riches  the dreams of those men and women on the south side of chicago  who fought with me to create a future for their community after the steel plant was shuttered  there has been a lot of talk in this campaign about the politics of hope  but the politics of hope doesn't mean hoping that things come easy  it's a politics of believing in things unseen  of believing in what this country might be  and of standing up for that belief and fighting for it when it's hard  america is the sum of our dreams  and what binds us together  what makes us one american family  is that we stand up and fight for each other's dreams  that we reaffirm that fundamental belief   i am my brother's keeper  i am my sister's keeper   through our politics  our policies  and in our daily lives  it's time to do that once more  it's time to reclaim the american dream "], ["obama1", "the scripture tells us that when joshua and the israelites arrived at the gates of jericho  they could not enter  the walls of the city were too steep for any one person to climb  too strong to be taken down with brute force  and so they sat for days  unable to pass on through  but god had a plan for his people  he told them to stand together and march together around the city  and on the seventh day he told them that when they heard the sound of the ram's horn  they should speak with one voice  and at the chosen hour  when the horn sounded and a chorus of voices cried out together  the mighty walls of jericho came tumbling down  there are many lessons to take from this passage  just as there are many lessons to take from this day  just as there are many memories that fill the space of this church  as i was thinking about which ones we need to remember at this hour  my mind went back to the very beginning of the modern civil rights era  because before memphis and the mountaintop  before the bridge in selma and the march on washington  before birmingham and the beatings  the fire hoses and the loss of those four little girls  before there was king the icon and his magnificent dream  there was king the young preacher and a people who found themselves suffering under the yoke of oppression  and on the eve of the bus boycotts in montgomery  at a time when many were still doubtful about the possibilities of change  a time when those in the black community mistrusted themselves  and at times mistrusted each other  king inspired with words not of anger  but of an urgency that still speaks to us today   unity is the great need of the hour  is what king said  unity is how we shall overcome  what dr  king understood is that if just one person chose to walk instead of ride the bus  those walls of oppression would not be moved  but maybe if a few more walked  the foundation might start to shake  if a few more women were willing to do what rosa parks had done  maybe the cracks would start to show  if teenagers took freedom rides from north to south  maybe a few bricks would come loose  maybe if white folks marched because they had come to understand that their freedom too was at stake in the impending battle  the wall would begin to sway  and if enough americans were awakened to the injustice  if they joined together  north and south  rich and poor  christian and jew  then perhaps that wall would come tumbling down  and justice would flow like water  and righteousness like a mighty stream  unity is the great need of the hour   the great need of this hour  not because it sounds pleasant or because it makes us feel good  but because it's the only way we can overcome the essential deficit that exists in this country  i'm not talking about a budget deficit  i'm not talking about a trade deficit  i'm not talking about a deficit of good ideas or new plans  i'm talking about a moral deficit  i'm talking about an empathy deficit  i'm taking about an inability to recognize ourselves in one another  to understand that we are our brother's keeper  we are our sister's keeper  that  in the words of dr  king  we are all tied together in a single garment of destiny  we have an empathy deficit when we're still sending our children down corridors of shame   schools in the forgotten corners of america where the color of your skin still affects the content of your education  we have a deficit when ceos are making more in ten minutes than some workers make in ten months  when families lose their homes so that lenders make a profit  when mothers can't afford a doctor when their children get sick  we have a deficit in this country when there is scooter libby justice for some and jena justice for others  when our children see nooses hanging from a schoolyard tree today  in the present  in the twenty first century  we have a deficit when homeless veterans sleep on the streets of our cities  when innocents are slaughtered in the deserts of darfur  when young americans serve tour after tour of duty in a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged  and we have a deficit when it takes a breach in our levees to reveal a breach in our compassion  when it takes a terrible storm to reveal the hungry that god calls on us to feed  the sick he calls on us to care for  the least of these he commands that we treat as our own  so we have a deficit to close  we have walls   barriers to justice and equality   that must come down  and to do this  we know that unity is the great need of this hour  unfortunately  all too often when we talk about unity in this country  we've come to believe that it can be purchased on the cheap  we've come to believe that racial reconciliation can come easily   that it's just a matter of a few ignorant people trapped in the prejudices of the past  and that if the demagogues and those who exploit our racial divisions will simply go away  then all our problems would be solved  all too often  we seek to ignore the profound institutional barriers that stand in the way of ensuring opportunity for all children  or decent jobs for all people  or health care for those who are sick  we long for unity  but are unwilling to pay the price  but of course  true unity cannot be so easily won  it starts with a change in attitudes   a broadening of our minds  and a broadening of our hearts  it's not easy to stand in somebody else's shoes  it's not easy to see past our differences  we've all encountered this in our own lives  but what makes it even more difficult is that we have a politics in this country that seeks to drive us apart   that puts up walls between us  we are told that those who differ from us on a few things are different from us on all things  that our problems are the fault of those who don't think like us or look like us or come from where we do  the welfare queen is taking our tax money  the immigrant is taking our jobs  the believer condemns the non believer as immoral  and the non believer chides the believer as intolerant  for most of this country's history  we in the african american community have been at the receiving end of man's inhumanity to man  and all of us understand intimately the insidious role that race still sometimes plays   on the job  in the schools  in our health care system  and in our criminal justice system  and yet  if we are honest with ourselves  we must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean  if we're honest with ourselves  we'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to king's vision of a beloved community  we have scorned our gay brothers and sisters instead of embracing them  the scourge of anti semitism has  at times  revealed itself in our community  for too long  some of us have seen immigrants as competitors for jobs instead of companions in the fight for opportunity  every day  our politics fuels and exploits this kind of division across all races and regions  across gender and party  it is played out on television  it is sensationalized by the media  and last week  it even crept into the campaign for president  with charges and counter charges that served to obscure the issues instead of illuminating the critical choices we face as a nation  so let us say that on this day of all days  each of us carries with us the task of changing our hearts and minds  the division  the stereotypes  the scape goating  the ease with which we blame our plight on others   all of this distracts us from the common challenges we face   war and poverty  injustice and inequality  we can no longer afford to build ourselves up by tearing someone else down  we can no longer afford to traffic in lies or fear or hate  it is the poison that we must purge from our politics  the wall that we must tear down before the hour grows too late  because if dr  king could love his jailor  if he could call on the faithful who once sat where you do to forgive those who set dogs and fire hoses upon them  then surely we can look past what divides us in our time  and bind up our wounds  and erase the empathy deficit that exists in our hearts  but if changing our hearts and minds is the first critical step  we cannot stop there  it is not enough to bemoan the plight of poor children in this country and remain unwilling to push our elected officials to provide the resources to fix our schools  it is not enough to decry the disparities of health care and yet allow the insurance companies and the drug companies to block much needed reforms  it is not enough for us to abhor the costs of a misguided war  and yet allow ourselves to be driven by a politics of fear that sees the threat of attack as way to scare up votes instead of a call to come together around a common effort  the scripture tells us that we are judged not just by word  but by deed  and if we are to truly bring about the unity that is so crucial in this time  we must find it within ourselves to act on what we know  to understand that living up to this country's ideals and its possibilities will require great effort and resources  sacrifice and stamina  and that is what is at stake in the great political debate we are having today  the changes that are needed are not just a matter of tinkering at the edges  and they will not come if politicians simply tell us what we want to hear  all of us will be called upon to make some sacrifice  none of us will be exempt from responsibility  we will have to fight to fix our schools  but we will also have to challenge ourselves to be better parents  we will have to confront the biases in our criminal justice system  but we will also have to acknowledge the deep seated violence that still resides in our own communities and marshal the will to break its grip  that is how we will bring about the change we seek  that is how dr  king led this country through the wilderness  he did it with words   words that he spoke not just to the children of slaves  but the children of slave owners  words that inspired not just black but also white  not just the christian but the jew  not just the southerner but also the northerner  he led with words  but he also led with deeds  he also led by example  he led by marching and going to jail and suffering threats and being away from his family  he led by taking a stand against a war  knowing full well that it would diminish his popularity  he led by challenging our economic structures  understanding that it would cause discomfort  dr  king understood that unity cannot be won on the cheap  that we would have to earn it through great effort and determination  that is the unity   the hard earned unity   that we need right now  it is that effort  and that determination  that can transform blind optimism into hope   the hope to imagine  and work for  and fight for what seemed impossible before  the stories that give me such hope don't happen in the spotlight  they don't happen on the presidential stage  they happen in the quiet corners of our lives  they happen in the moments we least expect  let me give you an example of one of those stories  there is a young  twenty three year old white woman named ashley baia who organizes for our campaign in florence  south carolina  she's been working to organize a mostly african american community since the beginning of this campaign  and the other day she was at a roundtable discussion where everyone went around telling their story and why they were there  and ashley said that when she was nine years old  her mother got cancer  and because she had to miss days of work  she was let go and lost her health care  they had to file for bankruptcy  and that's when ashley decided that she had to do something to help her mom  she knew that food was one of their most expensive costs  and so ashley convinced her mother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and relish sandwiches  because that was the cheapest way to eat  she did this for a year until her mom got better  and she told everyone at the roundtable that the reason she joined our campaign was so that she could help the millions of other children in the country who want and need to help their parents too  so ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else why they're supporting the campaign  they all have different stories and reasons  many bring up a specific issue  and finally they come to this elderly black man who's been sitting there quietly the entire time  and ashley asks him why he's there  and he does not bring up a specific issue  he does not say health care or the economy  he does not say education or the war  he does not say that he was there because of barack obama  he simply says to everyone in the room   i am here because of ashley  by itself  that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that old black man is not enough  it is not enough to give health care to the sick  or jobs to the jobless  or education to our children  but it is where we begin  it is why the walls in that room began to crack and shake  and if they can shake in that room  they can shake in atlanta  and if they can shake in atlanta  they can shake in georgia  and if they can shake in georgia  they can shake all across america  and if enough of our voices join together  we can bring those walls tumbling down  the walls of jericho can finally come tumbling down  that is our hope   but only if we pray together  and work together  and march together  brothers and sisters  we cannot walk alone  in the struggle for peace and justice  we cannot walk alone  in the struggle for opportunity and equality  we cannot walk alone in the struggle to heal this nation and repair this world  we cannot walk alone  so i ask you to walk with me  and march with me  and join your voice with mine  and together we will sing the song that tears down the walls that divide us  and lift up an america that is truly indivisible  with liberty  and justice  for all  may god bless the memory of the great pastor of this church  and may god bless the united states of america "], ["obama1", "today  the change we seek swept through the chesapeake and over the potomac  we won the state of maryland  we won the commonwealth of virginia  and though we won in washington d c  this movement won't stop until there's change in washington  and tonight  we're on our way  but we know how much farther we have to go  we know it takes more than one night   or even one election   to overcome decades of money and the influence  bitter partisanship and petty bickering that's shut you out  let you down and told you to settle  we know our road will not be easy  but we also know that at this moment the cynics can no longer say our hope is false  we have now won east and west  north and south  and across the heartland of this country we love  we have given young people a reason to believe  and brought folks back to the polls who want to believe again  and we are bringing together democrats and independents and republicans  blacks and whites  latinos and asians  small states and big states  red states and blue states into a united states of america  this is the new american majority  this is what change looks like when it happens from the bottom up  and in this election  your voices will be heard  because at a time when so many people are struggling to keep up with soaring costs in a sluggish economy  we know that the status quo in washington just won't do  not this time  not this year  we can't keep playing the same washington game with the same washington players and expect a different result   because it's a game that ordinary americans are losing  it's a game where lobbyists write check after check and exxon turns record profits  while you pay the price at the pump  and our planet is put at risk  that's what happens when lobbyists set the agenda  and that's why they won't drown out your voices anymore when i am president of the united states of america  it's a game where trade deals like nafta ship jobs overseas and force parents to compete with their teenagers to work for minimum wage at wal mart  that's what happens when the american worker doesn't have a voice at the negotiating table  when leaders change their positions on trade with the politics of the moment  and that's why we need a president who will listen to main street   not just wall street  a president who will stand with workers not just when it's easy  but when it's hard  it's a game where democrats and republicans fail to come together year after year after year  while another mother goes without health care for her sick child  that's why we have to put an end to the division and distraction in washington  so that we can unite this nation around a common purpose  a higher purpose  it's a game where the only way for democrats to look tough on national security is by talking  and acting and voting like bush mccain republicans  while our troops are sent to fight tour after tour of duty in a war that should've never been authorized and should've never been waged  that's what happens when we use   to scare up votes  and that's why we need to do more than end a war   we need to end the mindset that got us into war  that's the choice in this primary  it's about whether we choose to play the game  or whether we choose to end it  it's change that polls well  or change we can believe in  it's the past versus the future  and when i'm the democratic nominee for president   that will be the choice in november  john mccain is an american hero  we honor his service to our nation  but his priorities don't address the real problems of the american people  because they are bound to the failed policies of the past  george bush won't be on the ballot this november  but his war and his tax cuts for the wealthy will  when i am the nominee  i will offer a clear choice  john mccain won't be able to say that i ever supported this war in iraq  because i opposed it from the beginning  senator mccain said the other day that we might be mired for a hundred years in iraq  which is reason enough to not give him four years in the white house  if we had chosen a different path  the right path  we could have finished the job in afghanistan  and put more resources into the fight against bin laden  and instead of spending hundreds of billions of dollars in baghdad  we could have put that money into our schools and hospitals  our road and bridges   and that's what the american people need us to do right now  and i admired senator mccain when he stood up and said that it offended his  conscience  to support the bush tax cuts for the wealthy in a time of war  that he couldn't support a tax cut where  so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate  but somewhere along the road to the republican nomination  the straight talk express lost its wheels  because now he's all for them  well i'm not  we can't keep spending money that we don't have in a war that we shouldn't have fought  we can't keep mortgaging our children's future on a mountain of debt  we can't keep driving a wider and wider gap between the few who are rich and the rest who struggle to keep pace  it's time to turn the page  we need a new direction in this country  everywhere i go  i meet americans who can't wait another day for change  they're not just showing up to hear a speech   they need to know that politics can make a difference in their lives  that it's not too late to reclaim the american dream  it's a dream shared in big cities and small towns  across races  regions and religions   that if you work hard  you can support a family  that if you get sick  there will be health care you can afford  that you can retire with the dignity and security and respect that you have earned  that your kids can get a good education  and young people can go to college even if they're not rich  that is our common hope  that is the american dream  it's the dream of the father who goes to work before dawn and lies awake at night wondering how he's going to pay the bills  he needs us to restore fairness to our economy by putting a tax cut into the pockets of working people  and seniors  and struggling homeowners  it's the dream of the woman who told me she works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't afford health care for a sister who's ill  she needs us to finally come together to make health care affordable and available for every american  it's the dream of the senior i met who lost his pension when the company he gave his life to went bankrupt  he doesn't need bankruptcy laws that protect banks and big lenders  he needs us to protect pensions  not ceo bonuses  and to do what it takes to make sure that the american people can count on social security today  tomorrow and forever  it's the dream of the teacher who works at dunkin donuts after school just to make ends meet  she needs better pay  and more support  and the freedom to do more than just teach to the test  and if her students want to go on to college  they shouldn't fear decades of debt  that's why i'll make college affordable with an annual   tax credit if you're willing to do community service  or national service  we will invest in you  but we'll ask you to invest in your country  that is our calling in this campaign  to reaffirm that fundamental belief   i am my brother's keeper  i am my sister's keeper   that makes us one people  and one nation  it's time to stand up and reach for what's possible  because together  people who love their country can change it  now when i start talking like this  some folks tell me that i've got my head in the clouds  that i need a reality check  that we're still offering false hope  but my own story tells me that in the united states of america  there has never been anything false about hope  i should not be here today  i was not born into money or status  i was born to a teenage mom in hawaii  and my dad left us when i was two  but my family gave me love  they gave me education  and most of all they gave me hope   hope that in america  no dream is beyond our grasp if we reach for it  and fight for it  and work for it  because hope is not blind optimism  i know how hard it will be to make these changes  i know this because i fought on the streets of chicago as a community organizer to bring jobs to the jobless in the shadow of a shuttered steel plant  i've fought in the courts as a civil rights lawyer to make sure people weren't denied their rights because of what they looked like or where they came from  i've fought in the legislature to take power away from lobbyists  i've won some of those fights  but i've lost some of them too  i've seen good legislation die because good intentions weren't backed by a mandate for change  the politics of hope does not mean hoping things come easy  because nothing worthwhile in this country has ever happened unless somebody  somewhere stood up when it was hard  stood up when they were told   no you can't  and said yes we can  and where better to affirm our ideals than here in wisconsin  where a century ago the progressive movement was born  it was rooted in the principle that the voices of the people can speak louder than special interests  that citizens can be connected to their government and to one another  and that all of us share a common destiny  an american dream  yes we can reclaim that dream  yes we can heal this nation  the voices of the american people have carried us a great distance on this improbable journey  but we have much further to go  now we carry our message to farms and factories across this state  and to the cities and small towns of ohio  to the open plains deep in the heart of texas  and all the way to democratic national convention in denver  it's the same message we had when we were up  and when were down  that out of many  we are one  that our destiny will not be written for us  but by us  and that we can cast off our doubts and fears and cynicism because our dream will not be deferred  our future will not be denied  and our time for change has come "], ["obama1", " b matthews b  live from west chester university outside philadelphia  the  hardball college tour  with our special guest  senator barack obama applause and cheers b obama b  all right b matthews b  wow b obama b  how about that b matthews b  wow b obama b  thank you  thank you  thank you b matthews b  one of the perks  senator  of being president of the united states is that you have your own bowling alley laughter b matthews b  are you ready to bowl from day one b obama b  obviously  i am not laughter b matthews b  ha b obama b  but i figure there might be some bowlers here at west chester applause and cheers b obama b  i just want to thank all of them for hosting us  dr  adler and all the students  so this is a wonderful group  thank you so much for having me b matthews b  i know you're a pretty good b ball player b obama b  basketball i can play b matthews b  ok  let me give you some good news  this is good news i'm going to announce it here  an endorsement from you from the philadelphia area  an important endorsement  forget issues like who's ready from day one or who do you want answering a   am phone call in the white house or the ramifications of nafta  to us  the most important issue is very simple and one that no one is talking about in the battle for the democratic nomination for president  who's the biggest jock  and it is based on the answer to that  obviously  earth shattering question that we proudly endorse barack obama for president   philly sport  magazine b obama b  that's what i'm talking about  that's what i'm talking about applause and cheers b obama b  that's what i'm talking about b matthews b  and now we play hardball b obama b  fire away i obama on iraq i b matthews b  that was the warm up  how do we know that you're tough enough to take the heat from the right  from the radio address  from the right wing radio  from the right wing columnists  if you begin to pull our troops out of iraq and they start screaming  who lost iraq how do we know you're as tough as dick cheney to ignore public opinion and do what you believe in  because he's certainly tough enough to do it b obama b  well  first of all  you don't ignore public opinion  you try to shape public opinion  and you try to shape it with the truth  not with false facts  not by shading intelligence reports and you know  in terms of my toughness  look  first of all  i come from chicago  and you know  politics in chicago  as it was once said  is not tiddlywinks  it's not beanbag  you know  it's a tough town but what i've been able to do is to rise politically without compromising my ethics  without compromising my principles  i think during the course of this campaign  we're going up against a pretty tough political operation with the clintons  nobody's ever accused them of being being soft  and so far  we're doing pretty well  and you know  i am very confident that when it comes to issues like iraq  a war that i stood up against at a time when it would have been politically convenient to be for it  or at least to be silent  when it comes to tough issues like talking to leaders we don't like  something that defies some of the conventional wisdom in washington but i feel very strongly about  then i'm going to stick to my guns and try to persuade the american people that we need to go in a new direction and fundamentally break with the failed policies of the past seven and a half years b matthews b  when the democratic voters of pennsylvania and they're the only ones that can vote and all these people told me they're all registered  right b obama b  absolutely applause and cheers b matthews b  and how many of you are for this gentleman applause and cheers b matthews b  and how many of you are for hillary applause and cheers b matthews b  ok  fair enough  what's the difference between you  i mean  this their parents are watching  they're watching  their friends are watching right now  and they want to go in that voting booth aware  what is the real difference in how you would get us out of iraq from the way senator clinton would get us out b obama b  well  first of all  i think it does bear mentioning that senator clinton voted for the war  and i say that not because it is something that's in the past  but it points to judgment in the future  i think senator clinton was much more cautious  she got swept up in the arguments that were made by the bush administration  and i think that what you want in the next president who has confidence and judgment to move in a different direction she has said she wants to pull troops out  and i take her at her word  i intend to pull them out  as well  and i think that we both agree that you have to be as cautious getting out as we were careless getting in  she has  though  suggested that she wants to leave troops in to blunt the influence of iran in iraq  that that would be one of the rationales or justifications for how she would structure forces inside of iraq i think that's a mistake  i think that that's mission creep  that is not the original reason why we went in  originally  it was because of weapons of mass destruction  we know those aren't there  it was because saddam hussein was a terrible tyrant  he is now gone  we should not be maintaining permanent bases in iraq  we should have no combat operations if you look at the recent fighting in basra  it's between shia militias  and in fact  we know that iran had some influence in settling the dispute  partly because the government that we helped to install is very close to the iranian government  so what i want to see is getting our combat troops out  no permanent bases  we should protect our embassy  we should protect humanitarian forces in the region  we should up our commitment to humanitarian aid inside of iraq because we've got two million displaced persons inside of iraq right now and we have to initiate the kinds of political settlement that includes all the factions inside iraq but also those surrounding iraq  the regional powers saudi arabia  jordan  but also iran and syria  who are going to have some say about what happens in iraq  no matter what we do  and it's important for to us bring them to the table in a broader international effort so that we've got a stable country and we can start focusing on what we should have focused on in the first place  the war in afghanistan and going after al qaeda and bin laden and those who killed   americans applause b matthews b  the way you tell it  it sounds like hillary clinton and john mccain have a similar policy of maintaining the american presence  military presence in iraq indefinitely  it sounds like they're the same  do you believe that b obama b  no  i don't think there's a huge difference between any of the democrats and john mccain  i mean  john mccain got upset  i think  today  apparently  because i had repeated exactly what he said  which is that we might be there for a hundred years  if he had his way  now  he's now arguing  well  i didn't mean that we would be fighting a war for a hundred years  we might just be present  what he is talking about is having a permanent occupation and permanent bases inside of iraq we are spending right now   billion to   billion a month inside of iraq  that's that's money that could be spent giving college scholarships to all these young people applause and cheers b obama b  it's money that could be spent getting jobs here in america  rebuilding our infrastructure  as i've proposed  but more importantly  it is it would mean a sustained presence at a time when we should be focused on finishing the war that needs to be won against al qaeda in their home bases in afghanistan and in the hills of pakistan  where we know that they are planning to attack u s  targets b matthews b  what's the impact economically  this state has lost   guys and women killed in that war  of course  the personal losses are unimaginable and hard to measure  but economically  we've lost in this state   manufacturing jobs under president bush  a lot of people believe you can't reproduce those jobs  we're going to have to go to high tech or something  can you honestly do what mitt romney did in michigan and say we're going to get those jobs back when i was growing up here  a guy could come out of high school  and he could go get a job at bud or vertal  a big industrial plant  build big things b obama b  right b matthews b    big jobs building trains  building subway cars and airplanes and provide for a whole family  get the kids through college  one guy working  one family member working b obama b  right b matthews b  will we ever get back to those days b obama b  well  i'm not sure that the same jobs are going to be back but i think we can produce good jobs that pay good wages and good benefits  i mean  here's how we do it  first of all  we've got to stabilize the housing market because right now  even businesses with good track records  good credit are having trouble getting financing to expand and invest because the financial markets are all screwed up  the only way we deal with that is to make sure that people aren't having their homes foreclosed on and you know  so i'm working with chris dodd to put together a program where the federal housing administration helps borrowers and lenders negotiate to settle on a fixed mortgage that home owners can pay and allows them to stay in their homes so we're not continuing to see home values drop  that's step number one we also have to have better oversight in the financial markets  that's been a disaster  something this administration has not done b matthews b  how about the previous administration  how good was president clinton in regulating the hedge funds  did he give them a free rein b obama b  well  i here's what i think  i think there's been a general tendency for the banks and the financial institutions to set the agenda in washington and to crosstalk b matthews b  the democrats  too b obama b    democrats and republicans  and what's happened is that they have constantly pushed for deregulation  some of that deregulation is useful  some of it allows for the kinds of predatory loans that have been getting us into trouble  so we've got to get the housing mark set then what we have to do is start ending the war in iraq  reinvesting in infrastructure roads  bridges  locks  dams  that puts people to work b matthews b  like i  out here b obama b  absolutely b matthews b  they got a little problem  you know  out here b obama b  and that puts people back to work b matthews b  yes obama  especially folks from the construction industry that have been laid off because of the housing slump  and then what we have to do is get our tax code right  stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  invest in companies that are investing right here in the united states of america and the last point the possibility of new jobs in new sectors like energy  i went to a steel mill that had closed and now has been converted  and it's making something big  those big windmills that are producing green energy for america  those jobs are not being shipped overseas  and you've got unionized steel workers in those plants  making jobs  that's got to be the direction that we move on in the future b matthews b  that's out in bucks county  right b obama b  absolutely applause and cheers b matthews b  let me ask you when we come back  i'm going to ask youthat's the day job for the president  i want to ask you what you're going to be like at   o'clock in the morning when we get right back more with hardball and senator barack obama when we come back on the  college tour  west chester university in pennsylvania applause and cheers b unidentified female b  you're watching the  hardball college tour  here at west chester university  only on msnbc b unidentified male b  you're watching the  hardball college tour  here at west chester university  only on msnbc b unidentified female b  you're watching the  hardball college tour  here at west chester university  only on msnbc applause and cheers i obama answers students' questions i   b matthews b  welcome back to west chester university outside philadelphia  the first question of the night  go ahead b unidentified female b  my name is brittany ransome  and i'm a student here  and in the past recent years  there have been some cuts in federal funding and student aid  i would like to know personally what you plan on doing in increasing that aid for college students b obama b  well  thanks for the question  brittany  and this is something i hear about all across the country  and first of all  i've got a personal stake in this because when michelle and i graduated from law school  our combined monthly student loan was more than our mortgage  and that was true for about   years  and we were luckier than most because  as attorneys  we could make a little more than if somebody was a teacher or somebody was a social worker we've got to deal with this  i want to restore money that's already been taken away  number one  number two  i want to expand pell grants because we need more grants  fewer loans so that students aren't piling up huge amounts of debt applause and cheers b obama b  number three number three  i want to create a   tuition credit  every student  every year  but young people will not be able to get it for free  you guys are going to have to participate in community service  work in a homeless shelter  work in a veterans' home  join the peace corps applause and cheers b obama b  so we'll invest in you we'll invest in you  you invest in america  and together  the country will get stronger  and you guys won't be loaded up with so much debt when you leave college  and one of the ways to pay for it  by the way  is eliminating the middlemen in some of the federal direct loan programs  you've got banks and loan institutions that are making billions of dollars off student loans  that's something that we've got to change applause and cheers b unidentified male b  hi  my name is shane daniels  i'm interested in how has this campaign and the situation with your pastor affected your spiritual life  and how will that influence your presidency b obama b  that's an interesting question  the you know  i am i am a christian  and i pray every night  and when you're running for president  you pray even more laughter b obama b  although it's interesting  what i pray for  the longer i'm in this  is less about me and more about  first of all  making sure my family's ok  but the second thing is that whatever i'm doing is actually good for the people i want to serve and good for the country the longer i'm in this process  the more you realize that you're going to be successful if you can get your ego out of it and focus on the job that needs to be done and what people are going through that i talk to every day  you know  obviously  there's a flap in terms of my former pastor  and that was a difficult moment  you know  this is somebody who  on the one hand  is a good man  but said some things that i deeply disagree with and you know  i tried to give a speech here in philadelphia to indicate the broader context of the anger that still exists and the resentments that still exists between the races  and you know  my belief is that  you know  one of the important things about my christian faith is that you forgive people  you try to understand them  and you know  ultimately  you know  the judge is going to be god is going to be somebody who's making judgments about many of these things applause and cheers b obama b  so i'm going to stay focused on the job that i'm doing  and hopefully  you'll pray for me  too applause and cheers b unidentified female b  hello  chris  hi  senator obama b obama b  about many of these things  so  i'm just going to applause   b obama b    stay focused on the job that i'm doing  and and  hopefully  you will pray for me  too   laughter cheering and applause   crosstalk b unidentified female b  hello  chris  hi  senator obama  i'm interested i understand that you want to increase the teachers' salaries  which i'm all for  since i will be a teacher   cheering and applause   b unidentified female b  but i want to know your stance on merit pay and how it will affect special education teachers and then those in low ses areas   b obama b  well  the i'm not in fair of merit pay as it is currently understood  which basically b matthews b  neither is that lady over there   laughter b obama b    which basically involves taking test scores and then rewarding people on how they score on tests  how students score on tests  because the problem is  let's say  special ed students  or esl students  by definition  special ed students are behind  and may need special help  they may not move at the same pace  even though we can aspire to make sure that they get the best education possible  students for whom english is a second language  they may be behind in terms of test scores  even though they're very intelligent  just because it is not their native language that they're speaking  this is a broader problem that has to do with no child left behind i want the highest standards for our students  but i don't want standards measured solely by a single high stakes standardized test  i want to have cheering and applause   b obama b  i want to make sure that our standards are crafted with educators  with teachers  i do believe in creating career ladders for teachers  so that  if they become a master teacher  if they become nationally board certified  if they have done other things to improve their own professional development  that they can potentially get more pay  i think that's important   cheering and applause   b matthews b  ok   cheering and applause   b matthews b  we only have a couple seconds  your question   b unidentified female b  yes  hi  my name is  inaudible  and as a type   diabetic  i was just wondering what you are going to do to gain further support for stem cell research and obama  well  the thing is  actually  we have enough support in the senate and the house to pass this bill  george bush has vetoed it  here's what we will do  we just need one more vote  and that's the vote of the president  and since i will be the president  we will sign stem cell research cheering and applause   b matthews b  we are going to come right back with some  in the morning questions for senator barack obama  more of the hardball college tour from west chester university  when we come back cheering and applause   commercial break cheering and applause   i obama on   a m  phone calls if elected i b matthews b  let me give you a scene that may face you in the next year or two  where the national security adviser calls you at   in the morning and tells that you a couple of jet commercial jets have been hijacked  and they believe it is al qaeda  and  as we know  al qaeda always tries a second time  they tried for the world trade center after   they came back in   they're heading for the capitol  what do you do   b obama b  well  look  i am hesitant to engage in hypotheticals like that  because b matthews b  but it has been predictable b obama b  oh  well  the i don't think anybody predicted   and  so  we don't know what kinds of circumstances are going to come up  here's the important thing about that   a m  phone call  what you want is somebody who is  first of all  going to get all the facts and gather up good intelligence  the second thing you want is somebody who is able to analyze the situation  the costs and benefits of action  and one of the things that we know this president didn't do is to weigh the costs of going into iraq vs  the potential benefits of it  we want somebody who is going to be decisive  and i won't hesitate to strike against somebody who would do us harm  if that's what is required  but the most important thing that you need is somebody who is going to exercise good judgment  and judgment is not simply a matter of sounding tough or talking tough  it is a matter of weighing and making good decisions under stress  and  if you think about  for example  john f  kennedy  his biggest mistake was going ahead with military action that hadn't been thought through   b matthews b  right   b obama b  his greatest triumph was actually showing restraint in a very dangerous  difficult situation  now  obviously  something involving al qaeda is not comparable  and my whole plan for going after terrorists is to refocus attention on terrorist networks  something that the iraq war has been a distraction from  and what i have said repeatedly is  for example  i won't hesitate to strike against al qaeda bases and high value targets  if pakistan is not willing to act  and we have our sights on somebody  we should go after them  i was sharply criticized for that  both by john mccain  hillary clinton  and george bush  except it turned out that  three weeks ago  we had one of our most successful strikes against one of the highest ranking al qaeda leaders doing precisely that  and i think that indicates the degree to which i am more than willing to use our military power where necessary  but we have to use it in a way that is responsible  and weighs all the ramifications of action  and is based on the best available evidence  and not based on politics and ideology   b matthews b  most people believe that the applause b matthews b    intelligence was corrupted in this administration  that it was manipulated manipulated by civilians b obama b  right   b matthews b    with political and ideological intent  how do you clean out the intelligence agencies and let them know you want the real intelligence  you don't want twisted case made for whatever policy somebody is selling at the bureaucratic level b obama b  well  it starts at the top  it starts at the top  if the president is basing his actions on ideas that are preconceived and wants to ignore facts  and only wants to hear things that reinforce what he already believes  or she already believes  then you are going to have a problem  and that's why i think it is so important that we send a clear directive to everybody in our intelligence communities that i want independent thinking  and i want people who disagree with me  as well as people who agree with me  i want to have everybody around the table  this is one of the most important criteria  i think  for having a good cabinet  a good sub cabinet  and an effective federal government  is  when people have confidence that  if if they bring uncomfortable facts to the table  that somebody is going to listen to them  and they are not going to be punished for bringing bad news  that is how you actually end up making good decisions   b matthews b  can you do this from day one  can you make sure that the intelligence agencies get that message fast   b obama b  absolutely  i mean  i think one of the first things that you have to do  even during transition  is to make sure that you send a message to everybody  i want all the bad news  and i want the bad news sooner than i want the good news   b matthews b  ok  thank you very much  we will be right back with barack obama with some personal questions   cheering and applause   commercial break cheering and applause   i obama gets personal i b matthews b  we're back  i want to this is a great audience  senator barama i senator barack obama   laughter b matthews b  this is a strange question  but everything is ethnic this year  so i will ask it  what it's like to be a black kid with a white mom   b obama b  well  i tell you what  it is part of what america is about you know  we're a melting pot  and the cheering and applause   b obama b  what it what i think it did for me was to give me a perspective that maybe is broader on some of the misunderstandings that people go through  but also an appreciation of everybody's cultures  it is not just the fact that i have a black dad and a white mom  it's  i have got a sister who is half indonesian  who is married to a chinese canadian   laughter b obama b  i have got a niece who looks like  you know  she's all mixed up   laughter b obama b  and  you know  so when you get our family together i have said this before  i wrote a book  i have got family members that look like margaret thatcher  i have got family members that look like bernie mac   laughter b obama b  you know  and  so what it does what it means is  i i'm not going to engage in stereotypes about people  because you never know where people are coming from  and i really have learned to believe that everybody has common values and common ideals  and  especially here in america  everybody wants the same thing  they want a good job  they want to take care of their families  they want health care they can afford  they want to be able to send their kids to college  retire with dignity and respect   b matthews b  when you and everybody wants to know this stuff cheering and applause   b matthews b  see  the people here  the young people here  who are black don't know what it is like to be white  and the white people don't know what it is like to be black  and you have a better look at that than anybody b obama b  well  i think that  as i said before  people have a lot more in common than i think we give them credit for  the part of the problem is  our politics fans division  it feeds on it  it is not that it is not there already  but  a lot of times  it is a convenient way to stir things up  and one of the things that we have tried to do in this campaign and i think young people are tapped into this is to say  look  people of different races occupy different situations and have a different history  and we have got to address some of that different history   b matthews b  yes   b obama b  but people's aspirations  their capacity for good and for bad  it really is the same  and we're at our best when we join together  we're at our best when we're unified  we're at our worst when we're divided and when our politics is based along tribal and ethnic lines applause b obama b    instead of based on who we are as americans   applause b matthews b  you know applause   b matthews b  you know that term in politics called the dog whistle  where you say something and certain people hear it  and they can't get caught using it  but they know what they're doing do you think the clinton campaign is using a dog whistle by constantly talking about your former pastor   b obama b  no  i look  i think that i think that b matthews b  are they playing that ethnic card   b obama b  no  look  i think that's fair game  in the sense that what my former pastor said was offensive  and i think that  in politics  whether i was white  black  hispanic  asian  somebody would be trying to use it against me  and  you know  i do think that it is important to keep things in perspective  and to remind ourselves that  over the last two weeks  we have marked the fifth anniversary of a war that has now lasted longer than world war i  world war ii  and the civil war   b matthews b  yes   b obama b  i think it is important for us to remind ourselves   americans have died  more than   americans  that families are now suffering three  four tours of duty  putting enormous strain on military families  the people that are losing their homes  so  you know  my the one thing i think about our politics that weneed to fix  aside from pushing the special interests that have come todominate washington out  and let the american people back in  is alsonot to be distracted and to the one thing i think about our politics that we need to fix  aside from pushing the special interests that have come to dominate washington out  and let the american people back in  is also not to be distracted  and to make sure we're focusing on the big things that are going to make a difference in these young people's lives   years from now    years from now    years from now  instead of what was the latest gaff or what did this surrogate say or that surrogate say  which really three weeks from now  everybody will have forgotten  but we won't have forgotten the fact that global warming is still a big issue and a war is still going on and our economy is starting to slip   b matthews b  that said  when you hear divisive language  whether from your preacher or from anyone else  why didn't you walk out of that church  when you heard that  what you called controversial language  why didn't you go back and give him   dollars in contributions to your church  why did you just say  he's on a different side of this fight than i am   b obama b  i think that what has happened is we took a loop out of  and compressed the most offensive things that a pastor said over the course of thirty years  and just ran it over and over and over again  there is that other   years  i never heard him say those things that were in those clips   b matthews b  but you did say you heard him say controversial things   b obama b  but i've heard you say controversial things   b matthews b  you didn't give me   dollars either   b obama b  the point is this is a church that is active in aids  it's active on all kind of thing  and so this is a wonderful church  but as i said  look at the amount of time that's been spent on this today  chris  at a time when we haven't talked about a whole host of issues   b matthews b  you know the republicans will bring it back   b obama b  of course it will come back  of course the republicans will bring it back  the question is  what is actually going to make a difference in the lives of people who right now are on the verge of losing their home  what is going to make a difference in their lives   b matthews b  when did you have your last cigarette   b obama b  you know b matthews b  was that the last time you cried  what was that like  because that shows bush the president gave up booze  i always thought that was an impressive thing about him  i gave it up  i know how hard it is  you just give it up cold turkey  what was it like to you and what advice can you give these kids   b obama b  don't start   b matthews b  don't start  what does it take  besides a lot of people watching you  in your case b obama b  having your wife say on   minutes  that if you see barack with a cigarette  let me know  that b matthews b  no cheating   b obama b  well  you know b matthews b  no cheating   b obama b  i fell off the wagon a couple times during the course of it  and then was able to get back on  but it is a struggle like everything else  and i think that it is important to just keep in mind  i have a nine year old daughter and a six year old daughter  and i want to give them away in their weddings and i want to see my grand kids  and i want to set a good example for all these young people here  and i want to make sure as president of the united states  everybody knows that i'm going to try to stay healthy  i need you guys to stay healthy  too  because we need to bring our health care costs down   b matthews b  how many smokers are there here right now  smokers stand up  smokers stand up  come on  be honest  come on  smokers   b obama b  all right  guys   b matthews b  talk to these people   b obama b  you need to get it straight  you guys need get on the case b matthews b  i applaud this school  a very low smoking school  or else a very dishonest school  let me ask you  any time in this campaign  did you have a chuckle that you just couldn't get rid of  something weird that happened  it was so crazy that you just went to bed laughing about it   b obama b  i think that happens once a day  but then i stopped watching cable news   b matthews b  oh  i got another set of cards in the back room  no  let me ask you about the campaign  do you think that you've learned i know you've done a lot of this  this is amazing to meet so many young people of different backgrounds  to see these smiling faces  it must be the most wonderful experience for you  but what can you say  if you had to write another book after this campaign and said  what did i profoundly learn about this country of mine that i really  really didn't know before this thing started  can you come up with it  did you learn anything or has it between fast   b obama b  well  it has been more confirmation of what i had hoped  when i got into the race  i hoped that people were ready for a different kind of politics  i hoped that young people who had been sitting on the sidelines decided  now is the time for us to get involved  i'll be honest with you  i didn't expect such an enormous wave  we've seen record turnouts  record participation  you had in iowa young people participated in the same rates as people over   that's unheard of in the annals of american politics  so that's been extremely encouraging  how interested people are in what their government is doing right now  and i think that when that happens  good thing happen  our problems always occur when nobody is paying attention and the fat cats and the lobbyists end up setting the agenda in washington  and when the american people are paying attention  they hold the government accountable and it makes an enormous difference  we actually start solving problems  that's what i think we can do starting next year   b matthews b  thank you  we'll be right back with more of senator barack obama from west chester university in philadelphia   commercial break i obama on gay marriage  education i   b matthews b  we're back with the students at west chester university let me get it straight here  you guys are unforgiving here  a small technical error  let's go to the first question   b unidentified male b  hi  senator obama  my name is david bernett and i just have a question for you  and that is where do you stand on gay marriage   b obama b  i'm not in favor of gay marriage  but i'm in favor of a very strong civil union  right now  states even where you've got civil unions still aren't getting the same benefits at the federal level  so the federal government just doesn't recognize them  and that is about   laws  rights and benefits that are not being given to same sex couples  it is it is very important that those laws apply equally  i think it is very important that we pass a human rights ordinance  like i passed along with another close sponsor in illinois  to prevent discrimination in housing  in jobs  i think young people are way ahead of the curve this issue  and i think it is important for the rest of the country to catch up and make sure that everybody is treated the same regardless of sexual orientation   b matthews b  isn't it discrimination when you say people can't get married   b obama b  i think that it is important for us to make sure that all the legal rights that are conferred in a marriage are also conferred in a civil union   inaudible b obama b  there you go  and i think it is very important that the state makes sure that they are not denying the same kind of rights that have historically been denied  because when i think about a same sex couple not being able to visit each other in the hospital  when i think about them not being able to transfer property  or to pass on benefits  i that's contrary to what most americans believe  and that's why i'm going to change it when i'm president of the united states   b matthews b  next question   b unidentified female b  my name is tiara smalls  my question is how can you improve inner city public school systems  making education a priority  and improving the quality of education so that urban students can be competitive   b obama b  it's a great question  part of what we have to do is start with the earliest years  we've got to expand drastically early childhood education  we've got that's not just pre k  it's also starting with at risk parents when they have their child  working with them to make sure that they are reading to their kids  and if they can't read to them  then teaching those parents to read  making sure they have books  making sure those children are getting regular check ups  which means we've got to have a health care system that everybody can access  making certain that kids are being screened for hearing deficits or visual impairments  making sure they're getting decent nutrition  and if we are taking care of kids early  then they start school already prepared  if we don't  they're already behind  and they stay behind  every investment  every dollar we invest in early childhood education  we get at leaf   dollars back in improved reading scores  reduced drop out rates  then we have to improve k  education  that primarily has to do with teachers  paying teachers more and giving them more professional development and support  the third thing is after school programs and summer school programs that can keep kids off the streets  give them constructive things to do after school  and the final thing is giving young people a sense of a future  so if you've got a ninth grader  a  th grader  maybe they're not going to go to a four year college  but if they're good artists  they might want to be a graphic designer  matching them up with the possibilities of a career and a job there  or if they're good manually  then getting them on apprenticeship programs while they're still in high school  so that they can start seeing the possibilities of a career in the trades  those are the kinds of ways that you can tie what happens in school with kids' vision for their future  and if they have a sense that they have a future that allows them to raise a family and live a productive life  i think most young people will see that  the problem is they're just not seeing that right now  right now all they see is drugs and jail  and if that's the only thing in front of you  then you're probably going to fail   b matthews b  thank you  this primary in philadelphia and pennsylvania will be held in three weeks  it is an important part of the process  i want to ask you if this process ends up  after puerto rico  at the end of the schedule  where you have the most elected delegates  should you be the nominee   b obama b  well  if i have the most pledged delegates  meaning after all the votes have been cast in caucuses and primaries  if i also think we will have had the most popular vote and we will have won the most states  then i think most of the super delegates who have not yet decided  i think  will recognize that we've earned this nomination  that's not guaranteed and i don't take it for grand  but i think at that point  i will have shown myself to be the strongest candidate to run against john mccain   b matthews b  is that the only legitimate result of this campaign  the one who gets the most elected delegates is the nominee  could you imagine senator clinton being nominated in denver in the last week of august  not having won the battle for elected delegates and you would support her   b obama b  i'm not going to worry about that right now because what i want to do is to make sure that i've won as many contests as possible  won as many delegates as possible  and then i'll let the poobahs of the party make a decision in terms of how they want to deal with it   b matthews b  do you trust the poobahs   b obama b  what i know is that we've excited the electorate  we've brought people out  we have won every state every kind of state all across the country  and i think  in that circumstance  i will be the strongest nominee to go up against john mccain and serve as a sharp break and contrast from the failed policies of the last seven years   b matthews b  watch the whole show again  we'll be back at   and   tonight  especially at   the whole show  you'll get the whole college tour from west chester university  senator barack obama  thank you "], ["obama1", "everywhere i go in indiana  and across this country  i'm talking to folks who are working harder and harder just to get by  at a time when our economy is in turmoil and wages are stagnant  hardworking families are struggling to pay rising costs  and few costs are rising more than the one folks pay at the pump  for the well off in this country  high gas prices are mostly an annoyance  but to most americans  they're a huge problem  bordering on a crisis  here in indiana  gas costs about   a gallon   and across the country  gas costs more than at any time in almost thirty years  over the last year alone  the price of oil has shot up more than   reaching a record high of more than   a barrel   all of which helps explain why the top oil companies made   billion last year  now  there's nothing wrong with a company being rewarded for its success  our economy has always been powered by innovation and ingenuity  but the reason americans keep going to the pump isn't because oil companies are being particularly innovative  it's because washington politicians didn't deal with the challenge of alternative energy when they had the chance  when george bush asked dick cheney to come up with our energy policy a few years ago  he met with the environmental groups once  and he met with the renewable energy folks once  and he met with the oil and gas companies   times  and yet  we also know this problem goes deeper than the bush administration  because we've been talking about high gas prices in this country since americans were sitting in gas lines in the  s  and we've heard promises about energy independence from every president   democratic and republican   since richard nixon  and yet the only thing that's different now is that we are even more dependent on foreign oil  our planet is in even greater peril  and the price of gas keeps going up and up and up  so unless we're willing to challenge the broken system in washington  and stop letting lobbyists use their clout to get their way  nothing else is going to change  and the reason i'm running for president is to challenge that system  i'm the only candidate in this race who's worked to rein in the power of lobbyists by passing historic ethics reforms in illinois and in the senate  and i'm the only one who isn't taking a dime from washington lobbyists  we need a president who's looking out for families in indiana  not just doing what's good for multinational corporations  and that's the kind of president i'll be  it isn't right that oil companies are making record profits at a time when ordinary americans are going into debt trying to pay rising energy costs  in the paper today  there was an article about how millions of americans are falling behind on their energy bills  and a record number of americans could face energy shut offs over the next two months  that's why we'll put a windfall profits tax on oil companies and use it to help indiana families pay their heating and cooling bills and reduce energy costs  we'll also take steps to reduce the price of oil and increase transparency in how prices are set so we can ensure that energy companies aren't bending the rules  and to help indiana families meet the rising cost of gas  we'll put a middle class tax cut in their pockets that will save them   a year  and we'll eliminate income taxes altogether for seniors making less than   so these are a few short term steps we can take to ease the burden that indiana families are bearing as a result of our failed energy policy  but the truth is  there is no easy answer to our energy crisis   and we need a president who's going to be straight with us about that  a president who's going to tell the american people not just what they want to hear  but what they need to know  and what they need to know is that any real solution isn't going to come about overnight  it's going to take time  to bring about real change  we're going to have to make long term investments in clean energy and energy efficiency  that's why i reached across the aisle in the senate to come up with a plan to double our fuel efficiency standards that won support of lawmakers who had never supported raising those standards before  and that's why i voted for an energy bill that was far from perfect because it was the largest investment in renewable energy in history  and i fought to eliminate the tax giveaways to oil companies that were slipped into that bill  and as president  i'll work to solve this energy crisis once and for all  we'll invest   billion over the next ten years in establishing a green energy sector that will create up to   million new jobs   and those are jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  we'll invest in clean energies like solar  wind  and biodiesel  and we'll help make sure that the fuel we're using is more efficient  the candidates with the washington experience   my opponents   are good people  they mean well  but they've been in washington for a long time  and even with all that experience they talk about  nothing has happened  this country didn't raise fuel efficiency standards for over thirty years  so what have we got for all that experience  gas that's approaching   a gallon   because you can fight all you want inside washington  but until you change the way it works  you won't be able to make the changes americans need  in the end  we'll only ease the burden of gas prices on our families when hoosiers and people all across america say  enough  it's time to free ourselves from the tyranny of oil  and stop funding both sides in the war on terror  it's time to save this planet for our children  the time is now   not after the next election or the one after that  you shouldn't accept any more excuses for why it can't be done  it won't happen tomorrow  but if we can come together in this election  we can and will begin  and the first step is changing the way business is done in washington  if we can do that  then the energy crisis is one i'm confident we can solve "], ["obama1", "you know  there is a spirit that brought us here tonight   a spirit of change  and hope  and possibility  and there are few people in this country who embody that spirit more than our friend and our champion  senator edward kennedy  he has spent his life in service to this country not for the sake of glory or recognition  but because he cares   deeply  in his gut   about the causes of justice  and equality  and opportunity  so many of us here have benefited in some way or another because of the battles he's waged  and some of us are here because of them  we know he is not well right now  but we also know that he's a fighter  and as he takes on this fight  let us lift his spirits tonight by letting ted kennedy know that we are thinking of him  that we are praying for him  that we are standing with him  and that we will be fighting with him every step of the way  fifteen months ago  in the depths of winter  it was in this great state where we took the first steps of an unlikely journey to change america  the skeptics predicted we wouldn't get very far  the cynics dismissed us as a lot of hype and a little too much hope  and by the fall  the pundits in washington had all but counted us out  but the people of iowa had a different idea  from the very beginning  you knew that this journey wasn't about me or any of the other candidates in this race  it's about whether this country   at this defining moment   will continue down the same road that has failed us for so long  or whether we will seize this opportunity to take a different path   to forge a different future for the country we love  that is the question that sent thousands upon thousands of you to high school gyms and vfw halls  to backyards and front porches  to steak fries and jj dinners  where you spoke about what that future would look like  you spoke of an america where working families don't have to file for bankruptcy just because a child gets sick  where they don't lose their home because some predatory lender tricks them out of it  where they don't have to sit on the sidelines of the global economy because they couldn't afford the cost of a college education  you spoke of an america where our parents and grandparents don't spend their retirement in poverty because some ceo dumped their pension   an america where we don't just value wealth  but the work and the workers who create it  you spoke of an america where we don't send our sons and daughters on tour after tour of duty to a war that has cost us thousands of lives and billions of dollars but has not made us safer  you spoke of an america where we match the might of our military with the strength of our diplomacy and the power of our ideals   a nation that is still the beacon of all that is good and all that is possible for humankind  you spoke of a future where the politics we have in washington finally reflect the values we hold as americans   the values you live by here in iowa  common sense and honesty  generosity and compassion  decency and responsibility  these values don't belong to one class or one region or even one party   they are the values that bind us together as one country  that is the country i saw in the faces of crowds that would stretch far into the horizon of our heartland   faces of every color  of every age   faces i see here tonight  you are democrats who are tired of being divided  republicans who no longer recognize the party that runs washington  independents who are hungry for change  you are the young people who've been inspired for the very first time and those not so young folks who've been inspired for the first time in a long time  you are veterans and church goers  sportsmen and students  farmers and factory workers  teachers and business owners who have varied backgrounds and different traditions  but the same simple dreams for your children's future  many of you have been disappointed by politics and politicians more times than you can count  you've seen promises broken and good ideas drown in the sea of influence  and point scoring  and petty bickering that has consumed washington  and you've been told over and over and over again to be cynical  and doubtful  and even fearful about the possibility that things can ever be different  and yet  in spite of all the doubt and disappointment   or perhaps because of it   you came out on a cold winter's night in numbers that this country has never seen  and you stood for change  and because you did  a few more stood up  and then a few thousand stood up  and then a few million stood up  and tonight  in the fullness of spring  with the help of those who stood up from portland to louisville  we have returned to iowa with a majority of delegates elected by the american people  and you have put us within reach of the democratic nomination for president of the united states  the road here has been long  and that is partly because we've traveled it with one of the most formidable candidates to ever run for this office  in her thirty five years of public service  senator hillary rodham clinton has never given up on her fight for the american people  and tonight i congratulate her on her victory in kentucky  we have had our disagreements during this campaign  but we all admire her courage  her commitment and her perseverance  no matter how this primary ends  senator clinton has shattered myths and broken barriers and changed the america in which my daughters and yours will come of age  some may see the millions upon millions of votes cast for each of us as evidence that our party is divided  but i see it as proof that we have never been more energized and united in our desire to take this country in a new direction  more than anything  we need this unity and this energy in the months to come  because while our primary has been long and hard fought  the hardest and most important part of our journey still lies ahead  we face an opponent  john mccain  who arrived in washington nearly three decades ago as a vietnam war hero  and earned an admirable reputation for straight talk and occasional independence from his party  but this year's republican primary was a contest to see which candidate could out bush the other  and that is the contest john mccain won  the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest   of americans that once bothered senator mccain's conscience are now his only economic policy  the bush health care plan that only helps those who are already healthy and wealthy is now john mccain's answer to the   million americans without insurance and the millions more who can't pay their medical bills  the bush iraq policy that asks everything of our troops and nothing of iraqi politicians is john mccain's policy too  and so is the fear of tough and aggressive diplomacy that has left this country more isolated and less secure than at any time in recent history  the lobbyists who ruled george bush's washington are now running john mccain's campaign  and they actually had the nerve to say that the american people won't care about this  talk about out of touch  i will leave it up to senator mccain to explain to the american people whether his policies and positions represent long held convictions or washington calculations  but the one thing they don't represent is change  change is a tax code that rewards work instead of wealth by cutting taxes for middle class families  and senior citizens  and struggling homeowners  a tax code that rewards businesses that create good jobs here in america instead of the corporations that ship them overseas  that's what change is  change is a health care plan that guarantees insurance to every american who wants  that brings down premiums for every family who needs it  that stops insurance companies from discriminating and denying coverage to those who need it most  change is an energy policy that doesn't rely on buddying up to the saudi royal family and then begging them for oil   an energy policy that puts a price on pollution and makes the oil companies invest their record profits in clean  renewable sources of energy that will create five million new jobs and leave our children a safer planet  that's what change is  change is giving every child a world class education by recruiting an army of new teachers with better pay and more support  by promising four years of tuition to any american willing to serve their community and their country  by realizing that the best education starts with parents who turn off the tv  and take away the video games  and read to our children once in awhile  change is ending a war that we never should've started and finishing a war against al qaeda in afghanistan that we never should've ignored  change is facing the threats of the twenty first century not with bluster  or fear mongering  or tough talk  but with tough diplomacy  and strong alliances  and confidence in the ideals that have made this nation the last  best hope of earth  that is the legacy of roosevelt  and truman  and kennedy  that is what change is  that is the choice in this election  the same question that first led us to iowa fifteen months ago is the one that has brought us back here tonight  it is the one we will debate from washington to florida  from new hampshire to new mexico   the question of whether this country  at this moment  will keep doing what we've been doing for four more years  or whether we will take that different path  it is more of the same versus change  it is the past versus the future  it has been asked and answered by generations before us  and now it is our turn to choose  we will face our share of difficult and uncertain days in the journey ahead  the other side knows they have embraced yesterday's policies and so they will also embrace yesterday's tactics to try and change the subject  they will play on our fears and our doubts and our divisions to distract us from what matters to you and your future  well they can take the low road if they want  but it will not lead this country to a better place  and it will not work in this election  it won't work because you won't let it  not this time  not this year  my faith in the decency  and honesty  and generosity of the american people is not based on false hope or blind optimism  but on what i have lived and what i have seen in this very state  for in the darkest days of this campaign  when we were dismissed by all the polls and all the pundits  i would come to iowa and see that there was something happening here that the world did not yet understand  it's what led high school and college students to give up their vacations to stuff envelopes and knock on doors  and why grandparents have spent all their afternoons making phone calls to perfect strangers  it's what led men and women who can barely pay the bills to dig into their savings and write five dollar checks and ten dollar checks  and why young people from all over this country have left their friends and their families for a job that offers little pay and less sleep  change is coming to america  it's the spirit that sent the first patriots to lexington and concord and led the defenders of freedom to light the way north on an underground railroad  it's what sent my grandfather's generation to beachheads in normandy  and women to seneca falls  and workers to picket lines and factory fences  it's what led all those young men and women who saw beatings and billy clubs on their television screens to leave their homes  and get on buses  and march through the streets of selma and montgomery   black and white  rich and poor  change is coming to america  it's what i saw all those years ago on the streets of chicago when i worked as an organizer   that in the face of joblessness  and hopelessness  and despair  a better day is still possible if there are people willing to work for it  and fight for it  and believe in it  that's what i've seen here in iowa  that's what is happening in america   our journey may be long  our work will be great  but we know in our hearts we are ready for change  we are ready to come together  and in this election  we are ready to believe again  thank you iowa  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "i just had the pleasure of sitting down with ryan and jenny micke  and hearing about some of the challenges that they're facing in these tough economic times  we're going to continue our dialogue in a few moments  but i want to start by talking a little bit about my plan to provide meaningful tax relief for working people  americans work longer and harder than the people of any other wealthy nation  we've built the largest economy that the world has ever known  and the biggest middle class in history  but for the last eight years  we've failed to keep the fundamental promise that if you work hard you can live your own version of the american dream  instead  folks are working harder for less  the cost of everything from gas  to groceries to tuition is skyrocketing  it's harder to save  and harder to retire  at kitchen tables like ryan and jenny's  it's easy to feel like that dream of opportunity that should be the right of all americans is slipping away  this troubling story is written into communities across the country  it's the story of empty factories shut down forever because the jobs were shipped overseas and nothing took their place  it's the story of a mother who can't afford health care for her sick child  a father who lost his job and can't afford a tank of gas to look for another  a child facing a future where they'll have to pay off hundreds of billions of dollars in debt to pay for george bush's tax cuts  and i am running for president of the united states of america because the story of this downturn starts in washington  and washington has to change  these difficult times are not an accident of history   they are a consequence of a tired and misguided economic philosophy in washington  it's a philosophy that values wealth but not the work that creates it  that's how we've ended up with tax loopholes that allow companies to stash profits and ship jobs overseas  that's why we have seen tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest americans who don't need them and didn't ask for them  and that's why we're burdened with a tax code that's too complicated for ordinary folks to understand  but just complicated enough for washington lobbyists who know how to work the system  this philosophy is supported by an old brand of politics that uses understandable anti tax sentiment to shift the tax burden on to working people  meanwhile  the gaps in wealth grow wider and the costs to the middle class are greater  ceos make more in a day than their employees make in a year  our economy suffers through cycles of bubble and bust when the pain on main street trickles up to wall street  even before our current crisis  we went through the first sustained period of growth since world war ii that saw median incomes go down  so there will be a very clear choice in this election  john mccain will dust off the old political playbook that george bush used in the last two elections  and the disastrous tax policies that have failed the american people  i am running to lead this country in a new direction  we both favor tax cuts  the difference is that senator mccain wants to continue a bush tax code that rewards wealth  i want to reform our tax code so that it rewards work  that's why the typical middle class family will get three times more from my tax cut than the one john mccain has proposed  while nearly a quarter of his tax cuts go to households making over   million every year  that's right     million  that's where john mccain wants to focus his tax relief in this struggling economy  and senator mccain once knew better  he said that he couldn't vote for the bush tax cuts in good conscience because they were too skewed to the wealthiest americans  but now he wants to make those same tax cuts permanent  later  he said it was irresponsible to cut taxes during a time of war because we couldn't afford them  but now he'd continue running up hundreds of billions of dollars in debt while spending billions of dollars a day in iraq  there's nothing conservative about that  you know  i often say that john mccain is running to serve out george bush's third term  but when it comes to taxes that's not being fair to george bush  because the fact is  senator mccain is now calling for a new round of tax giveaways that are twice as expensive as the original bush plan and nearly twice as regressive  and he has no concrete plan to pay for it  he'd spend nearly   trillion over a decade in tax breaks for corporations  including   billion for exxon mobil  think about that  while you're paying four dollars at the pump and your children's future is being mortgaged under a mountain of debt  senator mccain wants to give billions of dollars in tax breaks to big oil  and opposes a windfall profits tax on oil companies like exxon to help families struggling with high energy costs  i think that's exactly what we need to change in washington  we can't keep driving a wider and wider gap between the few who are rich and the rest who struggle to keep pace  we can't keep pursuing policies that favor wall street over main street  because that approach ends up hurting both  it's time to turn the page  i will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  and put a tax cut into the pockets of working people  and struggling homeowners  and seniors  and we'll simplify our tax code so that folks don't have to work the system to get a fair deal  first  we will provide real tax relief for the middle class by cutting taxes for   million americans  we'll reward work through a  making work pay  tax credit of   for american workers   and   for working families like ryan and jenny's   to offset the payroll tax that you're already paying  this will give the middle class a break with rising costs while giving our economy a boost  and because this credit would be greater than their income tax bill  this would eliminate income taxes for   million americans  the second part of my plan eases the burden on struggling homeowners through a universal homeowner's tax credit  this will immediately benefit   million homeowners who don't itemize   including ryan and jenny   who will get a break of   percent off their mortgage interest rate  for most middle class families  this will add about   each year  and this credit will extend a hand to many of the millions of families stuck in the subprime crisis by giving them some breathing room to refinance or sell their homes  the third thing i'll do as president is keep our promise with america's seniors  since the new deal  we've had a basic understanding in this country  if you work hard and pay into the system  you've earned the right to a secure retirement  but even though seniors have held up their end of the bargain  many struggle to keep pace with costs  which can become a worry for an entire family  so i'll eliminate income taxes for all seniors making less than   this will eliminate income taxes for   million americans  at a savings rate of roughly   each year  seniors in this country should retire with the dignity and security they have earned  finally  it's time to cut through the complexity in our tax code  deductions and exemptions are built into the system  but ordinary people don't have the time to figure them out without paying for a tax preparer  when i'm president  we'll put in place a system where   million americans with a job and a bank account who take the standard deduction can do their taxes in less than five minutes  meanwhile  under john mccain  you could have to fill out three tax forms all using different tax rules just to pay your taxes  under my plan  there's no more worry  no more wasted time and expense  your pre prepared return will come to you in the mail  this will save americans more than   billion in tax preparer fees and more than   million hours of work  to pay for this  we'll restore a sense of fairness  that means standing up to the special interest carve outs  closing those corporate loopholes and tax breaks  and letting the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans expire  it's time for folks like me who make over   to pay our fair share  i am not afraid to have this debate about taxes and fairness   but let's be clear about what we're debating  if you are a family making less than   my plan will not raise your taxes   not your income taxes  not your payroll taxes  not your capital gains taxes  not any of your taxes  in fact chances are you will get a tax cut  and one that is larger than what senator mccain is proposing  it's time to grow our economy by renewing our stake in our common prosperity  it's time to end a philosophy in washington that tells people like ryan and jenny that  you're on your own  because we're all in this together as americans  most americans aren't asking for a lot  they don't need overseas tax shelters or a long list of loopholes  they just want a fair shake  and they could stand a break  my tax cut is guided by the simple principle that what's good for main street is good for our entire economy  that's how we'll get people the relief they need  while getting our economy back on the right track "], ["obama1", " i naleo opening statement i  i'm proud to be here today not just as the democratic nominee for president  but as the first african american nominee of my party  and i'm hoping that somewhere out in this audience sits the person who will become the first latino nominee of a major party  you know  being here today is a reminder of why i'm in this race  because the reason i'm running for president is to do what you do each day in your communities   help make a difference in the lives of ordinary americans  and that's what i've been working with latino leaders to do ever since i entered public service more than twenty years ago  we stood together when i was an organizer  lifting up neighborhoods in chicago that had been devastated when the local steel plants closed  we stood together when i was a civil rights attorney  working with maldef and local latino electeds to ensure that latinos were being well represented in chicago  and we marched together in the streets of chicago to fix our broken immigration system  that's why you can trust me when i say that i'll be your partner in the white house  and that's what you need now more than ever  because for eight long years  washington hasn't been working for ordinary americans  and few have been hit harder than latinos and african americans  you know what i'm talking about  you know folks like felicitas and fransisco  a couple i met in las vegas who were tricked into buying a home they couldn't afford  you know about the families all across this country who are out of work  or uninsured  or struggling to pay rising costs for everything from a tank of gas to a bag of groceries  and that's why you know that we need change in this country  and while i respect john mccain  it's not change when he offers four more years of bush economic policies that have failed to create jobs at a living wage  or insure our workers  or help americans afford the skyrocketing cost of college  that isn't change  now  one place where senator mccain used to offer change was on immigration  he was a champion of comprehensive reform  and i admired him for it  but when he was running for his party's nomination  he walked away from that commitment and he's said he wouldn't even support his own legislation if it came up for a vote  if we are going to solve the challenges we face  you need a president who will pursue genuine solutions day in and day out  and that is my commitment to you  we need immigration reform that will secure our borders  and punish employers who exploit immigrant labor  reform that finally brings the   million people who are here illegally out of the shadows by requiring them to take steps to become legal citizens  we must assert our values and reconcile our principles as a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws  that is a priority i will pursue from my very first day  and we can do something more  we can tear town the barriers that keep the american dream out of reach for so many americans  we can end the housing crisis and create millions of new jobs  we can make sure that the millions of latinos who are uninsured get the same health care that i get as a member of congress  we can improve our schools  recruit teachers to your communities  and make college affordable for anyone who wants to go  and we can finally start serving our brave latino fighting men and women and all our soldiers as well as they are serving us  we can do all this  si se puede  but i can't do this on my own  i need your help  this election could well come down to how many latinos turn out to vote  and i'm proud that my campaign is working hard to register more latinos  and bring them into the political process  because i truly believe that if we work together and fight together and stand together this fall  then you and i   together   will change this county and change this world   i the senator took questions after making his opening statement i   i naleo closing statement i  you know  a few years ago  i attended a naturalization workshop at st  pius church in chicago  and as i walked down the aisle  i saw people clutching small american flags  waiting for their turn to be called up so they could begin the long process to become u s  citizens  and at one point  a young girl  seven or eight  came up to me with her parents  and asked for my autograph  she said she was studying government in school and wanted to show it to her third grade class  i asked her what her name was  and she said her name was cristina  i told her parents they should be very proud of her  and as i watched cristina translate my words into spanish for them  i was reminded that for all the noise and anger that too often surrounds the immigration debate  america has nothing to fear from today's immigrants  they have come here for the same reason that families have always come here  for the same reason my father came here   for the hope that in america  they could build a better life for themselves and their families  like the waves of immigrants that came before them and the hispanic americans like ken salazar whose families have been here for generations  the recent arrival of latino immigrants will only enrich our country  ultimately  then  the danger to the american way of life is not that we will be overrun by those who do not look like us or do not yet speak our language  the danger will come if we fail to recognize the humanity of cristina and her family   if we withhold from them the opportunities we take for granted  and create a servant class in our midst  more broadly  the danger will come if we continue to stand idly by as the gap between wall street and main street grows  as washington grows more out of touch  and as america grows more unequal  because america can only prosper when all americans prosper   brown  black  white  asian  and native american  that's the idea that lies at the heart of my campaign  and that's the idea that will lie at the heart of my presidency  because we are all americans  todos somos americanos  and in this country  we rise and fall together "], ["obama1", "i've got to tell you  being here with all of you today feels a little like coming home  because while i stand here as a candidate for president of the united states  i will never forget that the most important experience in my life came when i was doing what you do each day   working on the ground in our communities to bring about change  as some of you know  after college  i moved to chicago and went to work for a group of churches to help families that had been devastated when the local steel plants closed down  i knew change in those communities wouldn't come easily   but i also knew it wouldn't come at all if we didn't start bringing people together  so i reached out to community leaders   black  brown  and white   and formed coalitions on issues ranging from failing schools to illegal dumping to unimmunized children  we set up job training for the jobless  helped prevent students from dropping out of school  and taught people to stand up to their government when it wasn't standing up for them  that work taught me a fundamental truth that has guided me ever since  that in this country  change doesn't come from the top down  change doesn't happen just because someone in washington says it should  change starts when you teach a child to read  or register someone to vote  or help a family buy their first home  it starts when you heal broken bodies and troubled spirits  when you organize neighborhoods into coalitions  and workers into unions  it starts when you send leaders to washington committed to taking this country in a new direction  that's the kind of change you're making every single day  the theme of this conference is the work of your lives  strengthening america together  it's been the work of this organization for four decades   lifting up families and transforming communities across america  and for that  i honor you  i congratulate you  i thank you  and i wish you another forty years as extraordinary as your last  i come before you today at a defining moment for our nation  i'm thinking of an article i read in the newspaper a while back about struggling schools in los angeles  the article told the story of a boy named gonzalo  who started falling behind in the seventh grade and wasn't getting the support he needed to catch up  when his mother called the school to complain  nothing changed   maybe the system is not designed for people like us  she said  not designed for people like us  it was a comment about education  but it reflects a broader feeling that so many people today share   that the system just isn't working for them  and they're right  it's not  the system isn't working when a child in a crumbling school graduates without learning to read or doesn't graduate at all  or when a young person at the top of her class   a young person with so much to offer this country   can't attend a public college  the system isn't working when hispanics are losing their jobs faster than almost anybody else  or working jobs that pay less  and come with fewer benefits than almost anybody else  the system isn't working when   million people live in hiding  and hundreds of thousands cross our borders illegally each year  when companies hire undocumented immigrants instead of legal citizens to avoid paying overtime or to avoid a union  when communities are terrorized by ice immigration raids   when nursing mothers are torn from their babies  when children come home from school to find their parents missing  when people are detained without access to legal counsel  when all that's happening  the system just isn't working  and i know how frustrated many of you are right now  your jobs are hard on a good day   and having a president who cuts your budgets doesn't help  having a president who's torn gaping holes in the safety net for the people you serve doesn't help  having a struggling economy   an economy that's left so many people in need of your assistance   that doesn't help either  i know that sometimes  you get tired  sometimes  you start to lose heart  you start to feel like you're walking that long  hard road alone   like no one sees the sacrifices you make or appreciates the services you provide  but i know how hard you're working  i know the difference you're making in our communities  and i'm here today to make you this promise  i will be a president who stands with you  and fights for you  and walks with you every step of the way  because here's something else i know  that when the system isn't working  people who love this country can come together to change it  that is the history of the hispanic community in america  from fighting to desegregate our schools and neighborhoods  to organizing farmworkers  to standing up for the rights of immigrants  you've reminded us that those words about liberty and equality put to paper over   years ago mean something  and you've sought to remake this nation in the shape of those ideals  it's work that reflects the character of this community in which so many people have come here with so little  but had big dreams  big hearts  and a thirst to succeed  a willingness to struggle and sacrifice so the next generation doesn't have to  it's the same reason my own father came here from kenya so many years ago   in the hope that here in america  you can make it if you try  for centuries  those values   hard work  patriotism  faith and family   the values that have made the hispanic community strong   have made america strong too  that's what's at stake this november  this election is nothing less than a test of our allegiance to the american dream  and it's a test of our commitment to all those who are counting on us to keep that dream alive   the people you serve every day  the   million people in the shadows  the communities taking immigration enforcement into their own hands  the neighborhoods seeing rising tensions as citizens are pitted against new immigrants they're counting on us to stop the hateful rhetoric filling our airwaves   rhetoric that poisons our political discourse  degrades our democracy  and has no place in this great nation  they're counting on us to rise above the fear and demagoguery  the pettiness and partisanship  and finally enact comprehensive immigration reform  now  i know senator mccain used to buck his party on immigration by fighting for comprehensive reform   and i admired him for it  but when he was running for his party's nomination  he abandoned his courageous stance  and said that he wouldn't even support his own legislation if it came up for a vote  well  i don't know about you  but i think it's time for a president who won't walk away from something as important as comprehensive reform when it becomes politically unpopular  and that's the commitment i'm making to you  i marched with you in the streets of chicago  i fought with you in the senate for comprehensive immigration reform  and i will make it a top priority in my first year as president  not just because we need to secure our borders and get control of who comes into our country  and not just because we have to crack down on employers abusing undocumented immigrants  but because we have to finally bring those   million people out of the shadows  yes  they broke the law  and we should not excuse that  we should require them to pay a fine  learn english  and go to the back of the line for citizenship   behind those who came here legally  but we cannot   and should not   deport   million people  that would turn american into something we're not  something we don't want to be  while we work to strengthen our borders  we need a practical solution for the problem of   million people who are here without documentation   many of whom have lived and worked here for years  that's why we need to offer those who are willing to make amends a pathway to citizenship  that way  we can reconcile our values as both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws  but there's much more to this election than resolving the status of undocumented immigrants  this election is also about the couple i met in north las vegas who saved up for decades only to be tricked into buying a home they couldn't afford  it's about the latino families who are the first ones hurt by an economic downturn and the last ones helped by an economic upturn  they can't afford another four years of the bush economic policies senator mccain is offering   policies that give tax breaks to the biggest corporations and the wealthiest americans  while doing little for struggling families who need help most  they're counting on us to restore fairness to our economy by giving tax relief to working families  by supporting our unions  by ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and giving them to companies that create jobs here at home  they're counting on us to finally come together to solve this housing crisis that's devastating our communities  i especially want to commend nclr for your leadership on this issue   for helping so many families avoid fraud and foreclosure  i think it's time you had a president who supported your work   and i intend to be that president  this election is also about the latino students who are dropping out of school faster than nearly anyone else  and the children who attend overflowing classes in underfunded schools taught by teachers who aren't getting the support they need  they're counting on us to invest in early childhood education  stop leaving the money behind for no child left behind  recruit an army of new teachers  and make college affordable for anyone who wants to go  because that's how we'll give every american the skills to compete in the global economy  and all our children the chance to live out their dreams  this election is about working women who can't find affordable childcare or afterschool programs for their kids  women forced to lose their wages or quit their jobs to care for a newborn baby or an elderly parent  they're counting on us to help them make a living while raising their kids   to fight for equal pay for equal work  and for childcare  family leave and sick leave  because here in america  there should be no second class citizens in our workplaces  this election is about the veterans   including so many men and women from this community   who've served this country so bravely  but then come home to face new battles with the bureaucracy at the va or the deplorable conditions at places like fort bragg and walter reed  and we've all walked by a veteran whose home is now a cardboard box on a street corner  it's a disgrace  these american heroes are counting on us to build a  st century va  to provide the benefits and health care they've earned  including mental health care  and to ensure that no one who has served this country ever has to sleep on the streets  this election is about the nearly one in three hispanics who don't have health care   people for whom one accident  one illness can lead to financial ruin  and it's about the small business owners struggling to stay afloat because of the rising cost of insuring their employees  they're counting on us to fix our broken health care system  here's senator mccain's answer to our health care crisis  vote against expanding the children's health insurance program   a program that provides health care for millions of children in need  and propose a radical plan that would shred our current system of employer based health care and tax individual workers for their health benefits for the first time in history  a plan that would be financed by a   trillion tax increase on the middle class   an increase of more than   for the typical family  under the mccain plan  many americans could lose the health care they have   and pay more in taxes for the health care they get  i have a very different answer to our health care crisis  i'll take on the drug and insurance companies  cut costs  guarantee health insurance for anyone who needs it and make it affordable for anyone who wants it  and today  i'm announcing my plan to provide real relief for small business owners crushed by rising costs  an idea championed by my friend hillary clinton  who's been leading the way in our battle to insure every american  it's a plan that would help more employers provide health benefits for their workers   instead of making it harder for them  as senator mccain would do  we know that small businesses are the engines of economic prosperity in our communities   particularly latino communities  and under my plan  if you're a small business that wants to provide health care to your employees  we'll give you a tax credit to make it affordable  my plan won't impose any new burdens on small businesses  instead  we'll help them not just create new jobs  but good jobs   jobs with health care  jobs that stay right here in america  the kind of jobs we need in our communities  that's how we're going to change the system in this country  but i can't do this alone  so i'm here today to ask for your help  make no mistake about it  the latino community holds this election in your hands  some of the closest contests this november will be in states like florida  colorado  nevada and new mexico   states with large latino populations  and if you have any doubt about whether you can make a difference  just remember how  back in     registered latino voters in new mexico didn't turn out on election day  senator kerry lost that state by fewer than   votes    votes  today  in   an estimated   latinos in new mexico aren't registered to vote  i know how powerful this community is  just think how powerful you could be on november  th if you translate your numbers into votes  and i'm not taking a single latino vote for granted in this campaign  we're meeting with latino leaders across the country  we're reaching out to latino organizations to get input on my policy proposals  we've got a nationwide hispanic media strategy  we're recruiting and training latino organizers  we're holding latino voter registration drives across america  and when i'm president  i'll be asking many of you to serve at every level of government  that's how we'll change the direction of this country   from the ground up  vote by vote  precinct by precinct  state by state  and i hope every single one of you will join us  i need your advice and expertise  i need you to organize people to knock on doors  make calls and register voters  i need you to talk to your friends and family  co workers and neighbors  and make sure they cast their ballots on election day  we walked together on the streets of the south side of chicago  we walked together when i was a civil rights lawyer  registering hispanic voters and giving hispanics a greater voice in city hall  we walked together in those marches for immigration reform  and if we get to the polls this november  we will walk together through those white house doors and into a new future for this country we all love  that's how we'll make the system work again for everyone  by living up to the ideals that this organization has always embodied   the ideals reflected in your name   la raza  the people  i'm told that the original phrase was  la raza cosmica    the cosmic people   a term big enough to embrace the rich tapestry of cultures  colors and faiths that make up the hispanic community  big enough to embrace the notion that we are all part of a greater community   that we all have a stake in each other  that i am my brother's keeper  i am my sister's keeper  and we rise and fall together as one people  so to that mother and all those who feel like the system just isn't made for people like you  i say this  that system and this country belong to every last one of us  black and white  latino and asian  rich and poor  gay and straight  young and old  and this november  we're going to come together to turn the page on the failed policies of the past  to bring new energy and new ideas to meet the challenges we face  and together  we won't just win an election   we will transform this nation  thank you  and god bless you "], ["obama1", "i've often said that this election is a defining moment in our history  on major issues like the war in iraq or the warming of our planet  the decisions we make in november and over the next few years will shape a generation  if not a century  nowhere is that more true than when it comes to our economy   just today  we learned that   jobs were lost last month alone  the seventh straight month of job loss   now totaling over   jobs lost since the beginning of this year  this follows yesterday's news that in the last year  wages and benefits fell further behind inflation than at any time in over twenty five years  meanwhile  gas prices are out of control  food prices are soaring  if you're lucky enough to have health care  your copays  deductibles  and premiums are skyrocketing  college is becoming less affordable  and we've seen more foreclosures than at any time since the great depression  back in the  s  your incomes grew by   and over the last several years  they've actually fallen by nearly    so for many families  these anxieties are getting worse  not better  people are starting to lose faith in the american dream  which is the idea that if you work hard  you can build a better life not just for yourselves but for your children and grandchildren  a lot of people feel like that dream is slipping further out of reach  that's why i'm running for president of the united states   because america is supposed to be the place where you can make it if you try  and a lot of people are trying  but they're having a tough time making it  part of it has to do with changes in the way our economy works  over the last few decades  revolutions in technology and communication have made it so that corporations can send good jobs wherever there's an internet connection  children in st  petersburg aren't just growing up competing for good jobs with children in boston or chicago  but with children in beijing and bangalore   but what we also have to remember is that our economic problems aren't simply due to changes in how our economy works  and they aren't just a normal part of the business cycle  they're also due to irresponsible decisions that were made on wall street and in washington  in recent years  we have relearned the essential truth that in the long run  we cannot have a thriving wall street and a struggling main street  when wages are flat  prices are rising  and more americans are mired in debt  the economy as a whole suffers  when a reckless few game the system  as we've seen in this housing crisis  millions suffer and we're all affected  when special interests put their thumb on the scale  and distort the free market  the people who compete by the rules come in last  and when our government fails to meet its obligation   to provide sensible oversight and stand on the side of working people and invest in their future   america pays a heavy price  so we have a choice to make in this election  we can either choose a new direction for our economy  or we can keep doing what we've been doing  my opponent believes we're on the right course  he's said our economy has made great progress these past eight years  he's embraced the bush economic policies and promises to continue them  well  our country and families in florida cannot afford to keep doing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result  that's a gamble we just can't take  it's time for something new  it's time to restore balance and fairness to our economy so it works for all americans  that's why as president  i will put a middle class tax cut into the pockets of   of workers  provide relief to struggling homeowners  and eliminate income taxes for seniors making less than   a year  and i'll end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and give them to companies that create good jobs here at home  but you can't wait that long  you need immediate relief  now  i've already called for a stimulus package on two different occasions this year  and much of what i've proposed has passed in congress  these efforts have made some difference  but with job losses mounting  prices rising  increased turbulence in our financial system  and a growing credit crunch  we need to do more  i discussed these issues with my top economic advisers at a meeting on monday and we agreed that the main risk we face today is doing too little in the face of our growing economic troubles  that's why today  i'm announcing a two part emergency plan to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track   the first part of my plan is a   emergency energy rebate that could go out to families as soon as this fall  this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next   months  or  if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter  it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills  or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt  as we provide relief  we must also be mindful of the swelling budget deficit  that is why i am proposing that we pay for this rebate by taxing the windfall profits of oil companies like exxon mobil   a company that announced yesterday that it made nearly   billion last quarter  more than any u s  corporation has ever made in a single quarter  it's time we used some of their record profits to help you pay record prices   the second part of my plan is a   billion stimulus to help jump start job creation and help local communities that are struggling due to our economic downturn  half of this stimulus will go to state governments that are facing big budget shortfalls  when state governments are forced to cut spending on essential services like police or firefighters  it doesn't just undermine the safety of our communities  it makes our economic problems even worse  by offering   billion to state governments  we can help ensure that they don't have to let workers go or freeze their salaries or raise property taxes on families who are hurting  and we can also help ensure that they continue providing foreclosure counseling and other services to help families stay in their homes in areas that have been hard hit by our housing crisis  we'll invest the other half of this   billion in our national infrastructure so we can create new jobs and save over one million jobs that are in danger of being cut  with construction costs rising  the highway trust fund is facing a deficit for the first time ever   and that means that current infrastructure projects are being delayed and new ones are being postponed  this is part of the reason we've lost   jobs in the construction industry in recent years  so what we'll do is replenish the trust fund and make a down payment on my plan to create a national infrastructure bank to rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges  we'll also invest some of this money to repair our crumbling schools   because that won't just help make sure our children are getting a world class education  it will spur job growth and boost our local economies  now my opponent has a very different economic philosophy  he's proposing to cut the gasoline tax paid by the oil companies and trust that they will pass on the savings in the form of lower prices at the pump  it's a plan that strips   billion from our highway construction funds  which means we will lose over   construction jobs  and he's also proposing tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest americans in the hope that a little bit of it will trickle down to you  well  i do not believe that giving   billion in new tax cuts to oil companies   including   billion to exxon mobil alone   will create any jobs or save you any money  instead  i believe america is at its strongest when our economy is growing from the bottom up  if we want relief for families  we should give relief to families  if we want to create jobs  we should do more to make work pay for ordinary americans  that's what my plan does   because that's how we'll bring america the change we need right now  but we have to do more than just provide short term relief  we have to secure our long term prosperity and strengthen america's competitiveness in the  st century  it won't be easy  it won't happen overnight  but i refuse to accept that we cannot meet the challenges of our global economy  i'm running for president because i believe we can seize our own economic destiny  but we do have a choice to make in november  we can choose to go another four years without truly solving our energy crisis  or we can make america energy independent so we're less vulnerable to oil price shocks and   a gallon gas  we can build an american green energy sector by investing in renewable energies like wind power  solar power  and the next generation biofuels  and we can create up to five million new green jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  that's what we can choose to do in this election  we can choose to go another four years with the same reckless fiscal policies that have busted our budget  wreaked havoc in our economy  and mortgaged our children's future on a mountain of debt  or we can restore fiscal responsibility in washington by starting to wind down a war in iraq that's costing   billion a month  by cutting wasteful spending  by shutting corporate loopholes and tax havens  and by rolling back the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  we can go another four years with a broken health care system  or we can say that if we're spending more money on health care per capita than any other nation on earth  we shouldn't have   million people without health care  we shouldn't have families going bankrupt just because they got sick  we shouldn't have businesses struggling to stay afloat because they can't afford rising health care costs  we should be guaranteeing health care for anyone who wants it  making it affordable for anyone who needs it  and cutting costs for businesses and their workers by picking up the tab for some of the most expensive illnesses and conditions  and that's what we'll do by the end of my first term as president of the united states  we can choose to stay mired in the same education debate that's consumed washington for decades  or we can provide every child with a quality education so they have the skills to succeed in our global economy  we can invest in early childhood education  recruit an army of qualified teachers with better pay and more support  and finally make college affordable by offering an annual   tax credit in exchange for community or national service  america will invest in you  you'll invest in america  and together  we'll move this country forward  these are the choices we face in november  and yet  instead of talking about these real choices  my opponent is running an increasingly negative campaign that's distorting my record and using the same old washington political attacks that are trotted out every four years  just yesterday  your own st  petersburg times wrote that their campaign has taken a  nasty turn into the gutter  the american people deserve better  you deserve a serious discussion about our nation's challenges  and you deserve real solutions to our economic problems   solutions that will help ensure that here in this country  opportunity is open to anyone who's willing to work for it  in the end  that's all most americans are asking for  it's not a lot  you don't expect government to solve all your problems  you want to be self reliant and independent  you want to be responsible for your own lives and take care of your own families  but what you do expect is a government that isn't run by the special interests  what you do expect is that if you're willing to work  you should be able to find a job that pays a decent wage  that you shouldn't go bankrupt when you get sick  and that you should be able to send your child to college even if you're not rich  you do expect that you should be able to retire with dignity and respect   that's what you should expect  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  and if you're willing to stand with me and work with me and vote for me  then we will not just win florida  we will win this election  and then you and i together will change this country and change this world "], ["obama1", "hi  everybody  thank you  bill  for that warm introduction  and for your friendship and leadership  i want to acknowledge evelyn gooden  the illinois aarp state president  for her years of devoted service to the people of my home state  and congratulations to all of you in the aarp on fifty years of fighting tirelessly to improve the lives of those over fifty  for generations  we have worked to keep a simple promise in this country   that those who have worked hard their entire lives have the right to retire with dignity and security  that is the promise my grandparents knew  when my grandfather returned from serving his country in world war ii  he was able to go to college on the gi bill  buy their first house with a loan from the federal government  and set out west from kansas to build their lives with the confidence that they could reach a secure retirement  that is the promise that michelle's parents knew  after her father passed away  her mother was able to live comfortably due in part to his pension as a shiftworker  that was the promise that fdr made  and it was a promise that washington kept for decades while folks like my grandparents and michelle's parents moved through the ups and downs of middle class life  but today  that promise feels like it's slowly slipping away  you feel this in your own lives  more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less  more have lost their homes and more are watching their home values plummet  you're paying college tuition that's beyond your reach while supporting your aging parents  and as you plan for your future  you're finding it's harder to save and it's harder to retire  that's because  for eight long years  there's been a very different philosophy in the white house  they call it the ownership society  but what it really means is you're on your own  job shipped overseas  tough luck  pension disappeared  that's the breaks  no health care  the emergency room will fix it  you're on your own  now  let there be no doubt  the republican nominee  john mccain  has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction  and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect  but the record's clear  john mccain has voted with george bush   percent of the time  and i don't know about you  but i'm not ready to take a   percent chance on change  and since he's not offering much change  that's why you didn't hear much about his plans for the future this week  you didn't hear much about their health care plan that would actually tax your benefits for the first time ever  or about their plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement  or how they plan to fix the economy they've ruined or help you live comfortably in your later years  because  in the words of john mccain's campaign manager  this election  isn't about the issues  well i'm running for president because i believe this election is all about the issues  it's not about me  or john mccain  it's about you  it's about your lives  it's about your future  and securing your future starts with protecting social security   today  tomorrow and forever  now  john mccain said that the way social security works is  and i quote   an absolute disgrace  wrong  for millions of americans  it's the very difference between a comfortable retirement and falling into poverty  more than half of seniors depend on it for more than half of their income  and as the first baby boomers become eligible for benefits this year  there are steps we can take to secure its future for generations to come  that doesn't mean embracing george bush's failed privatization scheme  as john mccain has  privatizing social security was a bad idea when george bush proposed it  and it's a bad idea today  it would take the one rock solid  guaranteed part of your retirement income and gamble it on the stock market  that's why i stood with aarp against this plan in the senate  and that's why i won't stand for it as president  but his campaign has gone even further  suggesting that the best answer to the growing pressures on social security might be to cut cost of living adjustments or raise the retirement age  i will not do either  there's another option that is fairer to working men and women without putting the burden on those who have already earned it  right now  the social security payroll tax is capped  that means most middle class families pay this tax on every dime they make  while millionaires and billionaires only pay it on a very small percentage of their income  that's why i'll work with members of congress from both parties to ask people making more than   a year to contribute a little bit more to keep the system sound  it's a change that would start a decade or more from now  and it won't burden middle class families  in fact    of americans will see absolutely no change in their taxes     now  even if we keep social security strong for future generations  it's still not enough to help seniors on fixed incomes who are struggling with the rising cost of everything from gas to groceries  that's why i'll make retirement more secure by eliminating income taxes for retirees making less than   per year  this would completely eliminate income taxes for   million seniors  and i will cut taxes   cut taxes   for   of all working families in this country  now is the time to give the middle class a break  now is the time to finally provide affordable  accessible health care for every single american   because you shouldn't have to worry about being one illness away from bankruptcy  if you like the health care you have  you'll see lower premiums under my plan  if you don't have health care  you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer  i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most  now is the time to also strengthen and preserve medicare  and these reforms will do just that  in addition  i will allow the government to negotiate with drug companies to lower costs for seniors  and we'll allow reimportation of drugs from other countries and ensure their safety  lowering costs for all consumers  now is the time to help families care for their aging parents by enacting a real long term care plan that lowers costs and guarantees that all americans receive quality care in their later years  to end the outrage of ceos cashing out while workers watch their pensions disappear  to encourage savings  investment and wealth creation for our younger workers by enacting automatic workplace pensions  as president  these are the policies i will pursue so that older americans can continue living the longer  better  more productive lives that they have every right to expect  aarp  that's how we'll renew americans' confidence in a secure retirement  that's the change we need  but i need your help to make it happen  so if you're ok with the next four years looking just like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want change   if you want to restore that fundamental promise we've made from generation to generation  then i ask you to give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will change this country together "], ["obama1", "the era of greed and irresponsibility on wall street and in washington has led us to a perilous moment  they said they wanted to let the market run free but instead they let it run wild  and in doing so  they tramped our core values of fairness  balance  and responsibility to one another  as a result  we are facing a financial crisis as profound as any we have faced since the great depression  as a result  your jobs  your savings  and your economic security are now at risk  this week  we must work quickly  in a bipartisan fashion  to resolve this crisis and avert an even broader economic catastrophe  and as we do act  washington must recognize that true economic recovery requires addressing not just the crisis on wall street  but the crisis on main street that so many of you have been feeling in your own lives long before the news of last week  we need a plan that helps families stay in their homes  and workers keep their jobs  a plan that gives hardworking americans relief instead of using taxpayer dollars to reward ceos on wall street  and we cannot give a blank check to washington with no oversight and accountability when no oversight and accountability is what got us into this mess in the first place  but no matter what solution we finally decide on this week  it is absolutely imperative that we get to work immediately on reforming the broken politics and the broken government that allowed this to crisis to happen in the first place  we did not arrive at this moment by some accident of history  we are in this mess because of a bankrupt philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to the rest of us  we're here because for too long  the doors of washington have been thrown open to an army of lobbyists and special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play   who have shredded consumer protections  fought against common sense regulations and rules of the road  and distorted our economy so that it works for them instead of you  we are here because an ethic of irresponsibility has swept through our government  leaving politicians with the belief that they can waste billions and billions of your money on no bid contracts for friends and contributors  slip pork projects into bills during the dead of night  and spend billions on corporate tax breaks we can't afford and old programs that we don't need  and today  even as congress debates an emergency plan to save our economy from the verge of collapse  there are reports that lobbyists and ceos are already lining up to figure out what's in it for them  to find out how they can get theirs  green bay  enough is enough  i began this race for the presidency as the one candidate who hasn't spent a lot of time learning the ways of washington  but i've been there long enough to know this   if we want a government that puts the needs of middle class families before the whims of lobbyists and politicians  if we want to grow this economy and prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again  then the ways of washington must change  we must reform our lobbyist driven politics  we must reform the waste and abuse in our government  we must reform the rules of the road that let wall street run wild and stuck main street with the bill  we must change washington now  this has been our message from the day we began this campaign  our opponent  on the other hand  has spent much of the last nineteen months arguing that what qualifies him to be president are the decades he's spent in washington  but with forty two days left  he's had a sudden change of heart  an election time conversion  after twenty six years in washington   years where he voted for the same trickle down  on your own policies that got us into this mess   he now claims that he's the one who can clean it up  well let's be clear  when it comes to regulatory reform  senator mccain has fought time and time again against the common sense rules of the road that could've prevented this crisis  his economic plan was written by phil gramm  the architect in the us senate of the de regulatory steps that helped cause this mess  even knowing what we know now  senator mccain said in an interview just last night that de regulation actually helped grow our economy  well that might be true for the profits of a few ceos  but it's certainly not true for america's prosperity  when it comes to taking on the special interests  my opponent sounds like fighting bob lafollette  but he acts like a guy who's spent three decades of his life in washington  he's put seven of the biggest corporate lobbyists in charge of his campaign   lobbyists for the insurance industry and the oil industry  for foreign governments and freddie and fannie mac  who paid his campaign manager nearly   million to defend them against stricter regulations  i guess they got their money's worth  and rest assured  those lobbyists who are working day and night to elect my opponent aren't doing it to put themselves out of business  when it comes to reforming government waste and spending  senator mccain talks a lot about earmarks  and while he deserves credit for not requesting many of those earmarks during his time in congress  what he never mentions is that he voted for   billion dollars worth in just six years  or that he voted for four out of the five bush budgets that have been filled with special interests giveaways and left us with the largest deficit in history  the truth is  our earmark system in washington is fraught with abuse  it badly needs reform   which is why i didn't request a single earmark last year  why i've released all my previous requests for the public to see  and why i've pledged to slash earmarks by more than half when i am president  but let's not pretend  as john mccain does  that proposing the elimination of   billion dollars of earmarks will make up for the more than   billion additional dollars he wants to spend on tax breaks for big corporations and multi millionaires that don't need them and weren't asking for them   more than   billion dollars at a time when taxpayers are being asked to help finance two wars and a historic financial bailout  that's some pretty creative math  but it doesn't add up to is change  and change in washington is what we need right now  this change will not be easy  it will require reforming our politics by taking power away from the lobbyists who kill good ideas and good plans with secret meetings and campaign checks  it will require reforming our government by taking on the spending habits of both parties and going after the tax havens and loopholes that big corporations use to avoid paying their fare share while you pay more  and it will require reforming our out dated  unfair regulatory system that favors wall street over main street but has ended up hurting both  but i am ready to reform our politics because i've done it before  i've spent my career taking on lobbyists and their money  and i've won  when i was a state senator in illinois  if you wanted a favor  there was actually a law that let you give campaign cash to politicians for their own personal use  in the state house  they called it business as usual  i called it legalized bribery  and while it didn't make me the most popular guy in springfield  i put an end to it  i brought democrats and republicans together  and we passed the first ethics reform in twenty five years  when i got to washington  jack abramoff and his lobbyist pals had engaged in some of the worst corruption since watergate  i led the fight for reform in my party  and let me tell you   not everyone in my party was too happy about it  when i proposed forcing lobbyists to disclose who they're raising money from and who in congress they're funneling it to  i had a few choice words directed my way on the floor of the senate  but we got it done  and we banned gifts from lobbyists  and discounted rides on their corporate jets  and i'm the only candidate in this race who can say that washington lobbyists do not fund my campaign  you do   with donations of   and   and   i also joined with one of the most conservative republicans in congress to end the abuse that allowed no bid contracts to waste taxpayer dollars instead of using them to rebuild the gulf coast after katrina  and we worked together to put the federal government's checkbook online   so you can see how and where washington is spending trillions of dollars of your money  for years  i have also pushed for reform of the same loose regulations and lax oversight that could've prevented the crisis we're in  it was two years ago that i introduced legislation to stop mortgage transactions that promoted fraud  risk or abuse  it was one year ago that i called on our treasury secretary and our fed chairman to bring every stakeholder together and find a solution to the subprime mortgage meltdown before it got worse  in march  when john mccain was saying  i'm always for less regulation  i called for a new   st century regulatory framework to restore accountability  transparency  and trust in our financial markets  these are the types of reform i will pursue beginning on my very first day in office as president of the united states   political reform  government reform  and regulatory reform  first  i'll reform our special interest driven politics  when i am president  i will start by closing the revolving door in the white house that has allowed people to use their administration job as a stepping stone to further their lobbying careers  i'll make it absolutely clear that working in an obama administration is not about serving your former employer  your future employer  or your bank account   it's about serving your country  when you walk into my administration  you will not be able to work on regulations or contracts directly related to your former employer for two years  and when you leave  you will not be able to lobby my administration   ever  i will also institute an absolute gift ban so that no registered lobbyist can curry favor with members of my administration based on how much they can spend on a fancy dinner  i'll make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business is the people's business  as justice louis brandeis once said  sunlight is the greatest disinfectant  as president  i will make it impossible for congressmen or lobbyists to slip pork barrel projects or corporate welfare into laws when no one is looking because when i am president  meetings where laws are written will be more open to the public  no more secrecy  when there is a bill that ends up on my desk as president  you will have five days to look online and find out what's in it before i sign it  when there are meetings between lobbyists and a government agency  we will put as many as possible online for every american to watch  when there is a tax bill being debated in congress  you will know the names of the corporations that would benefit and how much money they would get  and we will put every corporate tax break and every pork barrel project online for every american to see  you will know who asked for them and you can cast your vote accordingly  the second set of reforms i'll make will eliminate the waste  fraud  and abuse in our government  we are facing the largest deficit in history  we are facing the largest government bailout in history  and we are also facing some of the greatest challenges in our history  all of this will cost money   to fix our health care system  and our schools  and build a new energy economy  and the only way we can do all this without leaving our children with an even larger debt is if washington starts taking responsibility for every dime that it spends  we can start by ending a war in iraq that is costing us   billion a month when the iraqi government is sitting on a   billion surplus  we should also stop sending fifteen billion dollars a year in overpayments to insurance companies for medicare and go after tens of billions of dollars in medicare and medicaid fraud  we need to stop sending three billion a year to banks that provide student loans the government could provide for less  and hundreds of millions a year in subsidies to agribusiness that can survive just fine without your tax dollars and use some of the money to help family farmers who are struggling  i will put an end to this waste when i am president  i am not a democrat who believes that we can or should defend every government program just because it's there  there are some that don't work like we had hoped   like the bush administration's billion dollar a year reading program that hasn't improved our children's reading  and there are some that have been duplicated by other programs that we just need to cut back   like waste at the economic development agency and the export import bank that has become little more than a fund for corporate welfare  i understand there are parts of these programs worth defending and politicians of both parties who will do so  but if we hope to meet the challenges of our time  we must make difficult choices  as president  i will go through the entire federal budget  page by page  line by line  and i will eliminate the programs that don't work and aren't needed  as for the programs we do need  i will make them work better and cost less  i will create a high performance team that evaluates every agency and every office based on how well they're serving the american taxpayer  we will fire government managers who aren't getting results  we will cut funding for programs that are wasting your money  and we will use technology and lessons from the private sector to improve efficiency across every level of government   because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy  i will also save billions of dollars by cutting private contractors and improving management of the hundreds of billions of dollars our government spends on private contracts  and i will end the abuse of no bid contracts for good  one employee of a former halliburton subsidiary actually admitted that he was ordered to put his company's logo on towels provided to u s  troops because our government   our tax dollars   would pay for it no matter how much it cost  that is wasteful  that is wrong  and that will end when i am president  and for all his talk about earmark abuse  what senator mccain doesn't mention these days is the corporate abuse of our tax system   abuse that has cost far more than earmarks ever have  in   loopholes and tax breaks allowed   major corporations to actually have negative tax liabilities  we lose   billion every year because corporations get to set up mailboxes offshore so they can avoid paying a dime of taxes in america  imagine if you got to do that  there is a building right now in the cayman islands that is the address for   corporations  well that is either the biggest building in the world or the biggest sham in the world  and i think we know which one it is  i will shut down those offshore tax havens and all those corporate loopholes as president  because you shouldn't have to pay higher taxes because some big corporation cut corners to avoid paying theirs  all of us have a responsibility to pay our fair share  that's putting country first  finally  the third set of reforms i will pursue are the updated  common sense regulations of the financial market that i've been calling for since march  rules of the road that will make wall street fair  open  and honest  that will ensure a crisis like this can never happen again  i've outlined six principles that such reforms should follow  first  if you're a financial institution that can borrow from the government  you should be subject to government oversight and supervision  taxpayers who have now been called upon to spend nearly a trillion dollars to save our economy from the excesses of wall street have every right to expect that financial institutions are not taking excessive risks  second  we need to reform requirements on all regulated financial institutions  investigate rating agencies and potential conflicts of interest with the people they are rating  and establish transparency requirements that demand full disclosure by financial institutions to shareholders  third  we need to streamline our overlapping and competing regulatory agencies that cannot oversee the large and complex institutions that dominate the financial landscape  fourth  we need to regulate institutions for what they do  not what they are  over the last few years  commercial banks and thrift institutions were subject to guidelines on subprime mortgages that did not apply to mortgage brokers and companies  this regulatory framework failed to protect homeowners  and made no sense for our financial system  fifth  we need to crack down on trading activity that crosses the line to market manipulation  we need regulators that actually enforce the rules instead of overlooking them  the sec should investigate and punish all market manipulation  sixth  we must establish a process that identifies systemic risks to the financial system like the crisis that has overtaken our economy  we need a standing financial market advisory group to meet regularly and provide advice to the president  congress  and regulators on the state of our financial markets and the risks they face  it's time to anticipate risks before they erupt into a full blown crisis  these are the principles that should guide the reforms we need to establish a  st century regulatory system   a system that recognizes our free market economy has only worked because we have guided the market's invisible hand with a higher principle   that america prospers when all americans can prosper  to restore this prosperity  we must change washington  we must reform our regulations  our politics  and our government  but we will not be able to make these changes with the same policies  the same lobbyists  or the same washington culture that allows politicians and special interests to set their own agenda  that's exactly what we will get from john mccain  after twenty six years of being part of this washington culture  all that he has changed is his slogan for the fall campaign  and the people in charge of that campaign prove that if we elect john mccain  it's not a team of mavericks we'll be sending to the white house   it's a team of lobbyists  we can't afford four more years of that kind of politics  we need real change  it won't be easy  the kind of change we're looking for never is  what we are up against is a very powerful  entrenched status quo in washington who will say anything and do anything and fight with everything they've got to keep things just the way are  but i feel good about our chances  because i've got something more powerful than they do  i've got you  in this campaign  you have already shown what history teaches us   that at defining moments like this one  the change we need doesn't come from washington  change comes to washington  change has always come from places like wisconsin   the state where the progressive movement was born  where laws were passed to regulate the railroads and insurance companies  laws that protected consumers and the safety of factory workers  it was a movement rooted in a principle that was known as the wisconsin idea   the idea that government works best in the hands of the people  not the special interests  that your voices should speak louder than the whispers of lobbyists  that's the wisconsin idea  that's the america idea  and that's the kind of government we need right now  so if you want the next four years in washington to look just like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want to shine a bright light into the backrooms of washington  if you want to replace the special interests with your interests  if you want a government that costs less and works better for everyday americans  then i ask you to knock on some doors  and make some calls  and talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will change america together  thank you "], ["obama1", "you know  there were a lot of noteworthy moments in that debate  but there's one that sticks out this morning  it's when governor palin said to joe biden that our plan to get our economy out of the ditch was somehow a job killing plan  i wonder if she turned on the news this morning  because it was just reported that america has experienced its ninth straight month of job loss  just since january  we've lost more than   jobs across america    in pennsylvania alone  this is the economy that john mccain said   just two weeks ago   was fundamentally strong  this is the economy that my opponent said made great progress under the policies of george w  bush  and those are the economic policies that he proposes to continue for another four years  so when senator mccain and his running mate talk about job killing  that's something they know a thing or two about  because the policies they're supporting are killing jobs every single day  well  abington  i am here to tell you that we cannot afford four more years of this  because where i come from  there's nothing more fundamental than having the sense of meaning and purpose that comes with showing up at work in the morning  there's nothing more fundamental than being able to put your kids through college  or having health care when you get sick  or being able to retire with security  there's nothing more fundamental than a good paying job  that's why we're here today   because we need to do what we did in the  s and create millions of new jobs and not lose them  we need to do what we did in the  s and make sure people's incomes are going up and not down  we need to do what a guy named bill clinton did in the  s and put people first again  that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  we've tried it their way  it hasn't worked  and it won't work now  but let me tell you what will work  what will work is investing   billion a year over the next decade in renewable sources of energy like wind and solar   an investment that will generate five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced  and by the way  we can end our dependence on foreign oil in the process  and nothing will help our economy more than that  what will work is making an investment in rebuilding our crumbling roads  schools  and bridges  that will mean jobs for two million more americans  my opponent supports giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  but what will work is giving those tax breaks to companies that create jobs here at home  my opponent supports tax havens that let companies avoid paying taxes here in america   tax havens that cost   billion every year  but what will work is shutting those tax havens and closing corporate loopholes  what will work is giving tax breaks to the small businesses that are the engine of economic growth in this country  and cutting taxes   hear me now   cutting taxes   for   percent of all working families  under my plan  tax rates will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  that's what will work  and that's the kind of change joe biden and i are going to bring to washington  now  let me be perfectly clear  the fact that our economy is in this mess is an outrage  it's an outrage because we did not get here by accident  this was not a normal part of the business cycle  this did not happen because of a few bad apples  this financial crisis is a direct result of the greed and irresponsibility that has dominated washington and wall street for years  it's the result of an economic philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  a philosophy that views even the most common sense regulations as unwise and unnecessary  well  this crisis is nothing less than a final verdict on this failed philosophy   and it's a philosophy that will end when i'm president of the united states  that's what this election is all about  because despite my opponent's best efforts to make you think otherwise  this is the philosophy he's embraced during his twenty six years in washington  and it shows just how out of touch he really is  how else could he offer   billion in tax cuts for big corporations at a time like this  how else could he propose giving the average fortune   ceo a   tax cut at a time when millions of americans are struggling to pay their bills  how else could he come up with an economic plan that leaves out more than   million middle class taxpayers  senator mccain just doesn't get it  well  abington  i do get it  and i think all of you get it too  we know these are difficult times  we know how bad pennsylvania has been hurting  but here's what i also know   i know we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  because that's who we are  because that's what americans do  this is a nation that's faced tougher times than these   we've faced war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we've risen to meet these challenges because we've never forgotten that fundamental truth   that here  in this country  our destiny is not written for us  it's written by us  here  in the united states of america  the future is ours to shape  that's what we need to do right now  part of what that means is passing the rescue plan that's before congress  this is a plan that will help us deal with this immediate crisis and put our economy on a firmer footing  it's a plan i voted for the other night   because i made sure it included taxpayer protections and wasn't simply a blank check like this administration initially asked for  and it's a plan that the house is going to be voting on soon  so to democrats and republicans in the house who are now on the fence  let me say this  do not make the same mistake twice  for the sake of our families  our economy  and our country  step up to the plate and pass this plan  but understand  even with this plan  we may face a long and difficult road to recovery  that's why  if i'm president  passing this rescue plan won't be the end of what we do to strengthen our economy  it'll be the beginning  it'll be the beginning of a long term rescue plan for our middle class   a plan that will put opportunity within reach for anyone who's willing to fight for it  now  some people have asked whether our weakening economy means the next president will have to scale back his agenda  but i reject the idea that you can't build a strong middle class at a time when our economy is weak  because i've got a different economic philosophy than john mccain   i believe that building a strong middle class is the key to making our economy strong  and that's what we'll do when i'm president of the united states  so yes  we'll create millions of new jobs  and yes  we'll put more money back into the pockets of hardworking families  but we'll also do something more  we will reform our health care system so we can relieve families  businesses  and our economy from the crushing cost of health care by investing in new technology and preventative care  if you have health care  my plan will lower your premiums  if you don't  you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  and we're going to stand up to the insurance companies  this is personal for me  my mother died when she was   from ovarian cancer  and you know what she was doing in her final months  she was in her hospital bed arguing with insurance companies about whether or not it was a preexisting condition  so i know the pain that's caused by our broken health care system  and that's why as president  i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most  and another thing we know will work in the long term is to make sure that our education system is second to none so that every child in america has the skills they'll need to compete for high wage jobs in the  st century  i've laid out a comprehensive plan to get there that will give our kids the opportunities they deserve  when i spoke about that plan a while back  senator mccain's top education advisor said that this isn't an issue he's been focused on  well  let me tell you  if you want to create jobs and grow this economy in the  st century  you had better focus on education  because we know that countries that out teach us today will outcompete us tomorrow  finally  i will modernize our outdated financial regulations and put in place the common sense rules of the road i've been calling for since march   rules that will keep our market free  fair  and honest  rules that will restore accountability and responsibility in the boardroom  and make sure wall street can never get away with the stunts that caused this crisis again  but just as we demand accountability on wall street  we must also demand it in washington  that's why i'm not going to stand here and simply tell you what i'm going to spend  i'm going to tell you how we're going to save when i am president  i'll do what you do in your own family budgets and make sure we're spending money wisely  i will go through the entire federal budget  page by page  line by line  and eliminate programs that don't work and aren't needed  we'll start by ending a war in iraq that's costing   billion a month while the iraqi government sits on a   billion surplus  and we'll save billions more by cutting waste  improving management  and strengthening oversight  these are the changes and reforms we need  a new era of responsibility and accountability on wall street and in washington  common sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again  investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the  st century  bottom up growth that gives every american a fair shot at the american dream  i won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever  we are all in this together  what this crisis has taught us is that at the end of the day  there is no real separation between main street and wall street  there is only the road we're traveling on as americans   and we will rise or fall on that journey as one nation  as one people  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  this is one of those moments  i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics  i understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what's been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history  i ask you to believe   to believe in yourselves  in each other  and in the future we can build together  together  we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  or pay their bills at the end of the month  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves we can do this  americans have done this before  some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  together  we cannot fail  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will win pennsylvania  we will win this election  and then you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "we meet at a moment of great uncertainty for america  the economic crisis we face is the worst since the great depression  as the stock market has plummeted  millions of americans have opened up their  k  statements to see that so much of their hard earned savings have disappeared  the credit crisis has left businesses large and small unable to get loans  which means they can't buy new equipment  or hire new workers  or even make payroll for the workers they have  in households across the country  it's getting harder and harder to get a loan for that new car or that startup business or that college you've dreamed of attending  wages are lower than they've been in nearly a decade  you're paying more for everything from gas to groceries  but your paychecks have flat lined  i know these are difficult times  i know folks are worried  but i believe that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis because i believe in this country  because this is the united states of america  this is a nation that has faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  the american story has never been about things coming easy   it's been about rising to the moment when the moment is hard  america can meet this moment  we have the most talented  most productive workers of any country on earth  we're home to innovation and technology  colleges and universities that are the envy of the world  some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and research facilities  it won't be easy  but there's no reason we can't make this century another american century  but virginia  i also know this  it will take a new direction  it will take new leadership in washington  it will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  even as we face the most serious economic crisis of our time  even as you are worried about keeping your jobs or paying your bills or staying in your homes  my opponent's campaign announced earlier this month that they want to  turn the page  on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead  senator mccain's campaign actually said  and i quote   if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  well  virginia  here's what senator mccain doesn't seem to understand  with the economy in turmoil and the american dream at risk  the american people don't want to hear politicians attack each other   you want to hear about how we're going to attack the challenges facing middle class families each and every day  you want to hear about the issues that matter in your lives  you want to hear about how we're going to bring about the change that we desperately need for our country  that's what the american people want to hear  so let's talk about the issues that matter  in the debate this week  senator mccain felt the need to inform me that he's not president bush  and in fairness  i don't blame senator mccain for all of president bush's mistakes  after all  he's only voted with george bush   percent of the time  but it is fair to say that over the course of three debates and twenty months  senator mccain still hasn't offered a single thing that he would do differently from george w  bush when it comes to the most important economic issues we face today  not one  he wants to keep giving tax cuts to corporations that ship your jobs overseas just like george bush  i want to give tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in america  he wants to give tax cuts to exxon mobil and big corporations and their ceos   cuts we just can't afford   just like george bush  i want to give a break to   percent of middle class americans   folks who need it and deserve it  i want to give tax breaks to the small businesses that create more than two thirds of our jobs  that's how we'll strengthen our country  that's how we'll grow our economy again  i know i'm not running against president bush  but i am running against his policies   the policies john mccain has supported  the policies john mccain would continue  because that's something we can't afford  and that is especially true when it comes to health care  senator mccain and i have real differences on this issue  senator mccain has been eager to share some details of his health care plan   but not all  like those ads for prescription drugs  you have to read the fine print to learn the full story  first  we found out that he wants to pay for his plan by taxing your health care benefits for the first time in history  just like george bush  that was bad enough  but the wall street journal recently reported that it's actually worse than we thought  it turns out  senator mccain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in medicare   billion worth    billion in medicare cuts to pay for an ill conceived health care plan  even as medicare already faces a looming shortfall  now  this should come as no surprise   it's entirely consistent with senator mccain's record during his   years in congress where  time and again  he's opposed medicare  in fact  senator mccain has voted against protecting medicare   times    times  he's failed to stand up for medicare  so what would senator mccain's cuts mean for medicare at a time when more and more americans are relying on it  it would mean a cut of more than   percent in medicare benefits next year  if you count on medicare  it would mean fewer places to get care  and less freedom to choose your own doctors  you'll pay more for your drugs  receive fewer services  and get lower quality care  i don't think that's right  when you've worked hard your whole life  and paid into the system  and done everything right  you shouldn't have the carpet pulled out from under you when you least expect it and can least afford it  health care shouldn't be some kind of either or tradeoff where our seniors get left out in the cold  i think every single american has a right to affordable accessible health care  we can strengthen medicare by eliminating wasteful subsidies to big hmos in medicare  and making sure seniors can access home based care  and letting medicare negotiate with drug companies for better prices  that's the kind of change we need  so in the end  senator mccain can keep trying to attack me and distract you   but it's not going to work  not this time   not now  because while john mccain thinks this campaign is all about me   the truth is  this campaign is about you  your jobs  your health care  your retirement  your children's future  that's what this election is about  that's what i'm fighting for  because i can take   more weeks of these attacks from john mccain  but the american people can't take four more years of the same failed policies and the same divisive politics  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  it is time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put wall street before main street but ended up hurting both  we need policies that grow our economy from the bottom up  so that every american  everywhere  has the chance to get ahead  not just the person who owns the factory  but the men and women who work on its floor  because if we've learned anything from this economic crisis  it's that we're all connected  we're all in this together  and we will rise or fall as one nation   as one people  the rescue plan that passed the congress was a necessary first step to easing this credit crisis  it's also important that we continue to work with governments around the globe to confront what is truly a global crisis  but now we need a rescue plan for the middle class  if we're going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up  it has to start on main street   not just the big banks on wall street  that's why i've outlined several steps that we have to take right now to help folks who are struggling  first  we've got to act now to create good paying jobs  we've already lost three quarters of a million jobs this year  and some experts say unemployment may rise to   by the end of next year  that's why i've proposed a new american jobs tax credit for each new employee that companies hire here in the united states over the next two years  that's how we'll create good  new jobs here in virginia and all across america  second  we need to help small businesses get back on their feet  to fuel the real engine of job creation in this country  i'll eliminate all capital gains taxes on investments in small businesses and start up companies  and provide an additional tax incentive through next year to encourage new small business investment  and we'll also make sure that small businesses can access the immediate loans they need to pay their workers and finance their inventory  third  we need to provide relief for homeowners who are watching their home values decline while property taxes go up  the treasury must use the authority it's been granted and move aggressively to help people avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes  we don't need a new law or a new   billion giveaway to banks like senator mccain has proposed  we just need to act quickly and decisively  for those responsible homeowners in danger of losing their homes  i've proposed a three month moratorium on foreclosures so that we give people the breathing room they need to get back on their feet  finally  we've got to help states and local governments that have been squeezed  today  twenty one states are facing budget short falls   including virginia   and they might be forced to cut services or raise taxes  which is the last thing we need when so many families are struggling  that's why i'm going to create a   billion fund to help states and local governments pay for health care and education  police and firefighters  without having to raise your taxes  and we'll save one million jobs by creating a jobs and growth fund that will help states and local communities move forward with projects to rebuild and repair our roads  our bridges  and our schools  these are the steps that we must take   right now   to start getting our economy back on track  but we also need a new set of priorities  bottom up growth depends on a tax code that doesn't just work for the folks at the top  you've heard a lot about taxes in this campaign  well  here's the truth   my opponent and i are both offering tax cuts  the difference is  he wants to double down on president bush's tax policies by giving   billion in tax cuts to the biggest corporations in america  and giving the average fortune   ceo a   tax cut  but he would give nothing at all to over   million americans  i have a different set of priorities  i'll give a middle class tax cut to   of all workers  and if you make less than   a year   which includes   percent of small business owners   you won't see your taxes increase one single dime  not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  if i am president  i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new  green jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel efficient cars  jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from middle east dictators  i'll also put two million more americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads  schools  and bridges   because it is time to build an american infrastructure for the  st century  and if people ask how we're going to pay for this  you tell them that if we can spend   billion a month in iraq  we can spend some money to rebuild america  if i am president  i will finally fix our broken health care system  this issue is personal for me  my mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of   and i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed  fighting with her insurance company because they claimed that her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  if i am president  i will make sure those insurance companies can never do that again  my health care plan will make sure insurance companies can't discriminate against those who are sick and need care most  if you have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  if you don't have health insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  and we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families  businesses  and the entire economy  that's the change we need  and we'll give every child  everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker  anywhere in the world  i will not allow countries to out teach us today so they can out compete us tomorrow  it is time to provide every american with a world class education  that means investing in early childhood education  that means recruiting an army of new teachers  and paying them better  and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability  and it means making a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  senator mccain's top economic advisor actually said the other day that they have no plan to invest in college affordability because we can't have a giveaway to every special interest  well i don't think the young people of america are a special interest   they are the future of this country  that's why i'll make this deal with you  if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  no ifs  ands or buts  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together  we will move this country forward  finally  i will take on the corruption in washington and on wall street to make sure a crisis like this can never  ever happen again  i'll put in place the common sense regulations and rules of the road i've been calling for since march   rules that will keep our market free  fair  and honest  rules that will restore accountability and responsibility in our corporate boardrooms  and just as we demand accountability on wall street  i will also demand it in washington  that's why i'm not going to stand here and simply tell you what i'm going to spend  i'm going to tell you how we're going to save when i am president  i'll do what you do in your own family budgets and make sure we're spending money wisely  i will go through the entire federal budget  page by page  line by line  and eliminate programs that don't work and aren't needed  we'll start by ending a war in iraq that's cost us nearly a trillion dollars  and we'll save billions more by cutting waste  improving management  and strengthening oversight  these are the changes and reforms we need  a new era of responsibility and accountability on wall street and in washington  common sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again  investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the  st century  bottom up growth that gives every american a fair shot at the american dream  and above all confidence   confidence in america  confidence in our economy  and confidence in ourselves  i won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever  we are all in this together  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  this is one of those moments  i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics  i understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what's been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history  i ask you to believe   to believe in yourselves  in each other  and in the future we can build together  together  we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  or pay their bills at the end of the month  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves  we are   days away from changing this country    days  but for those who are getting a little cocky  i've got two words for you  new hampshire  that's where i learned that you can't let up or pay too much attention to the polls  we've got to keep making our case for change  we've got to keep fighting for every vote  we've got to keep running through that finish line  this election is too important to take anything for granted  the future that you and i seek for our children is too important to let up now  the time for change has come  we can do this  americans have done this before  some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  together  we cannot fail  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will win virginia  we will win this election  and then you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "nevada  in just   days  you'll have the chance to elect your next president  and you'll have the chance to bring the change we need to washington  that's the good news  but we're going to have to work  and struggle  and fight for every single one of those   days to move our country in a new direction  we cannot let up  and we won't  because one thing we know is that change never comes without a fight  in the final days of campaigns  the say anything  do anything politics too often takes over  we've seen it before  and we're seeing it again today  the ugly phone calls  the misleading mail and tv ads  the careless  outrageous comments  all aimed at keeping us from working together  all aimed at stopping change  well  this isn't what we need right now  the american people don't want to hear politicians attack each other   you want to hear about how we're going to attack the challenges facing middle class families each and every day  so what we need now is honest leadership and real change  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  this is a moment of great uncertainty for america  the economic crisis we face is the worst since the great depression  businesses large and small are finding it impossible to get loans  which means they can't buy new equipment  or hire new workers  or even make payroll for the workers they have  we've lost more than   jobs this year   and unemployment here in nevada is up   this year  wages are lower than they've been in a decade  at a time when the cost of health care and college have never been higher  it's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage  or fill up your gas tank  or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month  at this rate  the question isn't just  are you better off than you were four years ago  it's  are you better off than you were four weeks ago  so what we need right now is a real debate about how to fix our economy and help middle class families  but that's not what we're getting from the other side  a couple of weeks ago  my opponent's campaign said that  if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  so they said they'd be focusing on attacking me instead  and that's one campaign promise they've actually kept  senator mccain has been throwing everything he's got at us  hoping something will stick  he's even called me a socialist for suggesting that we focus on tax cuts  not for corporations and the wealthy  but for the middle class  then  the other day  he took it to a whole new level  he said that i was like george w  bush  you can't make this stuff up  folks  in what may be the strangest twist of all  senator mccain said that i would somehow continue the bush economic policies   and that he  john mccain  would change them  he actually denounced the president for letting things   and i quote    get completely out of hand  that's right  john mccain has been really angry about george bush's economic policies   except during the primaries  when he said we've made  great progress economically  under george bush  or just last month  when he said that the  fundamentals of our economy are strong  in fact  john mccain is so opposed to george bush's policies  that he voted with him   percent of the time for the past eight years  that's right  he decided to really stick it to him     percent of the time  well  let's be clear  john mccain attacking george bush for his out of hand economic policy is like dick cheney attacking george bush for his go it alone foreign policy  fortunately  president bush doesn't seem to be at all offended   because yesterday  he cast his vote   early   for senator mccain  and that's no surprise  because when it comes to the policies that matter for middle class families  there's not an inch of daylight between george bush and john mccain  like george bush  john mccain wants to keep giving tax breaks to oil companies and ceos and companies that ship our jobs overseas  it's the same  failed  wall street first main street last economic policy   and we're going to change it  like george bush  john mccain wants to tax your health care benefits for the first time in history  and let insurance companies keep discriminating against people who need health care the most  it's the same  failed  insurance company first your family last health care policy   and we're going to change it  like george bush  john mccain wants to privatize social security   and leave it to the whims of the market  like george bush  john mccain ignored this housing crisis until it was too late   and then proposed a   billion bailout for wall street banks that does hardly anything to help people stay in their homes  like george bush  he wants less government regulation of business   he said it again just yesterday  the twenty first time he's called for less regulation just this year  now none of us want to see unnecessary burdens on business  but after what we've seen on wall street  isn't it obvious by now that we need some commonsense rules of the road to protect consumers and our economy  i think we've had enough of the bush mccain economics  i can take ten more days of john mccain's attacks  but the american people can't take four more years of the same failed policies and the same failed politics  we're not going to let george bush pass the torch to john mccain  it's time for change  i know these are difficult times  i know folks are worried  but i believe that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis because i believe in this country  because i believe in you  i believe in the american people  we are the united states of america  we are a nation that's faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we have risen to meet these challenges   not as democrats  not as republicans  but as americans  with resolve  with confidence  with that fundamental belief that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  that's who we are  and that's the country we need to be right now  but nevada  i know this  it will take a new direction  it will take new leadership in washington  it's time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put wall street before main street but ended up hurting both  we need policies that grow our economy from the bottom up  so that every american  everywhere  has the chance to get ahead  not just the person who owns the factory  but the men and women who work on its floor  not just the ceo  but the secretary and the janitor  because if we've learned anything from this economic crisis  it's that we're all connected  we're all in this together  and we will rise or fall as one nation   as one people  the rescue plan that passed the congress was a necessary first step to easing this credit crisis  but if we're going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up  we need an immediate rescue plan for the middle class   and that's what i will do as president of the united states  i've proposed a new american jobs tax credit for each new employee that companies hire here in the united states over the next two years  i'll stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and invest in companies that create good jobs right here in nevada  i'll help small businesses get back on their feet by eliminating capital gains taxes and giving them emergency loans to keep their doors open and hire workers  and i will create a jobs and growth fund to help states and local governments save one million jobs and pay for health care and education without having to raise your taxes  i'll also act quickly to help people stay in their homes  something that's especially critical here in nevada where foreclosure rates are five times the national average  i'll help responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages on affordable terms  and put in place a three month moratorium on foreclosures to give folks the breathing room they need to get back on their feet  and i won't let banks and lenders off the hook when it was their greed and irresponsibility that got us into this mess  we should not be bailing out wall street   we should be restoring opportunity on main street  these are the steps that we must take   right now   to start getting our economy back on track  but we also need a new set of priorities to grow our economy and create jobs over the long term  it starts with tax relief  there's been a lot of talk about taxes in this campaign  and the truth is  my opponent and i are both proposing tax cuts  the difference is  he wants to give a   tax cut to the average fortune   ceo  i want to put a middle class tax cut in the pockets of   of workers and their families  my opponent doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  it's true that i want to roll back the bush tax cuts on the wealthiest americans and go back to the rate they paid under bill clinton  john mccain calls that socialism  what he forgets is that just a few years ago  he himself said those bush tax cuts were irresponsible  he said he couldn't  in good conscience  support a tax cut where the benefits went to the wealthy at the expense of  middle class americans who most need tax relief  well  he was right then  and i am right now  so let me be crystal clear  if you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year   which includes   of small business owners   you won't see your taxes increase one single dime  not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  that is my commitment to you  for the last eight years  we have tried it john mccain's way  we have tried it george bush's way  we've given more and more to those with the most and hoped that prosperity would trickle down to everyone else  and guess what  it didn't  so it's time to try something new  it's time to grow this economy by investing in the middle class again  if i am president  i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new  green jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel efficient cars  jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from middle east dictators  i'll also put two million more americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads  schools  and bridges   because it is time to build an american infrastructure for the  st century  and if people ask how we're going to pay for this  you tell them that if we can spend   billion a month in iraq  we can spend some money to rebuild america  if i am president  i will finally fix the problems in our health care system that we've been talking about for too long  this issue is personal for me  my mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of   and i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed  fighting with her insurance company because they claimed that her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  if i am president  i will make sure those insurance companies can never do that again  my health care plan will make sure insurance companies can't discriminate against those who are sick and need care most  if you have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  if you don't have health insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  and we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families  businesses  and the entire economy  that's the change we need  and if i'm president  we'll give every child  everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker  anywhere in the world  i will not allow countries to out teach us today so they can out compete us tomorrow  it is time to provide every american with a world class education  that means investing in early childhood education  that means recruiting an army of new teachers  and paying them better  and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability  and it means making a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  my opponent's top economic advisor actually said that they have no plan to invest in college affordability because we can't have a giveaway to every special interest  well i don't think the young people of america are a special interest   they are the future of this country  that's why i'll make this deal with you  if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  no ifs  ands or buts  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together  we will move this country forward  now  make no mistake  the change we need won't come easy or without cost  we will all need to tighten our belts  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever  we are all in this together  at a defining moment like this  we don't have the luxury of relying on the same political games and the same political tactics that are used every election to divide us from one another and make us afraid of one another  with the challenges and crises we face right now  we cannot afford to divide this country by class or region  by who we are or what policies we support  there are no real or fake parts of this country  we are not separated by the pro america and anti america parts of this nation   we all love this country  no matter where we live or where we come from  there are patriots who supported this war in iraq and patriots who opposed it  patriots who believe in democratic policies and those who believe in republican policies  the men and women from nevada and all across america who serve on our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents  but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag  they have not served a red america or a blue america   they have served the united states of america  we have always been at our best when we've had leadership that called us to look past our differences and come together as one nation  as one people  leadership that rallied this entire country to a common purpose   to a higher purpose  and i am running for president of the united states of america because that is the country we need to be right now  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed the same divisions and fear tactics and our own petty differences to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  this is one of those moments  i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics  i understand

vote early right here  and right now  to find out how  just go to voteforchange com  and if you stand with me in ten days  i promise you   we will win nevada  we will win this election  and then you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "]]
