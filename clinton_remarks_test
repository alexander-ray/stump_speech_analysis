[["clinton", " b senator clinton b  hi  everyone  and welcome to our first online web chat  we've got a lot to talk about tonight  but first i want to thank you for the great response we've been getting since we started the campaign on saturday  you know  it's amazing how new technology can bring so many of us together  we've already got a lot of questions to answer  so let's get started  i probably should dispose of the most important question  this is really for my brothers  they are fanatic chicago bears fans  so go bears  what can i say  they said  if you're going to talk to anybody  you gotta well root them on  i want you to meet crystal patterson  crystal is going to be our campaign blogger  tonight she is going to be letting me know your questions  so  let the conversation begin  crystal  what is the first question   b crystal patterson b  the first question is from barbara in massachusetts  what can i say to people who say this country isn't ready for a woman president   b senator clinton b  well  barbara  i hope you'll tell them  number one  we won't know until we try  every time we've broken any barriers  that's always required people to take a bit of a leap of faith because it hasn't baseball done before  but i am fully confident that there are many women in our country who are equipped and ready to lead just as has happened in other countries around the world  but i'm doing this because i believe i would be the best candidate and the best president  i'm not looking for people who say  well  i'm going to vote for her just because she's a woman  but i do think it's important that we try to demonstrate that women are fully capable of serving at the highest level in our government  and obviously  i'm going to be asking people to give me the honor of that   b crystal patterson b  our next question is from carolyn in new york  carolyn asks  where do you stand on the iraq war  knowing what you know today  do you regret your vote of endorsement to go into iraq in the first place  i would love to support you  but these issues are very important to me and many others   b senator clinton b  well  they're very important to me as well  there's nothing more important  and you know  ever since i became a senator from new york  your state and mine  i have worried about   and terrorism and afghanistan and iraq  i have said many times that  if we had known then  when the president came to the congress to ask for authority to pursue what he said would be an effort to contain saddam hussein and put inspectors in to make sure that he didn't have weapons of mass destruction  if we had known everything that we now know  the president would never have asked for such authority  and the congress would never have voted to give it to him  and i certainly would not have voted to do so  but all these years later  we are faced with a very dangerous situation  and what i've tried to focus on  starting  you know  shortly after the invasion  when i began pointing out the problem saw and raising questions about the policy that was being pursued from my position on the armed armed services committee  we have to make better decisions now than this president was made in the past  that's why i went again  my third trip to afghanistan and iraq last weekend  and i tried to make my own assessment  and when i returned  i reaffirmed my opposition to the president's strategy of escalation  putting march american troops into baghdad  into iraq  instead  i think we should cap the number of troops  and we should begin to put real conditions on the iraqi government  i've said  look  i don't want to cut money for american troops  i've been to too many events and places like our military hospital in germany  where i stopped on the way back  where i met with our wounded servicemen and women  i don't want to do anything that in any way undercuts their ability to protect themselves and to do what they need to do in the combat arenas where they are being placed  but i do think we should threaten to cut the funding for the iraqi army and the iraqi police force and the security for the iraqi leaders  which we pay for  unless they make some of the decisions that we've been expecting them to make for a number of years  i don't understand why this president has given them such a blank check  and i think we need to make clear there is no open ended commitment  we need a phased redeployment of our troops  we need to try to bring them home as safely and as soon as it is possible  but let me add that america does have some remaining very vital security interests  the al qaeda in iraq  they weren't there before  they are there now  they pose a threat not only to our troops in iraq but to our friends in the region and even to us here at home  we have to make sure we do everything we can to try to prevent them from using their horrendous terrorist tactics against americans and against other innocent people  we also need to try to prevent iran from expanding its influence in iraq and in the region  and prevent its continuing effort to obtain a nuclear weapon which would be so dangerous not only to the region but also to israel and our country and really to the stability of the world  so  yes  i would certainly  you know  wish that we didn't have the situation we face now  but i'm going to continue to do what i can to try to be as responsible as possible to get our troops home but also to deal with the dangers that have been unleashed there   b crystal patterson b  our next question is from kim in winston salem  north carolina  senator clinton  how does new orleans rank on your list of priorities  and what are your plans for bringing new orleans and the gulf coast back   b senator clinton b  it ranks very high  i spent many years having a wonderful life in arkansas  and my husband and i used to go to new orleans  and so i've walked those streets  i have had many friends who have lived and worked in new orleans  when i went down to visit after the horrors of katrina and rita  i was just heartbroken to see the devastation  i don't believe that this president and our government have responded as i would want them to  they have not put in the effort  the money  the attention  and focus that the people in new orleans and in the surrounding parishes and along the gulf coast deserve  so this is a high priority for me  you know  it's really unimaginable that our country would turn its back on the people who suffered so much  these are our fellow americans  many of them don't feel they can even go back home  and i meet people all the time who they themselves and their families are still dislocated  it's tragic that we had such a poorly organized half hearted response continue to this day to fail the people in the gulf coast area  so i'm going to do everything i can  first from my position as senator  and then  i hope  as your president  to try to make good to the people who have unfortunately been so disappointed and let down   b crystal patterson b  our next question is from matty in new york  matty says  i am a  year old class president from armonk  new york  i have an interest in politics and one day aspire to be president  my question is what made you so inspirational  and why do you believe you should be president   b senator clinton b  matty  you live very near where bill and i live in chappaqua  you're just right up the road  there's no guide book for someone who wants to go into political life  i didn't think i'd ever personally run for office  but i'd always worked in campaigns and believe strongly in doing my part to help our democracy work  i guess my advice would be do what you love  do what really makes you happy  for me  when i was growing up  i wanted to help people  i particularly wanted to help children when i was in college and then in law school  i spent a lot of time studying about the best ways to help kids  and then i did  you know  work when i was in law school with children who were abused and neglected and tried to think of ways that i could be of help  and i worked for the children's defense fund  you know  through that  i really was exposed to a lot of the problems that i frankly didn't see when i was growing up  i had a very nice middle class upbringing in a suburb of chicago  and i think  if you can get out and learn more about the world and volunteer to help people  i did that through my church when i was growing up  and any way that you can expand your horizons because every one of us is somewhat limited by the family we're born into and the experiences we have and where we go to school  and i think today  more than ever  we need young people like yourself who's really going to learn about the world and understand what you can do to make a contribution  and i would also just really recommend just study what you're interested in  learn as much as you can  and volunteer in campaigns  you know  you're in armonk  i hope you'll volunteer in my campaign because you get to see firsthand how our system works  i wish you a lot of luck with your life as you go forward  and just keep dreaming big dreams because we need young people who care a lot about what's going to happen in the future   b crystal patterson b  our next question is from debra in upper sandusky  ohio  i am a  year old single female  i've been a hair dresser for   years  i cannot afford to think about paying any kind of health coverage  what would you do as president about this serious problem   b senator clinton b  debra  i hear about that from so many people  particularly people like yourself who are self employed  working for small employers who don't offer health insurance  i remain committed to providing quality affordable health care for every american  now  some people might say  well  senator  didn't you try that before  you know  back in   and   and i did  i worked at my husband's request to try to see if we could do what was necessary to create a system that everybody could be part of  and we were not successful  and we made a bunch of mistakes  and i've learned from all of that  and i have the scars to show what we went through  and back then  i'm not sure that enough people really accepted the fact that what we'd always had was just no longer going to be successful in a new global economy where our businesses are competing with companies and countries that don't have to provide health insurance or where everybody has to offer it so that  you know  everybody's in it together  so i'm determined to work toward this  but what i've been encouraged about  debra  is that for the first time in the last several months  people are really focused on this  we've got businesses talking with labor unions  talking  you know  with community people  talking with doctors and nurses and hospitals  and everybody's coming together  all levels of business  all levels of government  and so i'm very encouraged that we're going to do what americans do best when we finally roll up our sleeves and say  look  we've got a problem  it's a problem of cost because  as you say  it's too expensive  it's a problem of competition because we are losing jobs in america  because we haven't figured out how to make quality health care affordable and available to everyone  and it's also a question of will  you know  political will  are we going to roll up our sleeves and do this  and i think we will  so i'm sure going to be campaigning about it around the country  i'm going to be asking people in these conversations to give me their ideas  what they think would work  and i sure hope that  you know  you're going to be able to have affordable health care  one of my ideas that specifically would affect someone in your age category  which is my age category  is to let people who don't have insurance between   and   buy into medicare  that's one idea that we've had floated around that we could look at  or buy into the federal employee health benefits plan  which is what takes care of senators like me  so a lot of good ideas  but i'm determined that we're going to come up with a better system so that i don't have to hear the stories that i hear about people who are really left out  bankrupted  denied medical care when they need it most   b crystal patterson b  timothy from honolulu says   we've always admired the great job bill and you did in shielding chelsea from life in a fish bowl  and in the process raising her to be such an intelligent and well poised lady  we were wondering  now that she's an adult accomplished in her own right  do you expect she'll be taking a more active and visible role in your upcoming campaigns than she has in previous campaigns   b senator clinton b  one of the things about raising an independent son or daughter  in my case  is you want them to do what's right for them  and that will be up to her  what i appreciate is the fact that being in public life has a lot of great benefits and privileges  but the families of people in public life have  you know  unfortunately been put in that fish bowl  as you say  and what i've tried to do and what i admire about other people  including our president currently in the white house and others  is  you know  we shouldn't be exposing our children and other relatives  that's not  in my view  part of the political process that we really need to do  so i appreciate what you said  and  obviously  i turn to her for advice and support in every way  and i will continue to do so   b crystal patterson b  michael from new rochelle  new york  asks   what are you going to do to specifically battle terrorism and keep the united states safe   b senator clinton b  new rochelle is another neighbor of mine  we're both outside of new york city  as you know living in new rochelle  we went through such a horrible time after   every one of us in the greater new york area knew somebody who was affected  that gives us perhaps a keener awareness of the dangers we face  sometimes it can seem like   was a long time ago or a very long way away  when i travel around the country and talk to people who weren't there  weren't affected  but just this morning  i was at ground zero with victims who had been afflicted by the toxic dust that was released because of the collapse of the world trade center buildings  we have people dying  we have people unable to breathe  we have a retired nypd officer fighting for his life in one of our hospitals right now  his son is going to be my guest at the state of the union tomorrow night  so   and the threat of terrorism is never very far away from my mind  and i intend to do everything i can for us to remain vigilant and prepared  we've made some progress in the last year since   but not nearly enough  our system is not as focused on the threats we face as i would like it to be  and i want to continue to advocate for more resources and better funding and more personnel to protect our borders  our ports  our mass transit systems  we've done a good job on passenger aircraft but not as good a job on all of the materials  the freight that is shipped by air  we need to be vigilant about who's coming in and out of our country  we try to stop terrorism wherever we can beyond our borders by having better cooperation with people around the world  so this is a primary goal of mine  to make sure that we are as well prepared as possible  i can't sit here tonight and tell you that there will never be another attack although i pray there will not be  but we want to know that we've done everything we can to prevent that from ever happening to anyone again  the scars of   and the lives of the people that i serve and represent in new york are still present every single day  and it remains  you know  my primary obligation to make sure that we take care of those who were affected and their families and do everything i can to prevent that from happening anywhere in our country again   b crystal patterson b  linda from pensacola  florida  asks   do you plan to end our dependence on foreign oil   b senator clinton b  linda  i do  it's probably longer and more wonkish than i can tell you in a brief web chat  but just briefly  let me say that i've put on my web site a lot of the legislation that i've championed and my plans for how we decrease our dependence on foreign oil  you know  obviously  this is a security issue as well as a jobs issue  securitywise  we know that  if we don't move away from our dependence on foreign oil  we are literally over the barrel  from people who do not wish us well and not just in the middle east and not just places like iran  but venezuela  and we're also at the mercy of very unstable regimes than other parts of the world  so i don't think there's a higher security priority  and the previous question about terrorism goes hand in hand because we can better deal with the terrorist threats we face if we are not funding them through all kinds of means where they get money that literally comes out of our pocket because we are so dependent upon the natural resource that they have in abundance  so we also  though  need to look at this as a jobs issue  we need to create new and good paying jobs in america  and alternative energy  what i like to call smart energy  home grown energy  would be a tremendous way of giving a lot of our people a better future  helping them to have a more secure foothold in this very competitive global economy  so i think we've got to do more to look for alternatives  i support all kinds of ethanol  i support looking at the solar and geo thermal and certainly trying to do more on hydrogen  which are longer term goals  i think we have to do more on conservation and energy efficiency  i'm really impressed with what california has done over   years  because they have imposed conservation and energy efficiency standards  they have kept flat their energy use  and the rest of the country has just  unfortunately  continued to use more and more energy  we've got to do something to make our transportation system more fuel efficient  and although there are some who think it's  you know  a difficult problem  i would like to see us approach the question of how we can use the great coal reserves we have without polluting the environment and adding to global change  i've asked to take away the subsidies from big oil and put it into a strategic energy fund that would be used comparable to what he did with the manhattan project  responding to sputnik  the apollo project  using the energy fund with a windfall tax on the oil companies taking away their subsidies  to expedite the creative genius of americans  and i was up at a plant of ge's  their research facility  which is in upstate new york  and i saw what we can do if we use our imagination and our know how  and i would also very much like to see us form an agency within our government that put all of this on a fast track  that went out to our universities  our colleges  our garages where creative people are thinking about how to make solar and wind and everything else much more commercially applicable  let's put this on a fast track  there's no reason we can't do it  but the federal government has to make some investments in order for it to happen   b crystal patterson b  jean from new jersey has a question  on a lighter note  what's your favorite movie   b senator clinton b  my favorite movie  i've had favorite movies at different stages in my life  when i was very much younger  the wizard of oz was my favorite movie  i just loved imagining myself being there with dorothy and being part of that great adventure that she had  probably when i was in college and law school  casablanca  i watched it i don't know how many times  it always was so much fun  by the time we watched it over and over again  we were actually reciting the dialogue  and i suppose in the last years  out of africa  i love meryl streep and robert red ford  those are three of my favorite movies   b crystal patterson b  rachel in austin  texas  asks  our relations with the international community have deteriorated over the last several years  what will you do to mend our relationships with the other countries   b senator clinton b  i think this is the most important task the next president will face  and i intend to tackle it head on  i have been fortunate over the last     years to travel widely representing our country  to know many of the leaders that are currently running their countries and those who are coming in to power  we have to send a clear message that the united states wants to lead the world  but we want to do it through cooperation  building alliances  making more friends than enemies  we cannot kill  occupy  jail all of the bad guys who wish us ill  but we sure can surround them  we can deter them  we can defeat them  if we have people rooting for us  and what's happened in the last six years tragically  because the world was with us after   they were there with us  they wished us well  they wanted to be part of the fight against the terrorists  and we have so squandered that good will  and we've got to rebuild it  and that means starting at the top with a president who will send a message to the rest of the world that we want to work together  we believe in negotiations  and we want to have diplomatic efforts  i don't understand why our current president won't talk to people that he considers bad  i mean  look  there are a lot of bad actors in the world  but i think it's a sign of strength  not weakness  to engage in a process with these people because  frankly  you can learn something  you know  one of the first rules of warfare is know your enemy  and we're flying blind because we won't sit down and try to figure out what these people really want  who's calling the shots  how we can better deter them  all during the cold war  republican and democratic presidents talked to the leaders in the soviet union  after richard nixon's break through  we talked to the leaders in china  now it's as though we are over in one point of the world and looking out and pointing fingers and making judgments  so we don't have the good will  and we are not being smart about how we can better solve our problems  so i agree that we've got to have a different approach  and i intend to do that not only through this campaign by talking about it and putting up ideas that i think would make a difference  but as president  going out there and making it clear that we want to solve problems together  one last point about this because literally i could talk for the rest of this web chat  you know  when president bush pulled out of kyoto  i thought that was a mistake  but an even bigger mistake was he refused to go into any other process  if you don't like what was negotiated at kyoto  well  don't turn your back and pretend that global climate change isn't real because it is  and it is affecting our climate  and it is going to have an increasingly big impact on how people live  so come up with a different process  but don't walk away from the problem  just because you don't deal with the problem doesn't make the problem go away  so on that and on so many issues  we need to get back into a dialogue with the rest of the world   b crystal patterson b  alexis from anondale  virginia  asks   what will you do to insure that middle class americans can afford a college education   b senator clinton b  you know  i hear about this problem all the time  college is increasingly expensive  everybody knows that  and it's very hard  with the cost of everything else going up  for most middle class families to afford to save and pay for college  you know  that means that  number one  a lot of kids don't go who would be college material because they can't afford to start  a lot of other kids don't finish because they get there and they can't afford to complete their education  and thirdly  a lot of kids go and tough it out  often working  you know  jobs  sometimes more than one job  and they get out  and they have a lot of debt  which really hangs over them  making it very difficult for them to get started with their own lives and families  so we've got to get the cost of college down  we need much more in the way of college aid  we also need to get back to need based aid because a lot of kids who are really good prospects for college  they may not be the a student  but they're the solid b student  or they're the really hard working c student  and now we've cut so much of the aid that used to be based on need and shift it over to merit that a lot of these kids aren't having a chance  and i don't think it's smart or fair  we also need to get the cost of college loans down  cut the interest rates  we're trying to do that in the congress now  but i believe this is a big problem because  if you actually look at the numbers  we haven't done that much to increase the percentage of our kids who actually graduate from college  and in a competitive global economy like the one we face today  we need to get our best educated kids out there competing  college  you know  you don't have to go to college to be a good person or to get a good job  but increasingly a lot of the jobs are really dependent upon additional education  so i'm hoping that we'll get the costs down and we'll enable many more people to start and to finish without that huge debt load  which i would like to see much more forgiveness to if we could get kids to graduate and then go into public service jobs  take some of the jobs that we really need to have filled  we should be forgiving their debt as well   b crystal patterson b  our final question tonight is from nancy in wisconsin  nancy says   i'm one of the baby boomers who now looks at retirement as an impossible dream  i've worked hard all my life  and i'm discouraged  what can you tell me and others like me that will give us some hope   b senator clinton b  well  nancy  i understand the discouragement because the cost of living has gone up  a lot of the pensions that used to be guaranteed for people are no longer available  a lot of workers have lost their pensions because of decisions made in the corporate boardrooms  or companies have gone bankrupt and just shed all of their responsibilities to hard working employees like yourself  social security is there  it's an absolutely critical part of anyone's planning for retirement  and i will do everything i can to make sure it's protected and that it will be available to you and to others  but we've got to come up with some new ways of helping you save for retirement and making sure that you're not going to be left hanging  either by your employer or by your government through social security  so i'm looking at some ideas about how to help you and other people who are hard working like you make investments in accounts that will be safe and will be on top of social security  that will be there when you need it  when you're ready for retirement  this is a huge issue because pension security  retirement security is something that is really part of the basic bargain that i believe we should have between our government and our people  and it's something i'm going to be focused on during this campaign   b crystal patterson b  great  well  that's it for tonight  thank you  senator  we'll see you tomorrow night   b senator clinton b  see you tomorrow night    same place  same time  and i want to thank everyone who logged on tonight to watch and everyone who submitted a question  i hope you've learned a little bit more about what i'm believing and trying to do and really helped this conversation about our country get started  iraq  energy  health care  we've covered a lot of ground  and these are all concerns that are very important to me  so please log back on tomorrow night at   p m  eastern so we can keep this conversation going  send me more questions  ask me anything you'd like  i want everyone to be part of the discussion because we need everyone to be part of the solution  so thank you so much  and i hope see you tomorrow "], ["clinton", "well  thank you very  very  much  i am delighted to be back at gw and i want to thank president trachtenberg for his kind introduction  but he and his wife francine have been leading advocates on behalf of higher education and so many other issues for as long as i've known them  and that goes back many years  and as joel said  we shared the experience of our children in high school  and that was indeed an experience we both survived  so we're grateful to tell the tale  i want to thank dr  williams  and  of course  dr  becker  i want also to recognize russ ramsey  the chair of the board  dr  scott  dean of the medical school and the ceo of gw medical faculty associates  stephen badger  it is an honor to be back at gw in order to talk about one of the most important issues facing the health care community  and of course  our country  as i travel around america  i have talked with people from all walks of life about the challenges that our country is facing  from ending the war in iraq to ending our dependence on foreign oil   from improving our education system to reducing our deficit  and no matter where i go or with whom i talk   whether it's small business owners or ceos  doctors or nurses or patients   i hear growing concern about the crisis in our health care system  exploding costs  declining coverage and shortcoming in care and prevention  now  i've tangled with this issue before   and i've got the scars to show for it  but i learned some valuable lessons from that experience  one is that we can't achieve reform without the participation and commitment of health care providers  employers  employees and other citizens who pay for  depend upon  and actually deliver health care services  i think we finally have a recognition that everyone sees there is an economic imperative to rein in costs  there is a moral imperative to extend coverage to all americans  and  there is a practical necessity to promote wellness and prevent illness wherever possible  i plan to put those lessons to work to ensure every single american has quality  affordable health coverage  there are three parts to my approach  first  lowering costs for everyone  second  improving quality for everyone  third  insuring everyone  today  i will focus on the challenge of lowering costs  health care costs are spiraling out of control  premiums have almost doubled since     increasing four times faster than average wages  every day  parents choose between paying the premium for themselves or their children  small businesses wonder how they will stay afloat when their health care costs eat up their profits year after year  ceos of major american companies worry about how they will succeed in the global economy when they're competing with foreign companies that spend significantly less on health care  we spend   percent of our gross domestic product     trillion   on health care  and by   health costs are scheduled to exceed   trillion  or almost   of gdp  that means that within less than   years    cents out of every dollar produced in america will be spent on healthcare  no other country spends more than   a difference of more than   billion  all other wealthy countries spend even less  we spend   per patient  the next highest spending country  switzerland  spends   on patients  yet  they cover every single one of their citizens and have an average life expectancy that is three years longer than ours  now  how have our costs spiraled out of control like this  well  about   of the rise in health care spending is linked to the doubling of obesity among adults over the past   years  in other words  if our obesity levels had remained at   levels  we would be spending   less on health care today   a savings of   billion  about two thirds of the rise in health care spending is associated with a rise in the prevalence of treatable disease   like diabetes  asthma and heart disease    of all health care spending   roughly   trillion   is associated with the   to   percent of patients who have multiple chronic illnesses and require ongoing medical management over a period of years  or even decades  and   of the total health care budget is spent on end of life care  our administrative costs are by far the highest in the world  today more than one in four health care dollars goes to administration    of private insurance plans' administrative costs are dedicated to underwriting health risks  sales  and marketing  every man  woman and child in america spends   on health care administration  nearly six times as much as other countries  according to a recent report by mckinsey  the united states spends   billion more than other countries on excessive administrative costs that have nothing to do with delivering good health care  too much of the money we spend is wasted on care that doesn't improve health  a study in santa barbara  california found that one out of every five lab tests and x rays were conducted solely because previous test results were unavailable  a recent study reported in the atlantic monthly found that for two thirds of the patients who received a   surgery to prevent strokes  there was no compelling evidence that the surgery actually worked  at the same time  in situations where the benefits of intervention are clear  many patients still don't receive the care they need  a recent study in the new england journal of medicine found that  overall  americans get needed care only   percent of the time  if we spend so much  why does the world health organization rank the united states  st in life expectancy and  th in child mortality   worse than cuba and croatia  our health care system is plagued with under use  overuse and misuse  it is  simply put  broken  as president  i will make it my mission to fix it  starting by helping the   million people with public or private insurance who face skyrocketing costs  inadequate care  and bureaucratic obstacles to coverage  today  i'm announcing a seven point plan to lower health care costs for all american and again to make our healthcare system  without doubt from any corner  the best in the world  building a national consensus around these cost savings is the first crucial step to cover all americans with quality  affordable healthcare  first  we're going to focus on prevention   on wellness  not just sickness  under my reforms  all americans will have access to comprehensive preventive care  which will save money in the long run  today  we pay doctors and hospitals to treat diseases and injuries  but not to help prevent them from occurring in the first place  only   percent of adults receive recommended colorectal screening  and roughly   percent of children do not receive recommended immunizations  in fact  our country spends only an estimated   to   percent of national health expenditures on preventive health care services and health promotion per year  that is about the same percentage we spent in the  s  for example we have many more adults and young people being diagnosed with type   diabetes  while  the costs of caring for them are increasing exponentially  many insurance companies won't pay for someone who's pre diabetic or who's been diagnosed with diabetes to go to a nutritionist to learn how to eat properly  to get preventive medicine or to go to a podiatrist to have their feet checked  but the companies will pay if you have to have your foot amputated  the insurance companies will actually tell you they don't want to pay for preventive health care because the patient might change insurance companies  and the original company won't get the benefits of the money they invested  but if a patient's doctor tells them that a foot needs to be amputated  well the company is kind of stuck with that  talk about a system that is upside down and backwards  we clearly need a new approach  we know we can save money if we give insurance companies incentives to cover preventive care and wellness services   and my plan will do exactly that  keeping people healthy today will not only keep our costs down in the future  but improve quality of life as well  we know that preventive care works  i could cite thousands of examples  but just consider the following  the incidence of diabetes was   percent lower among adults with elevated blood sugar were enrolled in a lifestyle intervention program than the control group that was only given drugs  among those aged   and older the reduction was   percent  and some of the research that was done leading to these outcomes was right here at gw  or look at what the private sector has tried to do  safeway has made a conscious decision to focus on prevention  it pays   of all appropriate preventive care services  and it offers a  hour hotline staffed by registered nurses  and provides services to help people manage chronic conditions and incentives designed to promote healthier lifestyles  again  the results speak for themselves  while average costs went up   across the country  safeway its health care costs will be flat  and they aren't the exception  motorola's wellness initiative showed savings of almost   per every dollar invested  under my plan  all insurers who are already participating in a federal health program like medicare or medicaid or the federal employee's health benefit plan will have to cover prevention as a condition of doing business with the federal government  insurers would encourage both individuals and providers to use prevention services by paying for benefits like cancer screenings and immunizations  my plan also pools and coordinates federal spending on prevention to help redeploy high priority preventive services  working in collaboration with the private sector  this initiative would pay for preventive care initiatives in schools  workplaces  supermarkets  churches  communities  it would fund and train new health prevention outreach workers  who understood the language  understood the culture of various constituencies around our country  now  we still have so many people  and i'm sure you see it in the hospital  who come in unable to speak english  often times bringing a child to interpret  and we're just not doing a good enough job in getting information broadly available to people who need it  now  of course  you can have the best insurance plan in the world  but if you don't take the medicine your doctor prescribes  or follow lifestyle advice your doctor recommends  you aren't going to improve your health  if we're going to reduce costs through prevention  all of us all must take responsibility for taking better care of ourselves and i will have more to say about that later  the second way to bring costs under control is to bring our health care system's record keeping into the  st century  finally leaving behind paper records and outdated  obsolete   th century information technology  right now  if you're rushed to a hospital with a medical emergency  they may not be able to access your medical history or to find out what medications you're taking  what surgeries you've had   or even what your blood type is  electronic medical records would change that  this is also important in the event of catastrophes  after katrina  medical records were under water  never to be recovered  a lot of people who were taking prescription drugs who fled their homes or were rescued didn't even know the names of the drugs they were taking  only  those who had been buying drugs from drug stores that had electronic medical records could immediately access to find out what the drug was and what the prescription should be  modernizing our system will improve quality of care and reduce costs  today  processing paper claims costs an average of   to   per claim  it costs   cents for an electronic claim  a rand study found that  as a nation  we could save more than   billion annually through the widespread use of electronic medical records  and these savings could double with the addition of prevention and chronic disease management  if the use of information technology impacts our health care system as much as it has impacted other sectors of the economy  like for example  the wholesale and retail industry  we could see savings as high as   billion annually or over   of health care spending  there is no reason why people's health files   their test results  lab records  x rays   can't be stored securely and confidentially on a computer file accessible from a doctor's office or hospital  in fact  if all hospitals used a computerized physician order entry system  an estimated   fewer adverse drug events would occur  saving roughly   billion per year  we can also use information technology to disseminate research  a government study recently showed it takes   years from the time of a new medical discovery to the time clinicians actually incorporate that discovery into their practice at the bedside  why not   seconds  the moment we know the discovery improves care  the veterans medical system provides a perfect example of a fully automated health information system that supports the needs of patients  clinicians  and administrators  its computerized patient record system  cprs  contains every detail of a patient's health record  including laboratory test results  medical images  bar code medication administration  progress notes  and appointments  all accessible from anywhere within the va system  the va started modernizing its programs in   using health it as well as other care management techniques  and it delivers some of the best quality health care in the united states with amazing efficiency  between   and   the number of patients enrolled in the va system increased by   percent  yet funding  not adjusted for inflation  increased by only   percent  so the va has not only has become one of the health care industry's best quality performers  it has done so while spending less and less on each patient  health care spending per capita averages  as i said  over   in the u s  at the va  however  the per patient cost is   and   lower than the national average  even though the average age of a va patient is   last year i was at the hospital here at gw announcing legislation that has since passed the senate that promotes the use of information technology so we can end the paper chase  limit medical errors and reduce the number of malpractice suits  it would allow us to use it to develop a nationwide  interoperable system  to streamline our healthcare costs  and  i believe  reduce errors as well  now  i'm proud of my legislation  we didn't get it passed in the house last year  we're going to try again this year  but if we don't get it passed  i will have it as one of my highest priorities as president  i'm going to build on that legislation by requiring health providers that participate in federal programs  which is nearly all of them  to adopt private  secure  and interoperable technology  and to help hospitals and doctors modernize their systems and promote the widespread adoption of health it  i would invest   billion a year in grants to help ramp up the system  no more yellowing paper records   no more trying to decipher messy handwriting  third  we're finally going to coordinate and streamline the care our chronically ill patients receive  americans with chronic disease such as heart disease and diabetes account for an astonishing percentage  when i first saw this  i couldn't believe it that it was   percent of our national health care expenditures  and improving the quality of their care will help limit costs  and improve health  to that end  i propose establishing medical  homes  similar to those operating right now in oregon  dr  david dorra  a primary care physician  spoke at the senate aging committee  on which i serve  two weeks ago about the success of these medical homes  he told the story of a patient  ms  viera  a   year old woman in oregon who suffered from five chronic illnesses  including diabetes  high blood pressure  and mild congestive heart failure  she also had difficulties remembering what bills to pay and what pills to take  now  in most clinics across this country  ms  viera would receive care from qualified  capable doctors and nurses  but her care would likely not be coordinated   her providers wouldn't be talking to each other  making sure that the treatments they were prescribing were working together  this ends up raising costs and increasing the chances that she will suffer complications or end up back in the hospital  anyone who has ever tried to coordinate their own care  or the care of a loved one  knows that this is all too common situation  fortunately  her care was addressed comprehensively through care management plus in oregon  an it system with trained care managers in primary care clinics to treat older adults with complicated conditions  she's is in good hands  her care managers and her primary care physician addressed her symptoms early  preventing problems rather than treating them after they occurred  and she is helped to navigate the system  under this program  seniors with complex diabetes have had a   percent reduction in mortality  a   percent reduction in expensive hospitalization  and up to   percent improvement in control of their disease  every patient should have access to a system with outcomes like that  that's why my proposal would require that americans with costly  hard to manage illnesses have access to state of the art chronic care coordination models under federally funded plans  like medicare and the federal employees health benefits  fehbp  plan  this proposal would permit multi specialty clinics  gw  mayo clinic  johns hopkins  partners healthcare  provider sponsored organizations and private plans to bid on and provide services such as care coordination amongst and between providers  drug management  diet and exercise control and the promotion of individual patient responsibility  we know that this coordinated care model would result in significant cost savings  a recent rand study concluded that chronic disease management  preceded by prevention and backed by information technology  could save   billion annually  another study found this model could reduce the cost of diabetes care alone by   percent  saving us   billion dollars  fourth  my plan will offer will offer individuals and small businesses market access to larger insurance pools that will lower costs and end insurance company discrimination against people with pre existing conditions  as part of a plan for universal coverage  which i will discuss in detail in the coming months  we would create large insurance pools that lower administrative costs for small businesses and individuals by spreading the risk  in a system of universal coverage insurance companies cannot as easily shift costs through cherry picking and other means  in fact  according to a recent mckinsey report  insurance companies in america spend tens of billions a year figuring out how not to cover people   doing complicated calculations to figure out how to cherry pick the healthiest persons  and leave everyone else out in the cold  that is how they profit  by avoiding insuring patients who will be  expensive    and then trying to avoid paying up once the insured patient actually needs treatment  i see this all the time  my office spends countless hours arguing with insurance companies to get my constituents the health care they have paid for  for example  a father called me from northern new york   his son had a rare illness  now he and his son were well insured  he'd worked for many years for the same employer who provided a good policy  but when his son needed a special operation   that could only be performed at one place in the country   the insurance company said  sorry  that's out of network  we're not going to send you to have that done  so my office intervened  and in the end they got permission for the operation  but i don't think people should have to go to their united states senator to get their insurance company to give them what they've paid for  as president  i will end the practice of insurance company cherry picking once and for all by allowing anyone who wants to join a plan to do so and prohibiting insurance companies from carving out benefits or charging higher rates to people with health problems  i also will call for rating reforms to ensure that older and other vulnerable populations are not discriminated against  the whole point of insurance  lest we forget  is to spread risk across a group of enrollees  it's one of the reasons that the administrative costs of medicare are so much lower  because they are actually insuring everyone  everyone is in the pool  and we have to figure out how to better control the costs within medicare but they start with an advantage because they have such a considerably lower administrative cost  finally  insurers would be required to prove they were spending much less on marketing and schemes to avoid providing insurance to high risk americans  and more on direct care giving  now most businesses and some states have become tough purchasers of health insurance  insisting on fair marketing and cracking down on high overhead  we should follow their lead  one of the things i've advocated now for   years is a common vocabulary and a common form that every insurance company must use  this sounds like a pretty common sense idea so you can actually compare and contrast what you're paying for but when i proposed in back in   and   it was  shall we say  vigorously objected to  because we need more transparency and we need that common vocabulary in order to get costs down  and that's opposite of what the insurers want to happen  by insuring all americans through accountable public and private plans  we can get rid of administrative costs that do nothing but add to insurance companies' bottom line  in such a reformed system  risk would be widely spread and we could reduce administrative costs by as much as   to   billion a year  fifth  i will work to improve the quality of care which will also help us drive down costs  i'll start by establishing an independent public private best practices institute  this institute would be a partnership among the public and the private sector  to finance comparative effectiveness research  so that doctors  nurses and other health professionals   as well as consumers and businesses   would know what drugs  devices  surgeries and treatments work best  this would reduce the use of inefficient and ineffective treatments  and i believe that it would have tremendous benefits because we could get evidence based medicine into the bloodstream of the country much more effectively  i spearheaded a similar proposal to authorize the agency for healthcare research and quality to start doing research on comparative effectiveness at the department of health and human services  eight reports have been released and dozens more are underway  one of the things they're finding is a lot of these so called  blockbuster drugs  are no more effective  and sometimes less effective  in treating conditions than old standbys that have been around for a long time  and don't have all the advertising of  you know  people running through fields of wildflowers that convince patients that they need the new drug  as opposed to the one that has worked well  too often  doctors and patients don't know which medical interventions are most effective   and which have little benefit  a recent study by dartmouth researchers shows that close to one third of the   trillion we spend goes to care that is duplicative and fails to improve patient health   in fact  the researchers posited that it may even make health worse  more care is not necessarily better care  and inefficient care may do more harm than good  my plan will provide incentives to encourage doctors to keep up with the research and prescribe the most effective treatments  the university of michigan and pitney bowes are doing just that   linking out of pocket drug costs to clinical benefit for patients  the more effective the medication  the less that patient has to pay for the drug  as of   pitney bowes had saved more than   million dollars using this method  another innovative idea is the geisinger health system's suggestion of a medical warranty  it charges a flat fee for surgery that includes   days of follow up treatment  currently  there is little incentive to seek out the most effective treatments  because if a treatment regimen or surgery doesn't work  the patient simply returns for more costly treatments  the warranty is an incentive to do it right the first time  because there is no extra billing if more care is needed  geisinger doctors have identified   essential steps to bypass surgery  and they've established procedures to ensure they're always followed  the best practices institute will empower with information and evidence those who have to make the decisions  it will not only be beneficial with respect to pharmaceuticals but also medical devices and even practice protocols and i think that it will give a lot of doctor's ammunition against insurance companies  drug companies and even sometimes patients about what works better than other options  the oregon drug effectiveness review founded by governor john kitzhaber in   is a collaborative partnership between states and non profits that conducts reviews of widely used drugs to promote the most effective ones  north carolina has used such reviews to educate providers  saving the state an estimated   million in   alone  now i can't extrapolate how much we would save as a nation  but i believe it would obviously be in the billions  sixth  if we want to get health care costs under control  we need to get prescription drug costs under control  we know that americans pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs that we have already in most instances funded the research on funded the clinical trials on  done the fda evaluation of  then we put it into the market place and we end up still paying the highest prices   studies have shown that brand drug prices are   to   percent higher in the u s  and top selling medications a full   times more expensive compared to other industrialized countries  over the past decade  prescription drugs accounted for   percent of the total increase in health spending  even though they account for only about   percent of what other countries spend  let's start getting drug costs under control by allowing medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and to lower those costs for everyone  we also have to crack down on the overpayments in medicare to private plans  these private plan payment rates are around   percent higher than medicare traditionally pays to treat the same beneficiaries  reducing these overpayments could save medicare   to   billion dollars a year  seniors don't want to lose the benefits they have under these plans  but under my reforms they would not  we should also allow the importation of drugs from certain countries to lower costs and let's remove barriers to generic competition  while   percent of all prescriptions are generic medicines  they account for only   percent of total pharmaceutical costs  a one percent increase in the use of generics could yield   billion dollars in government savings  we need to break the monopoly that biotech pharmaceutical companies have over their products  which can cost us so much money  most americans have no idea that right now  under current law and fda practice  generic biopharmaceuticals are precluded from going to the market  and businesses and consumers are paying for that  you know the cost differential between generic and non generic drugs is astounding  in   the average cost for a one day supply of non generic drugs was   but only   for generic drugs  there is bipartisan support for providing the long overdue authority for the fda to approve generic products that are the biologics  already  an unprecedented coalition of patients' groups  labor  business  pharmacists  governors and a number of forward looking biotech companies have united to support legislation that i introduced with senator charles schumer and congressman henry waxman  providing such competition is projected to save   to   billion dollars a year in savings to businesses and consumers  the final point that i would make today about lowering costs is to reduce costs through medical malpractice reform  while some have overstated the role that malpractice insurance plays in the health care crisis  i think we can all agree that we need reform that works for doctors and patients alike  i have offered one solution that has been used successfully at the university of michigan hospital system  it's called the national medical error disclosure and compensation  medic  act as i have borrowed it from the university of michigan to put it into law  it's a novel approach to improving patient safety and the quality of health care while protecting patients' rights  reducing medical errors and lowering malpractice costs  this act would encourage physicians  hospitals and health systems to provide liability protections for physicians who disclose medical errors to patients and offer to enter into negotiations for fair compensation  at the university of michigan  these policies have already resulted in greater patient trust and satisfaction  more patients being compensated for injuries  fewer malpractice suits  significantly reduced administrative costs and between one and three million dollars in litigation cost savings  the rise in malpractice rates has spurred states like texas and nevada to allow doctors to create their own risk retention companies as an alternative to traditional liability insurance  because a large percentage of actual malpractice is committed by a very small percentage of doctors who won't be included in insurance groups that other doctors control  thereby lowering malpractice rates for all  now as i have made clear in these seven points  we know that if we continue on our present path  health care costs in the u s  will double within a decade  we know that we will spend increasing amounts and we aren't sure  and i think it is fair to say we know  that we won't improve quality and outcome  now how will this actually work  well it has to be implemented over time according again to rand who has been studying healthcare costs intensely now for several years  we could save   billion dollars from the information technology changes i have recommended    to   billion dollars in administrative savings every year    billion in savings from overpayments for pharmaceuticals and health plans  and there are billions more in countless other inefficiencies that could be rung out of our often wasteful health care system  we also will have to move toward a system where it is doctor patient centered and consumer driven if we expect to really get the results that we need  now there is no question that at least   billion dollars in projected savings that i have included in my plan are not only reasonable  but extremely conservative  now i know that a lot of this is kind of overly wonky  which is why i am glad there is an audience of people here today who really understand a lot of these issues  but i imagine  you know  many people wonder what all this adds up to  well the business roundtable has recently estimated that just with a system that used information technology  the typical family would save   dollars  and i think that is a pretty impressive outcome for us doing what we need to be doing anyway  the money we save from the waste we eliminate and the way we change how we care for people should be used to help finance coverage for the   million americans who have no insurance  also  when you insure everyone  it will maximize the impact of the prevention programs i have recommended   with earlier care as opposed to emergency care   as well as cutting administrative costs  our present system is outdated  ineffective  and unsustainable  we know how to do this  many of you in this audience could give me ten more suggestions that we need to do immediately  well the key is to develop the political will to make it happen through a coalition of those who are most directly affected  the people who deliver care  our doctors  our nurses our pharmacists and others  the people who pay for care  our business and our government and the people who receive care which is all the rest of us  because i know very well that every one of these recommendations will run into considerable opposition from forces that do not want change in our system  so i believe that equally importantly to having a plan  we have to have a political consensus and that is what i am trying to develop as i talk about healthcare and engage in a conversation with the american people because i think americans are ready for change  they are ready for a healthcare system that produces better results at lower cost and ends the shame of us not covering   million plus of our fellow americans  i look forward to your ideas about how we can pursue these goals and i hope you will join with me in being part of this broad based  national coalition that will not only talk about and demand change  but work to make sure  starting in   that our political system actually delivers the changes we all know our healthcare system desperately needs  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", "thank you  so much  thank you  david  for that very kind introduction  i appreciate your being here with me in a few minutes  i will be having an opportunity to discuss some of the issues that affect middle class families here in iowa and across america  with three local residents who have been kind enough to participate  and then we'll have a chance to throw it open to the audience  i appreciate david mitchell  ph  and katy vanderpool  ph  and don cousins  ph  for being part of this discussion  and i also want to thank janet adams  your former state representative and my county coordinator  for helping to put this event together  yes  let's give janet a round of applause   applause  i'm delighted that mayor eugene gray is here  thank you for welcoming me to your city  and i also want to introduce someone else who i'm proud to call a friend and also one of my national co chairs at my campaign  and that's your former governor  tom vilsack  tom  thank you   applause  today  we're going to continue the conversation that i'm having across iowa and america about how we rebuild the road to a strong and prosperous middle class  yesterday  in cedar rapids  i proposed a new economic blueprint for  st century america  a plan to create new jobs  to make a commitment to clean energy and innovation  which will be a job engine and creator  just as it is being now here in iowa  to restore fairness to our economy  it's not right that people at the very top are doing so well and everybody else is marking time  we have the largest inequality in our country that we've had since the great depression  that is not a recipe for success for the vast majority of americans  we need to put our fiscal house in order again  six and a half years ago  we had a balanced budget and a surplus  that has been squandered  to our great detriment   applause  i want to renew the basic bargain that i grew up with  that i was taught about  that if you work hard and you're responsible  you can get ahead in our country  and today i want to speak about one important part of that basic bargain  the promise of a secure retirement  you know  as americans we believe that if you help make america stronger  safer and more prosperous  then you should be able to count on your retirement years being better  healthier and more secure  but the reality today is far different from what that basic bargain used to deliver  fewer than one half of american families have retirement savings accounts in any given year  and those who do contribute are saving too little for their futures  nearly one third of all households entering retirement do not have enough savings to replace even one half of their income  and that is including social security  one half have saved just   or less in a  k  or ira type plan  the private savings rate last year fell to its lowest level since the great depression  all of this fits together  if you're not making money that is a part of a rising economy  it's hard to save  and if the costs of health care and education and energy keep going up  it's even harder to save  so many americans have worked hard their entire lives  they've contributed to their communities  they've done everything right  but when it came time to retire  they came up short  they worry that their children will have to support them  they worry that they'll have to keep working  and i have met people across our country working not just into their late sixties or seventies  but into their early eighties because they just don't have enough to keep things going for them  they worry that medicare and social security won't be enough to make ends meet  and then the younger generation is trying to raise their own kids  care for aging parents  plan for their own retirement  and as their government turns a blind eye  they face the pressure themselves of stagnant wages and all of these increasing costs   and  on top of what's happening now  a softening housing market  which has always been the main source of wealth and security for most americans  too many families in america today feel like they're standing on a trap door  they're just one diagnosis  one pink slip  one missed mortgage payment away from falling through and losing everything  what's been the bush administration's answer to these real world problems  well  it's always the same answer  help those with the most and good luck to everybody else  they want to privatize social security and let individuals bear the risk  they want to create retirement savings accounts  which allows the wealthiest americans to get the best deal  they have little concern for everybody else  they put tax breaks for drug companies and oil companies ahead of retirement security for hardworking americans  during the last six and a half years  on president bush's watch  the share of american workers covered by employer sponsored retirement plans has fallen below   percent for the first time  four million fewer workers have access to employer sponsored pensions than they did when president bush took office  now  they call their vision of our country the  ownership society  the reality is  they own it  you work for it  i call it the  yoyo society    you're on your own  that's how they seem to think that america should be  i reject that  for six long years  the middle class in our country has been as though it were invisible to their president  you know  if you're working hard  you're paying your bills and you have nothing left over to save at the end of the month  you're invisible  if you're working two jobs  like a lot of people are today  but neither of them has a retirement plan  you're invisible  too  if you've worked all your life to do what is right  only to realize you cannot afford to retire  well  you're sure invisible as well  well  you're not invisible to me  and when we take back the white house  you will no longer be invisible to the president of the united states   applause  i believe it's time for a new bargain with the american people  a bargain that reflects the changing global economy and the new realities of our aging  i believe if you do work hard and you contribute to your country  you should have the opportunity to save and invest  and through the discipline of good planning and the miracle of compound interest  you should be able to build wealth for yourself and a better future for your family and a secure retirement  that's what i want to talk about today  my plan to help a new generation of americans save and build wealth  you know  it's really kind of ironic  because part of the american dream has always been you work hard today to build a better future and to make it better for your children and your grandchildren  that's how i was raised  you know  my family lived better than my grandparents  bill and i lived better than my parents and his  our daughter is living well  we want every generation to do better  if you look at what's happening today  older people have actually more assets  even though it's not enough to retire comfortably  than their own children and grandchildren do  think of all of the children moving back to live with parents  think of all the single moms struggling to raise children  and grandparents having to help  so this is not only about securing a better retirement for those who are on the brink of retiring but helping to build more assets and wealth for young people  like the ones you'll hear about in a minute  i think every american deserves a chance to build a solid next egg  to help save for that new home  to send a child to college and to secure that comfortable retirement  i believe strongly that we can do this  and it's important that we do it  because right now our savings rates are below what they were in   we don't have much of a nest egg to fall back on  we sure don't have it any longer in our government because we're back into deficits and debt  and every day we borrow money from foreign countries  and what do we borrow it for  for president bush's two main priorities  tax cuts for the wealthiest and the war in iraq  we need to change those priorities  we need to start once again respecting the social security trust fund and beginning to bring our troops home from iraq so that we will have those resources to spend here at home   applause  look at what happens today  we spend as a government   as our government  we spend about   billion a year to encourage retirement savings  but under the tax code  about half of that   billion goes to the top   percent of earners  but only   percent goes to the bottom   percent of earners  we are subsidizing the most the people who need it the least  many workers don't even have the opportunities that would encourage them to save  when you think about how few employees now actually have access to an employer who sponsors a retirement plan  you wonder what's going to happen to everybody else  but even those who have access to a retirement plan  not nearly enough of them are encouraged or given the opportunity to save  so we've got a lot of workers  more than half in america right now  without any employer based retirement savings account  including   workers right here in iowa  think about that    it's maybe not something you talk about with your neighbors  but that's a lot of people right here in webster city and across iowa  and many parts of the workforce are even worse off  think about how it affects women  particularly single women  women who work full  time are likely to have on the same level as their male counterparts a retirement plan  but a lot of women don't work full time  they work part time or  i like to say  they work two part time jobs to try to make enough money to support themselves and their children  you know  yesterday for lunch we stopped at a maid rite on our way from cedar rapids to marshalltown  and the waitress who served us was a single mom  she's raised two boys  they're now in their twenties  she and her boys have worked hard every single day for a lot of years  she works at a nursing home and she works at a maid rite  she doesn't have much to count on when it comes to retirement except for social security  a lot of these workers are left behind  but i think we know what to do  we just need a president who believes it's important to do this  when people have access to retirement accounts like  k s that provide generous matches  they save more  in a recent study  middle  class americans saved eight times more when they were given a   percent match  and we know that by making it easier with automatic enrollment  direct deposit and diversified investment options  people are more likely to build up their nest egg  that's why i'm announcing my plan today to provide every single american with an easy  automatic opportunity to save for future through an account i'm calling an american retirement account  these accounts will take the best of the  k  plans and make them available to every working family  they will help families and individuals who are falling through the cracks  they will reduce the way the tax code skews for the wealthy  they will begin to bring down this inequality that is eating away at our social contract  and they will encourage national savings and economic growth  this is a major commitment to how i think we can begin to right the balance again  here's how american retirement accounts will work  to give a strong incentive for saving  my plan will offer working and middle class families generous matching tax cuts  for families making up to   a year  the government will match dollar for dollar the first   you save  for families making between   and   the plan will provide a   percent match on the first   of savings  that means tens of millions of middle class families will be eligible for matching tax cuts of up to   and   to help them build a nest egg  the new american retirement accounts will build upon and strengthen the existing employer based retirement savings systems  if you like your current retirement savings options  you keep them as they are  no change is necessary  but if you don't have a retirement savings plan or you don't like the one you have  you will be able to open a new american retirement account that will provide no hassle  portable savings opportunities throughout your career  these universal accounts will allow you to contribute up to   a year on a cash deferred basis  you will get the generous government matches on the first   so although  k s now are only available to some  they will be available to everyone  saving in the accounts will be easy  it should not require a ph d  to save for retirement  we'll encourage employers to let employees directly deposit a portion of their salaries into the account  savings will happen automatically unless a worker opts out  we'll provide expanded tax credits to smaller businesses to help cover the start up costs of establishing direct deposit options  and we'll ensure there are secured  diversified investment options in these accounts  your account will be yours  you will be able to take it from job to job and roll over any existing retirement savings into the account  this is particularly important for women  women  as we know  are more likely to go in and out of the workforce  as a woman who has worked   i started working  i think  when i was   in the summer time  and i got my first social security then  i worked part time  i worked full time  and  of course  when bill was president i didn't work outside the home  as we might say  and so i know that women go in and out of the workforce to raise children  to take care of their parents   so many issues that affect our lives  i would also make it easier for small businesses and for self  employed people  who often get the worst of all worlds   they can't afford health care  they can't afford to save for retirement  we're going to address that  why should we be satisfied with our current system  a system in which a mother who chooses to stay home and raise her children misses out on savings opportunities that others can access  why should we be satisfied with a system in which starting your own business means passing up employer sponsored retirement benefits  why should we be satisfied with a system in which part time employees don't have incentives or an easy way to save  well  i'm not satisfied  that's why i want to change the system  and i want to make it available to every american  under my plan you'll also be able to use the savings in your american retirement account to make major life investments  like buying a home or paying for higher education  in addition  in light of the growing economic uncertainty facing american families  we should consider ways to let workers access a portion of their savings to weather difficult times  like an illness or an accident that has affected you  in short  my plan will help tens of millions of middle class families go from just getting by to getting ahead  now  i know some people will say   well  we can't afford to invest in the american people  well  i think we can't afford not to invest in the american people  we need to do it  and we can do it in a fiscally responsible way  we will cover the cost of these middle class retirement tax cuts with a portion of revenue from freezing the estate tax  for every one wealthy estate facing a less generous estate tax exemption  thousands of middle class families will receive a tax cut that will help them save  invest  and one day own an estate of their own  i think it's imperative that we start giving people the chance to acquire wealth again  otherwise  we're going to become a two tier society  we'll have the rich  and we'll have everybody else  that is not the america i grew up in  and i don't think that's the way america works best  as we encourage individuals to save on their own  we will shore up existing employer sponsored pensions  i fought in the senate to ensure that companies funded   percent of their defined benefit pension obligations  i want to strengthen defined benefit coverage  we're going to finally close the loophole when i'm president in our pension laws that allows companies to cut their employees' pensions when they sell off subsidiaries  one of the most egregious examples of this was when halliburton used this loophole to rob its employees of   million in pension benefits they had earned  and then they turned around and rewarded their then ceo  dick cheney  with a   million sweetheart retirement deal  you could not have a clearer example of what is wrong with america  why on earth should any company be permitted legally to deprive workers of what they'd earned in order to give a ceo the same amount in benefits   applause  we also need to examine our bankruptcy code  to ensure that companies are not using bankruptcy to get out of their obligations to workers  you know  bankruptcy is an unfortunate fact of life for some struggling companies  but when a company runs into hard times  we need to give workers and retirees a fair chance to negotiate for the benefits they've earned  i would also restore the pension benefit guarantee corporation to its historic role as an advocate for worker retirement benefits  i'll continue the work that i've done in the senate to secure retirement benefits for law enforcement officers  military veterans and september  th heroes  and i'll work to strengthen spousal protections to ensure that widows and qualified divorced widows receive the retirement benefits they are due  finally  the bedrock of my retirement savings agenda is a fundamental commitment to social security  i don't think there's any doubt that we've got to fight and finally bury the idea of privatizing social security  it is one of those bad ideas that deserve to be totally buried   applause  when i am president  privatizing social security will certainly not be even discussed  i reject the view of president bush and others who have given large tax cuts to the wealthiest  failed to crack down on offshore tax dodgers  and handed out no bid contracts to companies like halliburton  and then insisted that we needed to cut benefits to middle class retirees  how can they get the top   percent of americans a tax cut large enough to essentially fix social security and then turn around and say   oh  we have no choice but to cut social security benefits  don't you believe all these people running around crying wolf about social security  that is exactly what they're doing  they're trying to get people confused and upset and agree to a bad deal  when i am president  we'll have our priorities in order  we will return to fiscal responsibility and fair tax policies first  and then we will address the long term challenges facing social security  but i'm not going about demanding sacrifice from seniors and having others dismantle social security because they claim they can't cut back on the tax breaks for wealthy americans and big corporations  when my husband left office  because we had a balanced budget and a surplus  there was a plan in place to extend the solvency of social security until   that gives us plenty of time to figure out what else we need to do  once george bush came in and we went back to deficit spending  the last six and a half years what we've seen is a decrease in the life of the social security trust fund to   well  when we get back to fiscal responsibility  we'll start paying back the social security trust fund  and that will give us a strong foundation to go toward fixing all of the long term challenges that social security faces  in my work  i will be guided by a belief that each generation owes a great deal to the ones that come before it and owe a great deal to the ones that are coming after  i'm grateful for what my parents did for me and what their generation did for all of us  you know  my father was kind of old fashioned  he had a small business and he didn't believe in debt  in fact  it was the explosion of the deficit during the  s that turned my rock ribbed republican father into an open minded voter   laughter  he began to say   you know what  your mother and i saved until we could buy our house  we saved until we could buy a car  we saved  and now my government's going into debt  i think there's a lot of wisdom in that  you know  it's the same father who taught me to turn off lights when i left a room  we got to get back to some of those habits  you know  i think in the world in which we are facing challenges from new competitors  threats and dangers that are real  we've got to start acting like americans again  we got to roll up or sleeves and claim that this country is worth fighting for and saving  and  inaudible  that we get back on the right track   applause  so i'm excited to be here to unveil these plans  because i believe that we can do this  i'm absolutely confident and optimistic  i know everybody says   well  we can't get anything done in washington  but when you think about it  president bush really wanted to divide america  unfortunately  i regret that deeply  there's a lot we can get done if we're working together  that's what i've done in the senate  you know  before i got to the senate a lot of people didn't know whether i could or would work with republicans  one of the republicans famously said after i got elected   well  maybe lightning will strike before she gets here   laughter  well  thankfully  it didn't   laughter  but when i got there  i rolled up my sleeves  because i was elected to help the people who sent me to the senate  when i'm president  i'm going to roll them up even higher  and we're going to get to work together  and one of the things we're going to do is to help americans once again face the future with security and have a retirement plan that really helps middle class americans  that's what i pledge to you  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", " b hillary clinton delivered remarks in clear lake  ia today about her experience and vision for a new america  the following is an excerpt from her speech b   a couple of my leading opponents  directly and through surrogates  have spent months criticizing me without having to answer any of their own questions  they've been attacking my character  as i have said repeatedly  i really would prefer to attack the problems of the country and let my opponents run their own campaigns   but i have to set the record straight  because often what you don't know can be far more important than what you do know  the people of iowa  i know  are good people who are trying very hard to make the right decision in this caucus  but people can only act on what they know  and i've heard a lot of talk about turning the page  but what about the action to back it up   when it comes to health care  one of my opponents believes it's acceptable to leave out   million americans  that would be   here in iowa  leave them out from his health care plan because universal coverage might be too hard to achieve  i disagree  i don't think we should start by giving up on   million americans  that's why my health care plan covers everyone  when it comes to social security  one of my opponents uses the republican talking points and has been open to raising the retirement age and cutting benefits  now he says he is for lifting the payroll tax  which would be a trillion dollar tax increase  again  i disagree  i don't think we should fix social security on the backs of our seniors and the middle class  i have always fought for social security  i have always stood up against privatization  and as president  i will restore fiscal responsibility so we can keep social security as a sacred promise to our seniors   when it comes to iran  i took a stand for aggressive diplomacy  one of my opponents made a different choice  he didn't show up for the vote  he didn't speak out during a presidential debate that night  and finally  he decided to play politics and claim that the vote he missed   a vote for diplomacy   was really a vote for war  well if he really thought it was a rush to war  why did he rush to campaign and miss the vote   now  there's been a lot of talk about yes or no answers to complex questions  but most people don't know that for legislators who don't want to take a stand  there's a third way to vote  not yes  not no  but  present    which is kind of like voting  maybe  well  in the illinois state senate  on issue after issue  my opponent voted  present  instead of yes or no  seven of those votes were on a woman's right to choose  two of those votes were on measures to protect families from gun violence   one of which was a measure about firing guns on or near school grounds   a president can't vote  present  a president can't pick and choose which challenges he or she will face  my opponent's campaign said that voting  present  was a strategy to provide political cover  the chicago tribune said the present votes were the equivalent of taking a pass  instead of looking for political cover or taking a pass  we need a president who will take a stand and stand there and do whatever is necessary for their country   standing up for america's values and protecting our country and our people is the first job of the president  bringing us together to end the war  fixing our economy  and taking on big challenges like immigration  health care  energy independence  climate change and so much else is what i will do   a president can't dodge the big fights  can't find political cover  or have words speak louder than actions  a lot of words we have these days aren't matched by action  and much of the actions i see  i simply disagree with  i have a very clear record on all of these issues  a record of   years of fighting for children and families  fighting for working people  fighting for our future   and as president  i will keep on fighting  but i'm running on more than just my record and my experience  i am also running on my vision and agenda of a new beginning for america   we need a new beginning on health care  we need to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and provide health care for every single man  woman and child  at a price that people can afford and we're going to give them the help to do that "], ["clinton", " i want to start with a comment or two about the economy  as we saw over night  this is a global economic crisis  it has pushed the fed for an emergency meeting and by phone with a rate cut this morning in an effort to try to take whatever action can be taken on the monetary side to begin to try to stabilize this situation which is obviously deteriorating   i think it's imperative that the following step be taken  the president should have already and should do so very quickly  convene the president's working group on financial markets  that's something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do  we don't have any information that he has done so as of last night  but i would urge him to do that  this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world   secondly  the meeting that i understand is going to take place today  with respect to a stimulus package  must produce an agreement that can be quickly passed  i have been advocating for some time a package of actions  the one area that i still hear nothing about from the white house of any significance is what will be done to deal with the mortgage crisis  those of you who have covered me know that i have spoken about this consistently because i believe it is a critical part of what we must do  we need a combination of spending  regulatory action with respect to the housing market  and rebates through the tax system   secondly  it would be incredibly short sighted not to include those people who do not currently pay income taxes  we have fifty to seventy million people who are seniors on fixed incomes  who are working people who don't make enough money to actually pay income tax  that they have to get some help  everything i've heard from the white house would leave these people out   i think that is a mistake fiscally and it is certainly a tremendous oversight with respect to what these families and individuals are going through  i would reiterate my call for a moratorium on foreclosures for ninety days and a rate freeze for five years to try to stabilize this housing market  there may be other ways to do it such as opening up the bankruptcy code  which i would certainly be open to  but we've got to address this big piece of business   finally  i think that as we look at what is happening in the economy  it's very important to recognize how the policies of the last seven years have contributed to the situation we find ourselves in  there is no doubting my mind that the american consumer has largely sustained the global economy  what's happening in a lot of these markets around the world is that the fear that the american consumer will stop spending has moved like a contagion through the global markets because  clearly  we have not only spent at extraordinary levels in the federal government  with all of the spending that we haven't paid for and that  i think  is coming home to roost  as well   the american consumer  because of he increasing costs of everything that makes up a middle class life or just making it day by day   health care  education  energy costs   have all gone up because of the failures of this administration  we need action across the board and it's imperative that the president and his economic team instill confidence in the competence of our government to take on what is clearly now a global crisis that could very well thrust us into a deep  long recession  we've got to do everything we can to avoid that "], ["clinton", "thank you all so much  thank you  thank you  oh  thank you so much  it may be a little cold outside but it sure is warm with all these democrats making a lot of noise about what we believe in and what we care about  i am thrilled to be with you  i want to thank lieutenant governor barbara lawton for her leadership and for that really extraordinary introduction  i am so grateful to her  i want to recognize and thank governor jim doyle  who is here as well  chairman joe wineke and the entire wisconsin democratic party  i want to thank also my colleagues in the senate  but i really should thank all of you for sending herb kohl and russ feingold to washington i don't have to tell you what extraordinary leaders they are  how much influence they exercise  we all listen when either one of them speak  and it is a great personal privilege for me to serve with them and consider them friends  i also want to recognize your congressional democratic delegation  gwen moore and steve kagen  they have been extraordinary in a short period of time  and of course my dear friend and one of my co chairs tammy baldwin  thank you all very much  i know former congressman and now mayor tom barrett is here  and to all of you who are supporting this event  raising money for this party  committed to not only doing everything possible to have a great election on tuesday with as big a turnout as we can muster  but then to make sure we go on to victory in november and that wisconsin is in the column of the democratic president who we will be electing  i know we are ready  we are long past ready  we are anxious to take back the white house  and on january     the next president of the united states will raise his or her hand and take the oath of office  and then will immediately inherit the problems that will be left to us to solve by president bush  now we're here tonight to make sure that our next president is a democrat  because after seven long years of george w  bush  seven years of incompetence  corruption  cronyism  seven years of this government of the few  by the few  and for the few  we have to bring change to america and put our country back on the right track  i think about that day because obviously i've been deeply honored and privileged to have lived it in the past with my husband  i know that after the swearing in ceremony and all of the activities at the capitol  after the walk down pennsylvania avenue and the parade  after the inaugural balls  the president will walk into the oval office and waiting there will be two wars  an economy in trouble  millions and millions of our fellow citizens  including   right here in wisconsin without health care  problems that we think we can predict now  and all of those that we can't even imagine  an energy crisis to solve  alliances to rebuild  a homeland to protect  instead of solving our problems we've had a president who has stood in our way  he's used fear to divide us and fatalism to discourage us  he wants us to believe we can't solve our problems  he wants us to think we shouldn't even try  well  like so much of george bush's presidency  this has done a grave disservice to america  america's character is strong  our resilience is ever present  we will survive the eight years of george bush and dick cheney and enter the future with confidence and optimism again  unlike our republican friends  we democrats still believe america is the  can do  nation  we still believe that tomorrow will be better than today  and we know it is time we started acting like americans again  it has been disheartening  to say the least  to see the narrowing of horizons  the loss of opportunity  the sense that the american dream is receding and eroding  i have been given opportunities because of this country that my parents never had and my grandparents never dreamt of  opportunities that came because of people who  generation after generation  believed with all their heart there wasn't a problem we couldn't solve  a challenge we couldn't meet  an opportunity we could not seize  people who built our country  who raised the families  who marched and protested and risked their lives because they looked into their children's eyes and they saw reflected back at them the promise of a better future  senator obama and i stand here tonight because of all those who came before  who sacrificed so much to bring us to this moment in our history and it is a moment to celebrate  because this nation gave me every chance  because during my lifetime i have seen the barriers tumble down  the obstacles overcome  i am running for president because i believe we can do the same for every single child  we can  once again  have an america where we can say to every boy and every girl that we will give you the opportunity to live up to your god given potential  that  for me  is what this election is about  it's not about those of us who are running  it's about your families  your futures  and your country  tonight across wisconsin and across america teachers are grading papers and nurses are caring for the sick  and they need a president who hears their voices and listens to them  tonight  here in milwaukee and in cities across america  janitors are cleaning up  waitresses are pouring coffee  police officers are standing guard  and they need a president who stands up for them  tonight families are sitting down to talk after losing a job or losing a home  they need a president who will deliver solutions for them  earlier today in kenosha i was at a town hall event and i was reminded once again of why i do this work  you heard barbara say that for   years starting when i was a young lawyer for the children's defense fund  i have wanted to be a voice for those who are voiceless  i started representing abused and neglected children  children who were in the foster care system who didn't have educational or health care opportunities  i worked as the chair of the legal services corporation  appointed by president carter to expand legal services for the poor across our nation because i had a passionate commitment to equal justice under the law  in arkansas i reformed the education system so that children in the poorest community in the delta or in the inner city would have some shot at finding out what they could do if they were motivated and would work hard  and in the white house years we tackled a lot of tough problems  and one that i worked on and helped to make progress on was to create the children's health insurance program  to give six million kids across our country a chance to have health care  as i was shaking hands in the crowd after my event today in kenosha  a woman held up a sign and said   thank you for saving my daughter's life  i said   what did i do  she said   the children's health insurance program  then i met a young boy named jacob who has cerebral palsy but he is doing really well  he was standing between his two proud parents  they thanked me because they never could've afforded the operations that he had  during the town hall  i called on a little girl  she said   what are you going to do for people who don't have homes  i thought like many children that i've talked to across america that the plight of the homeless had really struck her heart  and i said   well  are you concerned about people who don't have homes  she said   yes  my mommy and me  so i asked them to come up and her mother talked about being a hairdresser  she said   my business is not as good as it was  people aren't coming in as often  they are not willing to pay what i need to make a living  i'm about to be foreclosed on  i have one of those adjustable rate mortgages  i've gone from paying   a month to   a month  i don't think we will be able to stay in our home  i'm reminded every single day why i do this  it's not about speeches for me  it's not about the bright lights and the cameras  it is about the changes we can make that actually deliver results in people's lives that give them a chance to live up and fulfill their own dreams  far from here in this beautiful ballroom  across the world our men and women in uniform are serving our country bravely and honorably  some on their second or third or even fourth tour of duty  they deserve a commander in chief who will bring them home  all americans again want  need and deserve a president who will bring your voices and your values back to the white house  i know we will all breathe a sigh of relief when that moving van pulls up in the back of the white house and george bush and dick cheney turn over the keys  but this election is not just about the failures of the past seven years or the divisions of the present or the excitement of the moment  this election must be about the future we want and how we can make it a reality  we all have dreams  we have dreams for our families  for our future  our country is founded on the idea of the american dream  that with optimism and confidence and without fear  we can make the future happen by working hard and taking responsibility  that's what has always made america great and different  this generation  like generations before us  is called to make its own commitment and sacrifice  we  too  can be a great generation to make the american dream real in the  st century  but to do that we must get real about what it will take to have the future we dream of  i once wrote a book called  it takes a village  well  i still believe that's true  i will be a president for all of you but for me to be your president and for us to reach america's promise in this century  we also have to agree that shared opportunities and shared prosperity require shared responsibility as parents  as neighbors  as workers  as business and political leaders  as a nation  this is about all of us coming together to stake our claim on what it means to be an american in this century  there are people saying that america's best days are behind us  that the competition we face from china and elsewhere will mean that we can't continue to have a strong middle class with rising incomes and the kind of quality of life and standard of living that we have taken for granted  well  i reject that  i know this will not be easy  those who claim that it can be done with relatively little effort don't understand what we're up against  we face real challenges  real threats  we have to be ready to summon the experience  the wisdom and the determination to solve our problems  it will take more than just speeches to fulfill our dreams  it will take a lot of hard work  so  if we get america back into the solutions business  if we get real about our future  i am confident that we'll be back here in five years and we will say  weren't we on top of it  didn't we understand what we had to do to make a difference  because together there isn't anything that can stop us  so let's get real about the economy  we see an america where our economy works not just for the few  the wealthy and the well connected  but works for all of us  how will we do that  well  we're going to start by creating good jobs again and by keeping the jobs we have here and preventing them from being exported like they were some disposable commodity  we can do this  we have to change our trade policy  we have to change our tax policy  we have to change our vision and understanding about what it will take to create the jobs of the future  but that's what i've been doing for years  upstate new york has a lot in common with wisconsin  we've lost our manufacturing base but i didn't say  well that's the end  we can't do it  because  you see  i don't believe we can have a strong economy and a strong country without a strong manufacturing base  so i'm going to work to make sure we get it back  let's get real about our energy policy  let's see an america that stands up to the oil companies and the oil producing countries and says   you don't need our tax dollars any longer to make outrageous profits  let's begin to take the tax subsidies away from the oil companies  let's impose a windfall profits tax on these outrageous profits and put it to work on clean renewable energy  now  i know we can't do any of this until the two oil men leave the white house but as soon as they do  we're going to be ready for a new energy future with the millions and millions of jobs that we can create  i think we can create five million jobs in the next ten years if we do this right  and there's no reason we can't  earlier today i said to the folks at the brat shop  i said look germany's creating jobs with solar power  hundreds of thousands of them  we have a lot of people in wisconsin of german descent  there are as many sunny days in wisconsin as there are in germany   let's get busy and create these jobs right here in milwaukee and in oshkosh and in green bay and in eau claire and madison  let's get real about health care  now we have a choice we have   million people uninsured and we can continue to think that's a terrible problem and do nothing about it or we can roll up our sleeves and come up with a uniquely american solution  that is what i have proposed  you see  i think it is morally wrong that you have     people in wisconsin who don't have health insurance  i think it is a national disgrace  are we saying to ourselves we just can't figure this out  we can't take on the health insurance companies  we can't take on the republicans to achieve universal health care  i don't accept that for a minute  universal health care has been a fundamental democratic party  it's been part of the progressive tradition here in wisconsin for as long as anyone can remember  we cannot in anyway cede universal health care  it should be a defining issue in this general election  i believe we can win on universal health care  let's get real about education  you know  we can't continue to have unfunded mandates coming from washington  so let's figure out what we're going to do  i will do everything possible to fully fund special education something that has been promised but never fulfilled for more then   years  and i will end the unfunded mandate know as no child left behind  it is not working for our kids and our teachers  and i believe we can make college affordable again if we take on the student loan industry and get them out of the way  get back to direct lending from the federal government   the way it used to work let's get real about restoring america's role in the world  you know as well as i do that our relationships have been destroyed  we have to rebuild our alliances  we have to be willing to find common ground with the rest of the world again  and this is not about getting everybody to like us  that's not what it's about  this is about having allies to deal with the big problems we face   global terrorism global warming global epidemics  we can't tackle those on our own  and you know you can't be a leader if no one is following  we've got to get into the leadership business again in the world  we also have to do everything we can to make it clear that restoring our leadership and our moral authority in the world starts with ending the war in iraq and bringing our troops home responsibly and quickly  i have said that i will start bringing them home within the first   days  from my position on the senate armed services committee i've been working to make sure that we are prepared to do that  you know  this administration has not planned for withdrawing our troops because they don't want to do it  they are going to leave it completely to us  so we have to be prepared to think this through  to make sure that we protect our young men and women as they depart  and then we have to ask ourselves  what do we do with the   plus civilians who are there  see  i think about this because i imagine what the responsibility will be like sitting alone in the oval office  you know  the advisors have given you their advice but ultimately it's up to you to decide  and what do we do about the iraqis who helped us  the translators who made the difference between life and death for our soldiers and our marines  we are an honorable country and we have to withdraw in a way that keeps faith with the sacrifice of those who have been lost  with those who have been injured  and we must make it clear there is no military solution  bring our people home and tell the iraqis they have to take responsibility for their own future  and as we bring them home  we have to take care of them  you know in kenosha again  a young man reached out his hand  he had a t shirt on which said us marine corps  he said   take care of my buddies  a lot of them are still over there  he said   and then will you please help take care of me  he said   i can't get an appointment for months to get my problems taken care of at the v a  you know  i think when young men and women sign up to serve america  we sign up to serve them  they deserve the health care  the compensation  the services they have earned  obviously to do all of this we have to take on the power structure in washington  i'm always a little amused when someone says   we're going to go after the special interests  there isn't anything more important then reining them in  but we've got to do it in a way that brings the american people along with us  it's not enough just to impose rules on them  which senator feingold has been such a leader on  we've got to figure out how we prevent them from taking advantage of the american people with higher prescription drug costs  with higher energy costs  with lost jobs that go overseas  this is a job for all of us  not just for our next president  we have to have a coalition that takes on all of these interests  i have an aggressive agenda that will save the american people at least   billion dollars a year  if we impose that windfall profits tax  if we get aggressive in going after the oil companies who always seem to be raising the price no matter what else is going on  if we rein in health insurance  rein in drug costs  we can begin to end these subsidies that have unfortunately shifted so much wealth away from the middle class  that's the kind of america that we have to build again  it's not going to be easy but it's doable  it's going to take strength and experience  something that goes along with the job  change is going to happen  the question is  are we going to get the right kind of change  because what i'm interested in is not just change for the sake of change  but progress  the kind of progress that will make a difference in the lives of the people of this country  and we know pretty well what the republicans will do because they're likely nominee will be senator mccain  he's a man whom i consider a friend and whom i deeply respect for his lifetime of service to our country  he's a good man with the wrong ideas  and i believe we need a nominee who can go toe to toe with john mccain to make the differences absolutely clear to the american people  he wants to keep troops in iraq for   to   years  i'll start bringing them home within   days  he's admitted he doesn't understand the economy  well  i have a strategy to end the housing crisis  when that young girl and her mother came up  i told them i'd been pushing on a moratorium on home foreclosures  end the home foreclosures for   days  let people work out a chance to stay in their homes  have the lenders understand that somebody paying   is better than an empty house because they couldn't pay   senator mccain won't deliver universal health care  i'm the only candidate left in either party with a plan to cover every single american  and these are big differences  so wisconsin democrats have a choice on tuesday  it's not an easy choice  i recognize that  it's kind of a good problem to have in a way because either senator obama or i will make history and we'll make history because of all that we are able to exemplify  everything that was done to bring both of us to this point  but the question is not who will make history  but who will change america  who will bring about the positive differences  the  st century solutions that we so desperately need  i think that the choice is really whether we're going to have a fighter  a doer and a champion again in the white house  somebody who gets up every single day with determination  backbone and  yes  toughness  i know some people have said that i am tough  you know what  we need a tough president because we have tough problems waiting for us  when i say i'll stand with you  i will stand with you  when i say i will fight for you  i will fight for you  that's what i've done my whole life  when i started my career fighting for abused and neglected children and children with disabilities  i was standing with the children who had drawn the short straw in life  well i'm still standing with them today  when i went to beijing as first lady  i stood up for the core american value that women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights  i took that message to more than   countries  to women who couldn't vote or own property or earn a salary or send their daughters to school  and i'm still standing for women's rights and human rights  when i took on the special interests to try to bring health care to every american back in   the insurance companies and the lobbyists came at me with everything they had  but i'm still here and i'm still standing up to the special interests and i am still standing and fighting for health care for every man  woman and child  when the republicans come after our nominee  and you know they will   now i personally believe they should be so embarrassed by the failed record of president bush that they should say they won't field a candidate  but i'm afraid they will   and so once again we know exactly what they will do  they'll throw everything they've got at whichever one of us is nominated  well  i've been through it  i've beaten it  i'm still standing and i will beat them again if i am your nominee  if you stand with me on tuesday  then come january  th    i will be standing on the steps of the capitol and i will be expressing for all of us our passionate commitment to this country and what it stands for  our belief that we may have been on a detour from our destiny but we are back on the right track and that with all of us together we can turn this country around  we are a nation of idealists  holding fast to our deepest values  that we are all created equal  that this generation of americans is destined for greatness  that every child deserves to fulfill his or her god given potential  it's the ideal that is inscribed on the base of the statue of liberty  the words that give voice to america's embrace   give me your tired  your poor  your huddled masse yearning to breath free  lady liberty has overlooked the new york harbor through wars and depression and the dark  dark day of september  th   a constant reminder that here in america we face our challenges and we embrace all of our people  so tonight  let us say with one voice   give us the child who wants to learn  give us the people in need of work  give us the veterans who need our care  give us this economy to rebuild and this war to end  give us this nation to heal  this world to lead  this moment to seize  i know that the people of wisconsin and america are ready to meet that challenge  thank you all very  very much and god bless you "], ["clinton", "thank you  thank you  it's great to be back here at penn and in philadelphia  i remember giving the commencement address here some years ago and i always had that image of the beauty of this campus and  of course  its extraordinary reputation  and i'm delighted to have a chance to be here with you to talk about an issue that is critical not only to pennsylvania but to our country  i want to thank congresswoman schwartz  she and i will be together later this afternoon  i'm looking forward to that very much  mayor nutter  i have heard the governor say that you could be the second best mayor in philadelphia history  i know you're aiming for first  so keep it up  you're doing a great job  and governor rendell who has been so visionary and strategic in his leadership first to philadelphia  then of course to pennsylvania  and what he just said about how he and his administration responded to the first signs of trouble from the mortgage market is just typical of ed rendell  he really is someone who is always looking to solve problems and that's why he's been so successful and why i'm so grateful for his support  i want to take a moment to note yesterday's heartbreaking news that five years after the start of the war there have now been   u s  military deaths in iraq  tens of thousands of our brave men and women have also suffered serious wounds  both visible and invisible  to their bodies  their minds  and their hearts  as president  i intend to honor their extraordinary service and the sacrifice of them and their families by ending this war and bringing them home as quickly and responsibly as possible  as the headlines of the past months have made clear  we are experiencing a crisis of confidence in our country  we have a crisis of confidence in our leadership with respect to iraq and we have a crisis of confidence in our economy  what started out as a subprime mortgage crisis has now become a national credit crisis  rippling out from banks and boardrooms to businesses and living rooms across america  we've had three straight months of private sector job losses  consumer confidence is down and falling  the dollar has hit record lows and gas prices  record highs  and last week the federal reserve took unprecedented measures to rescue wall street  the likes of which we haven't seen since the great depression  these are not just red flags or warning signs   they are indisputable indicators that our economy is in serious trouble  and now we face an urgent question  how do we keep today's turmoil from spiraling into a long and painful recession  this is no easy task  the  st century american economy is more complex and more interconnect with the global economy than ever before  it is shaped each day by billions and billions of individual transactions and interactions on every continent  subject to crises or even just speculation in one country can move markets in dozens of others with the blink of an eye or a flick of a mouse  in today's economy  trouble that starts on wall street often ends up on main street  sometimes within minutes  sometimes over the course of months or even years  when there's a run on mortgage backed securities and the bottom falls out for investment banks  the bottom falls out for families who see the value of their homes  their greatest source of wealth  decline  when our credit markets freeze up  that doesn't just cause panic on our trading floors  but in small businesses that can't get the capital they need to survive  and on college campuses like this one  when the student loan for next semester falls through  when we continue to persist in brain dead energy policy as confidence in our currency erodes  that means gas prices so high you feel like it costs more to commute to work than you make when you get there  it means rising food prices that strain household budgets  it means having less left over for savings or ever dipping into savings to make ends meet  it means more challenges for the mayor because property tax revenues drop  businesses don't have the same ability to make that profit that benefits the city  it means more problems for the governor who has to look across a complex state economy trying to figure out how to keep what has been a remarkable string of real budget balances and surpluses  it causes problems for our country  ultimately the true currency of today's american economy is confidence  when people lose confidence in the economy and our president's ability to manage it  problems become crises and crises lead to more crises  so we need a president who can restore our confidence  a president who is ready to confront complex economic problems with comprehensive solutions  a president who will act at the first signs of trouble  working with experts to identify the problem  with agencies to adapt regulations  with congress to pass necessary legislation  working to prevent crises rather than just reacting too little too late  we need a president who is ready on day one to be commander in chief of our economy  if you give me the chance  i will be that president  i will start by facing our economic situation as it is  not as we wish it would be  that means acknowledging that our economic crisis is  at its core  a housing crisis  a crises caused in part by unscrupulous mortgage lenders and brokers and unregulated transactions in mortgage backed securities  in part by speculators who were buying multiple houses to sell for a quick buck and other buyers who didn't act responsibly  and in part by a president and administration who failed to anticipate and continue to downplay the problems we face  unlike what happened here in pennsylvania  when governor rendell started seeing problems   and i remember those articles we had in the newspaper  governor  where the housing supply was being  you know  expanded and people were putting zero money down and they were trying to once again get the american dream  they were commuting sometimes two hours to be able to afford that house  well  those warning signals went unheeded in washington  but thankfully  not in harrisburg  and what we have to do now is to look at our housing crisis in greater detail  and i'd like to outline my plans to address it    million foreclosure notices went out last year   up   from   communities of color have been especially hard hit  subprime loans are five times more common in predominantly african american neighborhoods than predominantly white ones  and   of loans to hispanics are subprime compared to only   to whites  but this crisis isn't just about the more than   million households at risk of losing their homes and  of course    million foreclosure notices means many more people than that because obviously you have homes where anywhere from two to ten people live  it's about the tens of millions of families who have lost value in their homes  when i talk about the home foreclosure crisis  sometimes people  i can tell  look at me a little skeptically because they  i can tell  they're thinking to themselves  i didn't buy one of those mortgages  i don't have an arm  i'm not at risk  but  in fact  that is just not the case  home prices dropped almost   last quarter  home prices for everyone  if you have paid off your home  if you have a fixed rate mortgage with a manageable interest rate  you have suffered the steepest decline on record  that means families have lost at least   trillion in housing wealth so far  nearly two thirds of the size of the entire united states government budget  and today  nearly   million families are struggling with mortgages that are under water  they actually owe more for their mortgages than their homes are worth  so what was once their biggest financial asset is now a financial liability  the housing crisis is also a crisis for our cities  our towns and our neighborhoods  at least   million homes will lose value because of foreclosures in their neighborhoods  including   million homes right here in pennsylvania  abandoned homes and boarded up neighborhoods mean higher crime rates  lower property values  and plummeting tax receipts for cities and towns across america  now  a year ago in march   i called for immediate action to address abuses in the subprime market  and i laid out detailed concrete proposals for how to do so  i warned this administration that the problems in subprime mortgages would soon spill over into regular mortgages  the response from our president  well  his treasury secretary told congress that the problem was  quote   contained  and president himself assured us there would be a  quote   soft landing for the housing market  the housing crisis then spread from subprime to traditional mortgages  and in august of last year  i warned the administration that the housing mortgage crisis would soon ripple out throughout the entire economy  again  i called for immediate action and laid out concrete proposals to prevent foreclosures and help states hard hit by this crisis  i also called for tighter regulation of the housing market  starting with unscrupulous mortgage brokers who were taking advantage of our families  i would require mortgage brokers to disclose right up front that they're paid based on the size of the mortgage they sell  to put buyers on notice  i would work with states to develop strong  meaningful broker licensing standards to screen brokers and govern their conduct and i would require all brokers to register with the federal government so that home buyers can do their own background checks to ensure they're dealing with someone who will deal fairly with them  i also called for greater regulation of mortgage lenders  i would eliminate the prepayment penalties that lead to such high rates of default  i would require lenders to take into account the borrower's ability to pay property taxes and insurance fees when deciding whether to make a loan in the first place  too many loan lenders haven't made that part of the calculation and too many families don't know that they need to budget for these expenses  in october  i proposed legislation  the foreclosure rescue fraud act  that imposed new criminal penalties on lenders who were taking advantage of people  offering foreclosure rescue schemes that lure families in  take their money and do nothing to help them  i've also proposed that we amend the bankruptcy code to give judges the discretion to write down the value of struggling families' homes  believe it or not  bankruptcy judges can write down the value of many other things to help families pay off their debt  but not their homes  they can write off the value or write down the value of second homes  which seems kind of ironic to me  making this amendment to the code will help families in bankruptcy pay off their mortgages and stay in their homes  now  the response to all of this from the administration  well  they continued their wait and don't see approach  largely ignoring the mounting problems  by december of last year the mortgage crisis had become a national credit crisis  so i went to new york city and i told wall street they needed to do their part to address this crisis  i put forward an aggressive plan for a  day moratorium on all subprime foreclosures and a voluntary five year freeze on interest rates for all subprime mortgages  the response from this administration  a plan that let banks off the hook and left homeowners to fend for themselves  in the words of one expert  the president's plan was the bank lobby's dream  this administration's top economic priority it seems has been to lavish roughly   billion in tax cut on the wealthiest   of americans while families have lost nearly five times that in the value of their homes  last week when it became clear wall street was on the brink of a financial melt down  the fed and the administration sprang into action  the fed extended a   billion lifeline to prevent bear stearns from imploding and took unprecedented action to provide tens of billions of dollars in credit for other struggling investment banks as well  homeowners  on the other hand  have received next to no assistance  well  let's be clear  when families are losing their homes  that's also a financial crisis  when people's greatest source of wealth is losing its worth  as college costs and health care costs and food and gas prices shoot up  that's a financial crisis too  when  for sale  signs line streets across our country  when cities and towns are struggling with the costs of foreclosed properties  that is also a financial crisis  our families are feeling the anxiety right now  i hear their stories every day  from florida to wisconsin  from california and nevada to pennsylvania  last month  a little girl stood up at a town hall i was holding and asked me what i was going to do  about people and children that don't have any food or houses  i started to commend her on her concern for those less fortunate  when she interrupted me and said   i'm losing my home  her mother is a hair dresser whose customers are tightening their belts  they're not coming in as often  they're not having as much done  they had an adjustable rate mortgage they could no longer afford  we've come together today in the city where the american ideals of  life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness    of justice and equality   were inscribed into our founding documents  but what does all that mean to a family that's lost its nest egg and the hopes and dreams that went with it  what does it mean to a little girl who goes to sleep at night worried about losing her home  our housing crisis is at heart an american dream crisis  your home isn't just your greatest asset  your greatest source of wealth   it's your greatest source of security  it's what anchors you to your neighborhood and community  it's the center of your family  for the past seven years  we've had a president who stands up for the special interests   for the insurance companies and the mortgage companies and wall street  now it's time for a president who stands up for american families  a president who will rein in the special interests and rebuild the american middle class  over the past week  we've seen unprecedented action to maintain confidence in our credit markets and head off a crisis for wall street banks  it's now time for equally aggressive action to help families avoid foreclosure and to keep communities across our country from spiraling into recession  today  i am announcing my four part plan to protect american homeowners  a plan to help our families keep their homes and help communities hard hit by the housing crisis  my plan starts with an aggressive new effort to help millions of at risk families restructure their mortgages and stay in their homes  of the tens of millions of americans who have lost value in their homes    million are struggling with these mortgages underwater  that is more than   percent of all homeowners   the highest percentage since the great depression  if home prices fall another   percent  one third of all homeowners will find themselves in the same boat  the time for action is now   not a month from now  or a year from now   but now  and the reality is that many of our families need more than just basic refinancing  that's why i support new legislation proposed by my colleagues  representative barney frank and senator chris dodd that would expand the government's capacity to stand behind mortgages that are reworked on affordable terms  currently  families apply to the government  and the government decides on an individual basis whether to work with them to restructure their mortgages  you heard the governor say that maybe there will be   families that will be helped in pennsylvania  this is a slow process that helps relatively few families  and it simply isn't enough to revive our housing market  the frank dodd legislation would move beyond this incremental approach by setting up an auction system for mortgage companies that hold hundreds of thousands of these mortgages  through this system  these companies could sell mortgages in bulk to banks and other buyers  the buyers would be willing to purchase these mortgages   and restructure them to make them affordable for families   because they know the government will guarantee them once they are refinanced  this would be good for families  who can keep their homes  it would be good for mortgage lenders  because it's more profitable than foreclosures  it would be good for our economy  helping to unfreeze our credit markets  but given the severity of today's housing crisis  simply facilitating this auction process might not be enough to get our economy moving again  that's why i believe the federal housing administration should also stand ready to be a temporary buyer   to purchase  restructure  and resell underwater mortgages  just as it has in the past  this kind of temporary measure by the government could give our economy the boost it needs and families the help they certainly need  it would not require a single new federal bureaucracy  it would be designed to be self financing over time   so it would cost taxpayers nothing in the long run  it is a sensible way for everyone   lenders  investors  mortgage companies and borrowers   to share responsibility  keep families in their homes  stabilize communities and the economy  in order to determine whether the approach outlined by representative frank and senator dodd is sufficient   or whether we need the government to step in as a purchaser   i am calling on president bush to appoint an emergency working group on foreclosures  that is the second part of my plan  we simply cannot wait until congress passes legislation to find the best way to help millions of families  that's why i'm proposing an emergency working group on foreclosures  it could be led by a distinguished  non partisan group of economic leaders like alan greenspan  robert rubin  paul volcker  it's the kind of proactive step that would help re establish confidence in our economy by showing that the president and the administration was taking our economic crisis seriously  i've been calling for several weeks for the president to show some sense of urgency  the group's first order of business would be to determine how the government should implement the solutions proposed in the frank dodd legislation   and whether this legislation goes far enough  if it's decided additional steps are needed  then we should investigate whether   and how   the federal housing administration or other government entities  or fannie mae and freddie mac  could buy  restructure and resell underwater mortgages  the group would report back to congress on a very tight timeline   no more than three weeks  in the meantime  while the emergency working group is being formed  we should implement the moratorium on foreclosures that i first called for in december  every unnecessary home foreclosure just worsens the credit crisis and further depresses housing prices  secretary paulson and others have finally acknowledged the need for this moratorium in certain cases  i hope we will act to implement it as quickly as possible to implement it  the third part of my plan is a new housing stimulus package to provide   billion directly to states and localities  like pennsylvania and philadelphia  hard hit by this crisis  right now  concentrated clusters of foreclosures are devastating some communities  a recent study of ten states by the u s  conference of mayors found that the foreclosure crisis will lead to   billion dollars in lost tax revenues in just those ten states alone  just over a month ago  congress passed  and president bush signed  a   billion stimulus package  but this package did next to nothing to help homeowners and communities struggling with foreclosures  i said at the time  if we did not address the housing crisis  we would not be able to stem the bleeding  congress is trying to combat a recession caused by the housing crisis without doing anything to address that crisis  well  if the fed can extend   billion to help bear stearns address their financial crisis  the federal government should provide at least that much emergency assistance to help families and communities address theirs  that's why i'm calling for the creation of a one time emergency   billion fund that would go directly to cities and states to address the housing crisis  this money could be used to purchase foreclosed or distressed properties  which cities and states could then resell to low income families or convert into affordable rental housing  it could be used to help neighborhoods with high foreclosure rates avoid increased crime and blight by investing in everything from police and fire support to graffiti removal and better lighting  it could also be used by local agencies to provide counseling and refinancing to help families avoid foreclosure in the first place  governor rendell has been leading the way with programs like that here in pennsylvania  the pennsylvania homeowners emergency mortgage assistance program offers small  low cost loans to families facing foreclosure  it has saved up to   homes since it started  and this past october  governor rendell launched two additional programs to help homeowners refinance and restructure their mortgages  and we're seeing results here in pennsylvania  since the end of   pennsylvania's foreclosure rate has decreased   percent  i look forward to working with governors like governor rendell and with mayors like mayor nutter  who is already providing such outstanding leadership here in philadelphia  to replicate this kind of success across america  the fourth and final part of my plan involves passing new legislation to clarify legal liability for mortgage companies that act to help more borrowers stay in their homes  right now  many mortgage companies are reluctant to help families restructure their mortgages because they're afraid of being sued by the investment banks  the private equity firms and others who actually own the mortgage papers  because remember  all of these mortgages were bundled up in these huge packages and sold around the world  so you can't just go down to see your mortgage broker or your bank or your other lender to work out a deal because they no longer own the paper  this is the case even though writing down the value of a mortgage is often more profitable than foreclosing   both for mortgage companies and for most of those who own the mortgages  that's why i will be proposing legislation when congress returns to provide mortgage companies with protection against the threat of such lawsuits  i know this kind of policy isn't particularly glamorous and it probably won't make headlines  but it will make a critical difference in helping families save their homes and getting our economy back on track  now  some may claim that the plan i've outlined today is a  bailout  they'll argue that it's not government's role to help  well  that is the same kind of tired rhetoric we've been hearing for years now  and i think the american people know better  we've had enough of that old ideology  we're ready for solutions here and now  and to those who object to our government helping middle class families and low income families devastated by the housing crisis  i say this  we've given bear stearns a   billion lifeline  we've given their creditors  their lenders their customers and those associated with them the same lifeline  we are now lending billions of dollars a day to help wall street banks that aren't regulated  that are not held accountable  how can you tell a family about to lose their home that there's nothing we can do to help them  how can you tell them that if they had failed spectacularly we would've helped them but because they are failing quietly  desperately  we are turning our backs  how can you tell them that there is nothing we can do to rebuild the american dream  i have been across our country for years  i know how much a home means to all of us  i remember like it was yesterday when bill bought our first home  it was back in   and we were living in arkansas and teaching at the university there in the law school  we weren't yet married   though not for lack of asking on bill's part  and one day  we drove by this tiny red brick house with a  for sale  sign in front  all i said was i thought it was a sweet looking house and never thought about it again  several weeks later  bill said to me   do you remember that house you liked  i had never been inside  i had never been outside looking inside  i had just driven by  i said   what house that i liked  he said   you know  that red brick house on california drive  well  i bought it  so now you'd better marry me  because i can't live in it by myself  it wasn't exactly a mansion  the kitchen needed a lot of work  but i did say yes  and that fall  we were married in the living room of that house  surrounded by our closest friends and family  that first home meant the world to us  it was where we started our life together  celebrated birthdays  anniversaries and holidays with our friends  and families across america feel the same way  whether it is your first house or your tenth house  it is part of who we are as americans to look at that home ownership as such an important part of the american dream  today  we face unprecedented economic challenges  but we also have within our reach unprecedented economic opportunities  we've got clean energy opportunities that we are not exploiting  utilities are changing the way they do business  focusing on efficiency  not just producing energy  renewables like wind and solar are the most exciting prospects for american manufacturing in decades  i've even proposed that we establish a  carbon reduction mortgage association  or a  connie mae    an idea that vice president gore first came up with  we'd direct fannie mae and freddie mac to provide loans to help people build more and retrofit more energy efficient homes  we'd save money over the long run  we'd create millions of  green collar  jobs  we've got infrastructure opportunities to rebuild our crumbling roads  bridges and highways  like i  right here in philadelphia  opportunities to revolutionize our public transportation systems  cut down on traffic and pollution  we can do so much that will really build the strong economy we need in the  st century  but we won't do it by just waiting and watching and losing the opportunity to act  we've got so many great ideas that will give us the tools we need for the  st century  now  turning the economy around won't be easy  but we are gathered in the very city where our founders put to paper the words that have guided our nation   and inspired the world   for more than two hundred years  each generation of americans has faced threats to our ideals  each generation has met them  we have fought wars  overcome a recession  weathered all kinds of problems  lived through the great depression  we've had market crises of all kinds  through it all  as president franklin roosevelt once said   we have always held to the hope  the belief  the conviction that there is a better life  a better world  beyond the horizon  but we have to translate that hope into reality  we have to translate that conviction into solutions  and if we do  we will meet the current challenges with confidence and optimism  we will rebuild our economy   stronger  more vibrant  more resilient than ever before  it is a question of leadership  i hope we don't have to wait until the next president is sworn in  but that we will come together and exercise that leadership in both the public and the private sector as soon as possible  that's why i've set forth this plan and hope that the administration will begin to act with the urgency that the crisis before us demands  thank you all very much "], ["clinton", " p i hillary clinton delivered the following remarks at a  get out the vote  event today in wake forest  nc p i span td tr tr table link meta tr table td   someone running for office  particularly running for the presidency  has to be able to deal with both the immediate  the urgent  the long term and necessary   what i have tried to do in this campaign is to keep us focused on how we have to plan for the future  be prepared to deal with the economy  with energy  education  health care  our standing and position in the world  but also to deal with the date to day  because i have seen very personally the challenges that our families are facing now   these prices that are going up from gases  gas prices  to grocery prices  are really taking a big chunk out of people's disposable income  i think that it's imperative that we try to obtain some immediate relief  and what i have proposed would do just that   and there's a big disagreement in this campaign  you'll see it in the headlines about where both senator obama and i stand in taking on the immediate crisis that we confront   you've probably heard the debate about the gas tax  because my opponent is running ads and holding press conferences attacking my plan to try to give you some kind of break this summer   now  it's important to me that we come up with solutions  and in a campaign  sometimes that's hard  because of the back and forth in the campaign  but it is important  too  for you to see clearly what it is i propose and what i would do  there is no contradiction between trying to provide immediate relief and having a long term vision and a plan for what we must do to lessen our dependence on foreign oil  and to be moving towards more home grown fuels   so here is what i propose  i want the oil companies to pay the federal gas tax this summer  now  some people say  well  that wouldn't save the average consumer all that much money  well  we figure we'd save about   for the average consumer  it would save a whole lot more for truck drivers  for farmers  for people who commute long distances to work  who rely upon transporting the goods they sell for their business  and it would probably save truckers   billion in fuel costs  just for the summer  and that's   billion that wouldn't go into the cost of the food that you go to the grocery store to buy   i also believe that we should make it clear that there is something not right about the way these prices are going up  and i would ask the department of justice and the federal trade commission to conduct an investigation to try to get to the bottom of this   and here's why i believe this  and why i am urging the president and the congress to really take this seriously  there was testimony by an oil company executive just a few weeks ago in congress  when he was pressed  he admitted that probably if it were just market forces  the price of oil would be less than   a barrel  well  we know its   a barrel  another investigation in the senate found that there's about a   premium on the cost of oil  because of market manipulation by energy traders   now  we remember energy traders  back during enron  energy traders deliberately drove up the price of electricity on the west coast  i am convinced energy traders are driving up the cost of oil and gas right now in the global marketplace  and we need to close what is unfortunately called the enron loophole  and start regulating energy traders again so that they cannot be basically taking advantage of the rest of us   i also believe we should quit buying oil on the market to put in the strategic petroleum reserve  the president of the united states runs the strategic petroleum reserve  the point of it is to have a huge reserve of oil in case of some terrible disaster  it is   full  we can very well stop paying for it at these high prices which drives the price up for everybody else  and i would even release some of it to send a message to the oil companies and the oil producing countries that we're going to be serious going forward   i think if you are a leader  you have got to look at both the headlines and the trendlines  you'll have in me a president who gets up every single day and worries about what is going on here in wake forest  i believe completely that there isn't a problem we can't solve in america if we start acting like americans  and that requires us to have a president who is going to summon us to action again   this issue that we are facing today over gas prices  and the debate that my opponent and i are having over it  is really part of a larger difference between us  it's something i hope you will think about when you go to vote   either voting early today or voting next tuesday hr noshade noshade  size "]]
