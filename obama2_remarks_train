president i  i love you back  let me first of all say that orlando makes me feel real small  i mean  i want him blocking for me every time   i laughter i  so you know been a big fan of yours for a long time  i know how proud your hometown is of you  and we are thrilled to have you here today  just a the only other person i want to make mention of  who's just done so much work on behalf of the people of ohio  your former governor  my cochair for the campaign here in ohio  ted strickland is in the house  now  first of all  i just want to wish everybody a happy fourth of july  i hope everybody had a wonderful time fireworks  hotdogs  i don't know who did the grilling here   i audience member i   i inaudible i   i the president i  huh  are you a pretty good griller   i audience member i  yes   i the president i  yes   i laughter i  some of you know that yesterday was also malia's birthday  she is now   years old  going into high school  it used to be that i could tell her all the fireworks were for her  she doesn't believe me anymore  but she is doing great  and her and michelle and sasha all say hi  bo says hi  usually  they join us on these bus trips  but since it was malia's birthday  now she's got the whole sleepover thing and she loves me still  but she'd rather be hanging out with her friends  but i am thrilled to be here  it is wonderful to be in sandusky  wonderful to be in ohio  and it's wonderful just to be back out and about  i mean  washington's a beautiful place  and they give me a very nice rental housing there   i laughter i  but when you get a chance to get out and talk to folks  it reminds me of my first campaign  i'm now on my last campaign  but i still   i audience member i  four more years   i the president i i still remember when i was first running for the state senate in illinois  and a lot of people thought  why do you want to do something like that  and i tried to explain to people my motivation and by the way  in illinois  when you're a state legislator  you don't get paid a lot of money and you have to travel down to springfield  which is   hours' drive away  but the reason i told folks that i did it was because i thought back to my own life  i thought back to the fact that my grandparents participated in world war ii  my grandfather fought in patton's army  and my grandmother  she was rosie the riveter  she worked on a bomber assembly line  and when they got when my grandfather got back from the war and my mother had just been born  he was able to get a college education on the gi bill  and they were able to buy their first house with the help of the fha  and then i was raised by a single mom and the help of my grandparents  but despite the fact that we never had a lot of money  they were able to send me to a great school and i was able to get a wonderful education  and i met this beautiful woman  who  just because i was persistent  finally gave up and gave in and decided to marry me  but the reason that she was able to get a great education because her michelle's dad was he worked as what was called a stationary engineer  he was a blue collar worker  worked at a pumping station in chicago  and her mom stayed at home  looking after her and her brother  and then worked as a secretary  but somehow  her and her brother were able to get a great education  and so our family story was all about this basic idea in america that if you work hard  you can make it if you try  here in this country  that it doesn't matter what you look like  it doesn't matter where you come from  you don't have to be born into wealth  you don't have to be born into fame  if you're willing to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard  then the basic bargain in this country is you can find a job that pays a decent wage  and you should be able to buy a home  and you should be able to retire with dignity and respect and not go bankrupt because you get sick  and maybe take a vacation once in a while nothing fancy  but be able to spend time with your family  and most of all  you should believe that your kids are going to be able to do even better than you do  and that idea  that basic bargain  is what brought me to politics  because what i realized was that all the opportunities that i had been getting  there were too many young people out there who weren't getting those same opportunities  folks who were working just as hard as my grandparents or my parents did  that they were finding themselves making less money working harder  while the cost of health care or the cost of college or the cost of groceries were going up  and so my belief was that i had to participate and fight on behalf of the middle class that had given me so much  so that the next generation would be able to have those same opportunities  that's what motivated me in my first campaign  and as i traveled all across illinois to a lot of towns like sandusky  i'd meet people everywhere and it didn't matter where they came from  what their backgrounds were  they had the same kind of story to tell about how their family had succeeded in getting that piece of the american dream  and it's what knit us together  regardless of race  regardless of status  regardless of religion that idea  that's what pulled us together  that's what got me into my first campaign  and it's that same idea that i believe in  in my last campaign  it's the reason i'm here today  it's the reason i ran for president  it's the reason that i'm running again for president  because i want to keep on fighting for families all across america so they have the same opportunities that i did   i audience members   i four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  let me say  in   when i started running  we could already see that this american dream  this basic bargain was slipping away for too many people  but what we didn't realize at the time was we were going to get hit by the worst economic crisis in most of our lifetimes  and we've had to spend   years recovering and pushing back  so when folks said  let's go ahead and let the auto industry go bankrupt  we said  no  let's bet on american workers  let's bet on american industries  and now gm is back on top and chrysler's moving and ford is going strong  manufacturing starting to come back here in ohio and all across the country  some of the biggest manufacturing job growth since the  s  a lot of folks lost their jobs  but a lot of folks have retrained  and now they're going back and getting jobs in renewable energy and industries of the future  but for all the progress we've made  we've still got a long way to go  there's still too many folks probably here in sandusky who are out of work  a lot of people all across the country whose homes are still out of water underwater and lost a lot of value when the housing bubble burst  and here's the thing  ohio  it's not enough just to recover and get back to where we were before the crisis  we've still got to address this basic challenge of how do we build a strong middle class and make sure that the next generation has the same opportunities that we did  and that's a long term project  it's not going to happen overnight  but we've got to start working on it right now  we've got to move on that right now  that's the challenge we face  it's the central question of this election  now  we've got two fundamentally different visions in this election  mr  romney and his republican allies in congress  some of those special interests that support him  their basic vision says if we just cut taxes by about   trillion  especially for the wealthiest americans and we eliminate all these regulations that we put in place for example  to prevent another taxpayer funded bailout that somehow wealthy investors will benefit and it will all trickle down and everybody here will do better  that's their basic theory  that's their economic plan  i'm not exaggerating  you it's on their web site  and by the way  that   trillion tax cut that they want to provide  on top of the bush tax cuts  they pay for it by cutting education and cutting transportation funding and cutting basic research into things like alzheimer's and cancer  cutting job training programs  turning medicare into a voucher program  slashing medicaid  that's their economic theory  now  here's the problem  we tried that  we tried it before i came into office  not only did it not work  it led to the worst financial crisis that we've had in our lifetimes  why would we want to go back to something that didn't work  so we don't want to go backwards  and we've got a different vision  it's a vision that says  you know what  government can't solve every problem  one of the things that i learned from my mom was  you can't replace a mother who loves you and instills you with a sense of purpose and occasionally gets on you when you're not doing your homework  so government can't replace parents  but when i first got my job as an organizer for the catholic churches in chicago  working with parishes in low income neighborhoods  they taught me that no government program can replace good neighbors and people who care deeply about their communities who are fighting on their behalf  so i don't believe the government can solve every problem  and i don't think it should even try  i don't i think you can't help folks if they don't want to help themselves  america wasn't built on handouts  it was built on responsibility  and we have to challenge everybody to take individual responsibility in their own lives  but what we also understand and everybody here has an experience in their lives that underscores this what we also understand is there's some things that we do together that makes all of us stronger  that makes all of us richer  if we invest in good schools and our kids are getting great education  that's not just good for those kids  that's good for all of us  if we put construction workers to work rebuilding roads and bridges  high speed rail  broadband lines  that's not just good for those workers  that creates a platform for everybody to benefit  everybody to succeed  when we invest in basic research that helps invent the internet or gps  that gives businesses an opportunity then to come in and take that new knowledge and create new businesses and create jobs for everybody  that's good for all of us  so my vision says  you know what  there are some things we have to do together  and i'm running for a second term as president because we have more to do  i'm running because i want to make sure that every child gets a high quality education  and that means i want to hire new teachers in our classrooms  especially in math and science  and i want to give   million more people the opportunity to get trained at a community college for jobs that exist right now and get the skills they need  and i want to make college more affordable for every young person who has the initiative and drive to go  and make sure they're not burdened by thousands of dollars' worth of debt  that's why i'm running for president  i'm running for president to make sure that america builds again  that we make stuff  i told you manufacturing is starting to come back  but we can do so much more  right now we've got tax laws that give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in sandusky  right here in the ohio  right here in the united states of america  i'm running because i do want to rebuild our roads and our bridges  we've got hundreds of thousands of construction workers all across the country who are out of work  and all the manufacturing that goes into construction  we could rebuild our roads  our bridges  our schools  renovate our buildings so that they're more energy efficient  put a lot of people back to work  and that's good for the entire economy  that means more folks who are eating at restaurants  that means more folks are out shopping because they've got money in their pockets  and that benefits all of us  i'm running because i want to make sure  now that we've ended the war in iraq and we're winding down the war in afghanistan  that we are providing opportunities for every veteran  because they shouldn't have to fight for a job when they come home  and i want to take half of that money to help reduce our debt  and i want to take the other half that we were spending on war to rebuild america  we need to do some nation building right here at home  that's why i'm running  i'm running because the health care law that we passed was the right thing to do  because if you already have health insurance  insurance companies can't drop you now because you had a because you're sick or because you suddenly reached some lifetime limit  and young people now are able to stay on their health insurance your health insurance until they're   years old  and senior citizens are getting more discounts on their prescription drugs  and people who have preexisting conditions are going to be able to get health insurance for the first time  and you know what  we fought so hard to make that happen  and now the supreme court has ruled  it is time for us to move forward  we don't need to reargue the last   years  i'm willing to work with anybody who wants to make it work  who wants to improve health care in this country and lower costs for individual families  but i don't want to just keep on having political arguments that are based on politics and not on facts  i'm running because i want to implement the wall street reform law  i don't want us to have to bail out wall street banks again  they've got to act responsibly  and we've got to make sure that the rules are in place so that they don't act recklessly  and i want to balance our budget  i want to reduce our deficit  deal with our debt  but i want to do it in a balanced  responsible way  it makes no sense for us to provide me a tax cut i don't need it and then to cut teachers from our public schools or to cut our aid to education or to cut student loans and make them more expensive for our young people  i have had opportunities  i want to now give something back  and i think a lot of successful people out there want to give something back  so we'll cut programs that don't work  and we'll keep eliminating waste that doesn't make that doesn't improve prospects for the middle class  but i'm not going to balance the budget on the backs of the poor or the disabled or the vulnerable or ask middle class families to pay higher taxes to pay for a tax cut for me or mr  romney  that's not how we're going to balance our budget  that's not how we're going to deal with our deficit  so all these things whether it's health care  whether it's bringing manufacturing jobs back  whether it's making sure our kids get a great education  whether it's making sure that we're rebuilding america and tapping into american energy so we're less dependent on foreign oil  whether we're taking care of our veterans all these things  they tie together  they go back to that first campaign i ran  because they have to do with making sure that what made this country great our big  diverse  hopeful  optimistic  hard working  patriotic middle class that we continue to grow that middle class for the future  that we continue to make folks who work hard a little more secure and we provide that basic american promise to the next generation  that's the essential project that got me into politics  that's why i ran for president  and that's what built this country  and i know that during the course of the next   months  you're going to see a whole bunch of negative ads  they're spending the other side's spending more money than any time in history  and every ad's basically the same  it basically says the economy is no good and it's obama's fault  they basically have just one line   i laughter i  and after a while  even if you don't buy that baloney  it can get discouraging  and after you start thinking  you know what  politics is just a dirty  nasty business  and it's not worth getting involved  and people get discouraged  and they get cynical  and you know what  that's what the other side is counting on  because when we get cynical and we don't participate  then the folks who are in power  the folks who have the special interest lobbies  the folks that are spending all this money  they're doing just fine  and so the thing that i want everybody here to understand each of you personally is that back in   everybody said we couldn't do it because we were outspent we weren't favored  when a guy named barack obama runs for president  that he is not the odds on favorite  that first race that i ran as a state senator  michelle and i  we're going around knocking on doors  passing out leaflets  nobody gave us a shot  everybody said  nobody can pronounce your name  how are you going to win   i laughter i  you don't come from a famous family  you don't we couldn't afford to advertise on tv  and yet what we learned was that when ordinary people come together when you believe in something so deeply that you're willing to talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors and talk to your coworkers  knock on doors and make phone calls when the american people decide what's right  then all that money doesn't matter  all the tv advertising doesn't matter  and that stalemate that we have in washington  where the other side is trying to block every single thing we do and say no to everything  the only people that can break that stalemate ultimately is going to be you  so i hope during the next     months  i hope you remember your family's story  i hope you remember your parents and how hard they worked or your grandparents or your great grandparents  maybe some of them immigrants coming to this country  not knowing what to expect  but understanding if they worked hard this was a chance where your dreams could happen  and i hope you think about what we have to do to make sure that that is passed on to the next generation  and i want you to know that when i ran in   i said i wasn't going to be a perfect man and i certainly wasn't going to be a perfect president  but i'd always tell you what i thought  i'd always tell you where i stood  and most of all  i would wake up every single day thinking about you  thinking about how to make your lives a little bit better  because in you i see my own life and everything that my parents and grandparents struggled for  and i have kept that promise  and i intend to keep that promise as long as i have the privilege of being your president  so if you're willing to stand with me and work with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls with me  i promise you we will finish what we started in   and we will remind the world just why it is that the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  thank you  everybody  god bless you  and god bless america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hey  hello  ohio  hello  it is good to be back in ohio  all right  well  everybody who's got a chair  feel free to sit down  just go ahead and relax  i know it's a little warm out here  but this is how summer is supposed to feel like  a couple of people i want to acknowledge  first of all  please give ina a big round of applause for the great introduction  we're proud of her  i am so pleased to see once again the outstanding mayor of maumee  tim wagener  there he is  one of the best senators in the country  your senator  sherrod brown  one of your outstanding members of the congressional delegation  marcy kaptur is here  and your former governor and my campaign cochair  ted strickland is in the house   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you  it's great to see you  i hope everybody had a wonderful fourth of july  we had we invited some people over for a barbecue i laughter i had a chance to say thank you to our incredible men and women in uniform  and we're so proud of them  and then it was malia's birthday yesterday  she is   years old i know  it happens too fast   i laughter i  don't even remind me  she's going into high school next year  which means that she's see  when she was small  i could say  all these fireworks i had arranged for her birthday   i laughter i  but she doesn't believe me anymore   i laughter i  now  unless you have been hiding out in the woods somewhere  you are aware of the fact that it's campaign season   i audience member i  we're fired up and ready to go   i the president i  you're fired up  it's campaign season again  look  i understand it's not always pretty to watch  there has been more money flooding into the system than we've ever seen before  more negative ads  more cynicism  most of what you read about or hear about on the news has to do with who is up or down in the polls  instead of what these issues actually mean for you and for america  so it can be frustrating  and i know sometimes it may be tempting to kind of turn away from all of it and just turn off the tv  tivo everything that you want to watch so you can skip over the commercials  it's easy sometimes  i think  to lose interest and lose heart when you hear what's going on in washington  and i'll be honest with you  i think there are some folks who are betting that you will lose interest  that are betting that somehow you're going to lose heart  but here you are in the heat  i'm betting you're not going to lose interest   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i'm betting you're not going to lose heart   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i still believe in you  i'm betting on you  and the country is betting on you  ohio  because you understand that  even though politics may seem real small right now and may seem real petty  the choice in this election could not be clearer  and it could not be bigger  the stakes could not be bigger   i audience member i  you can do it   i the president i  i know with you  what's going on in this election is bigger than just a choice between two candidates or between two parties  it's about two fundamentally different visions of where we go as a country  see  i believe in an america where no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  you can make it if you try  we've never been a country that we've never been a country looking for handouts  we're a nation of strivers and risk takers and entrepreneurs  workers  but what we ask for is that hard work pays off  that responsibility is rewarded  the idea is if you take responsibility for your life  if you put in the effort  if you do the responsible thing  then you can find a job that pays a living wage  that you can look after your family  that you can buy a home  that you can retire with some dignity and some respect  that you won't go bankrupt when you get sick  that you have that core  middle class security that built this country  and that you can pass that on to your kids so they can do things that you never even imagined  that's the essence of america  and i believe in that basic promise of america because i lived it  that's my biography  i had grandparents whose service at world war ii was rewarded by them having a chance to go to college and buying their first home  because i had a hard working mom who raised me and my sister right  but also had some help so that we could end up going to the best schools in the country even though we didn't have a lot of money  i got involved in politics  i ran for president in  and some of you joined me in  because we believed in that basic bargain that built the largest middle class in history and the strongest economy in the world  and we felt like that basic bargain was slipping away  that hard work wasn't always rewarded  that being responsible didn't always get you ahead  that folks who acted irresponsibly sometimes were making out like bandits while ordinary folks were having a tougher and tougher time  so we came together in that election democrats  but also independents and  yes  some republicans to restore that basic bargain that built this country  and we knew at the time it wouldn't be easy  we knew it would take more than one year or one term or maybe even one president  but what we didn't realize at the time was we were going to be hit by the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes  and that's been tough on a lot of folks  including people here in ohio  it robbed millions of people of their jobs and their homes and their savings  and it pushed the american dream even further from reach for a lot of people  but you know what  this crisis has not changed the fundamental character of america  it hasn't changed the fundamental character of this town  or this state  or this part of the country  we've still got people who are working hard  we've still got people who are acting responsibly  it hasn't diminished our belief in those ideals we were fighting for in   and our mission right now isn't just to recover from this economic crisis  although that's job one  our mission is to give back to america  to americans all across the country  what's been lost  that sense of security  our goal isn't just to put people back to work tomorrow  it's also to build for the long haul an economy where hard work pays off  an economy where everybody  whether you're starting a business or punching a clock  has confidence that if you work hard  you will get ahead  that's what america is about  that's what ohio is about  now  i got to tell you  what's holding us back is not   i audience member i  where is michelle   i the president i  where's michelle   i laughter i  look  i know i'm second fiddle i laughter i but i'll have michelle come back sometime  i'm just the warmup act  michelle says hi   i laughter i   i audience member i  we love you  mr  president   i the president i  thank you so much  i appreciate it  now  let me say this  what's holding us back from going ahead and meeting these challenges   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  what's holding us back from meeting our challenges  it's not a lack of ideas  it's not a lack of solutions  what's holding us back is we've got a stalemate in washington between these two visions of where the country needs to go  and this election is all about breaking that stalemate  the outcome of this election will determine our economic future not just for the next year or the next   years  but maybe for the next decade or the next two  and i want everybody to be clear about what this choice is  my opponent and his allies in congress  they believe prosperity comes from the top down  they believe if we eliminate most regulations and we cut taxes for the wealthy by trillions of dollars  that somehow our whole economy will benefit  and all of you will benefit  and there's going to be more jobs and better security for everybody  that's their basic economic plan  now  i think they're wrong about their vision  and part of the reason i think they're wrong is because we tried it  remember  just a while back   i audience member i  it didn't work   i the president   i and it didn't work  we're still paying for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that weren't paid for and didn't lead to better jobs or better wages for the middle class  the lack of regulation on wall street  the kind of thing that they're prescribing  that's exactly what allowed people to game the system that caused this whole mess in the first place  so no  i don't think that mr  romney's plan to spend trillions of dollars more on tax cuts for folks who don't need them and aren't even asking for them is the right way to grow our economy  especially since they want to pay for it by cutting education spending and cutting job training programs and raising middle class taxes   i audience members i  no   i the president i  and i sure don't agree with his plan to keep giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  i don't think we're better off by rolling back regulations on banks or insurance companies or oil companies   i audience members i  no   i the president   i regulations that are meant to protect workers and consumers and families and our economy  so we don't need more top down economics  we've tried it  it did not work  what we need is somebody who is out there fighting for the middle class and wants to grow the middle class  when the american auto industry was on the brink of collapse  and more than one million jobs were on the line  governor romney said we should just let detroit go bankrupt   i audience member i  that's what he said   i the president i  i refused to turn my back on communities like this one  i was betting on the american worker  and i was betting on american industry  and   years later  the american auto industry is coming roaring back  that chrysler plant up the road bringing on another   employees to make the cars that the world wants to buy  the wrangler built right here in toledo just set an alltime sales record  what's happening in toledo can happen in cities like cleveland  can happen in pittsburgh  it can happen in other industries  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president  because i'm going to make sure that it does  i want it happening all across this country   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  just like ina said  i want goods shipped around the world  stamped with  made in america  unlike my opponent  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  start rewarding companies that are investing right here in toledo  right here in ohio  right here in maumee  that's what i'm looking for   i audience member i  we are too   i the president i  governor romney's experience has been in owning companies that were called  pioneers  of outsourcing  that's not my phrase   pioneers  of outsourcing  my experience has been in saving the american auto industry  and as long as i'm president  that's what i'm going to be doing  waking up every single day thinking about how we can create more jobs for your families and more security for your communities  that's why my administration brought trade cases against china at a faster pace than the previous administration  and we've won those cases  just this morning  my administration took a new action to hold china accountable for unfair trade practices that harm american automakers  and let me tell you something  americans aren't afraid to compete  we believe in competition  i believe in trade  and i know this  americans and american workers build better products than anybody else  so as long as we're competing on a fair playing field instead of an unfair playing field  we'll do just fine  but we're going to make sure that competition is fair  that's what i believe  that's part of our vision for america  but that's not all it takes to rebuild this economy  i'm running to make sure that america once again leads the world in educating our kids and training our workers  our tuition tax credit has saved millions of families thousands of dollars each  and now i want to extend it  we won the fight in congress to stop congress from letting student loans double  and now we're working with colleges and universities to start bringing tuition costs down  i want our schools to hire and reward the best teachers especially in math and science  i want to give   million more americans the chance to go to community colleges and learn skills that local businesses are looking for right now  see  in the  st century  a higher education is not a luxury  it is an economic necessity for every single one of our young people and folks who are retraining to get the jobs of the future  and our veterans who are coming home  and we need to take care of all of them and give them those opportunities to work their way into the middle class  god bless you  thanks for your service   i audience member i  my pleasure  sir   i the president i  god bless you  freedom is not free  and you fought for it  i'm running to give more responsible homeowners the chance to refinance their mortgage and save   a year  we've got low interest rates right now  but a lot of folks are having trouble refinancing with their banks  we've said to congress  let's go ahead and help them refinance  because that extra three can you use an extra    i audience member i  yes   i the president i  and that means you're spending at restaurants and you're buying stuff at the store and you're buying some clothes  is that what you said   i laughter i  but you're putting that money back into circulation  that's good for everybody  it's good for small businesses  it's good for large businesses  we've already given thousands of families the chance to do this  my opponent  his plan for the housing market is to let it hit bottom   i audience member i  boo   i the president i  that's not a plan  that's a problem  that's not a solution  i'm running because i believe that in america  nobody should go bankrupt because they get sick  i'll work with anybody who wants to work with me to continue to improve our health care system and our health care laws  but the law i passed is here to stay  and let me tell you something  maumee  it is going to make the vast majority of americans more secure  we will not go back to the days when insurance companies could discriminate against people just because they were sick  we're not going to tell   million young people who are now on their parent's health insurance plans that suddenly they don't have health insurance  we're not going to allow medicare to be turned into a voucher system  now is not the time to spend   more years refighting battles we fought   years ago  now is the time to move forward and make sure that every american has affordable health insurance and that insurance companies are treating them fairly  that's what we fought for  that's what we're going to keep  we are moving forward   i audience member i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  and  maumee  i'm running because after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building here at home  we ended the war in iraq  we are transitioning out of afghanistan  my plan would take half the money that we've been spending on war  let's use it to put people back to work rebuilding our roads  rebuilding our bridges  rebuilding our schools  getting those construction workers out and about rebuilding america  that's how we build our future  we can't go backwards  we've got to move forward  i'm running to make sure that we can afford all this by paying down the debt in a balanced way  in a responsible way  keep in mind  we had a surplus last time there was a democratic president  they ran up the tab  put two wars on a credit card  tax cuts not paid for  prescription drug plan not paid for  left us the tab  well  we're going to clean it up  but we're going to clean it up not on the backs of the middle class  we're going to do it in a balanced and responsible way  i'll cut spending like we already have on things we can't afford and aren't helping people  but unlike my opponent  i'll ask the wealthiest americans who enjoyed the biggest tax cuts over the past decade to do a little more  and by the way  just like we know what they did didn't work  we know what i'm talking about did work  because what i'm talking about is what bill clinton did as president  our economy created   million new jobs  the biggest budget surplus in history  and by the way  we made a whole bunch of millionaires as well  it wasn't like rich people were doing bad back in the nineties  they were doing just fine  right   i audience member i  right   i the president i  and you know what  there are plenty of patriotic  successful americans who agree with us  they want to do the right thing because they care about this country  on jobs  on education  on housing  on health care  on retirement  on all these things that are the pillars of a middle class life  we can't go backwards  we've got to go forwards  and that's the choice facing us this november  and the choice could not be more clear  now  i'm not here to tell you  ohio  that this is going to be easy or it's going to be quick  changes that we're trying to bring about  we're dealing with problems that happened over the course of decades  they're not going to be changed overnight  and i know sometimes people feel like  well  obama  he's done some good things  but  boy  things are still tough out there  change hasn't happened fast enough  i understand that  i get frustrated too  but what we what's required are long term solutions  not slick promises  not quick fixes  and there are plenty of well funded special interests in washington  and their powerful allies in congress  who want to keep things just the way they are  but don't ever buy the line that they're selling that we can somehow accomplish more by doing less  that might benefit their interests  but it won't benefit yours  that's not how we became america  our parents  our grandparents  the founders of this country  they didn't set their sights lower  they didn't settle for something less  and neither do we  because we're americans  if we're going to be the country we know we can be  we've got to keep doing the hard work of building the future of this country for our kids  just like our parents and grandparents did for us  and let me tell you something  from now until november  the other side is going to spend more money than we've ever seen before  and they will be raining ads down on your head  and they'll tell you it's all my fault  i can't fix it because i think government is the answer to everything  or because i haven't made a lot of money in the private sector  or i think everything is doing just fine  that's what all the scary voices in the ads will tell you  that's what mitt romney will say  that's what republicans in congress will say  and that's their plan for winning an election  but it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to provide you with greater security for you and your family  it's not a plan to restore the middle class or restore the american dream  and that's the kind of plan we need right now  is a plan to build the middle class and restore the american dream  and if you agree with me if you believe that our economy works best when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules  then i'm going to need you out there working  and you know what  i need you to talk to your friends and your neighbors  don't just talk to democrats  talk to independents  talk to republicans  because i want to work with anybody who believes that we're in this together  i want to work with anybody who believes we've got to invest in our future  i want to work with anybody who thinks we've got to give our kids a great education  i want to work with anybody who believes that we've got to make sure that we're building things here in america  i'm not a democrat first  i'm an american first  i believe we rise or fall as one nation  as one people  and i believe what's stopping us is not our capacity to meet our challenges  what's stopping us is our politics  and that's something you have the power to solve  so hit the doors  make some phone calls  register your friends  talk to those family members who sometimes don't vote  remind them where america's strength comes from  it comes from our people  remind them how america came this far  it came because of our people  all this money that's being spent on negative ads in this campaign  they spent money in   i got outspent when i ran first time for senate  but you know what i have learned  when the american people  when ordinary folks start standing up for themselves  start making their voices heard  start coming together  start believing again  nothing can stop them  nothing can stop you  nothing can stop you  maumee  nothing can stop you  ohio  nothing can stop us  america  let's remind the world just why it is we live in the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  pittsburgh  it is good to be back in pittsburgh  pennsylvania  a couple of people i want to acknowledge  first of all  one of my favorite people  one of our finest united states senators  give it up for bob casey  i think we've got in the house as well your mayor  luke ravenstahl  congressman mike doyle is in the house  allegheny county executive rich fitzgerald is here  the pennsylvania democratic state party chair jim burn is here  and we want to thank sheryl sesay and monte reid for the preprogram  great job  great job  now  i first of all  before we do anything else   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  but let's also be clear that a very important situation has arisen  the white sox and the pirates are in first place  so we may be in the world series together  we love each other  we can root for each other until we get to the world series   i laughter i  then it's every man for himself   i laughter i  i know it's hot  i know you guys have been waiting a while  so i just so i want to  first of all  just say thank you to everybody for taking the time to be here   i audience members i  thank you   i the president i  i hope everybody had a great fourth of july  we had some folks over for a barbecue in my backyard i laughter i had some fireworks  it was also malia's birthday on the  th  she is now   years old  it goes by too quick  i used to be able to convince her that all these fireworks were for her  but she no longer believes me   i laughter i  but she sends her love  and michelle and sasha and bo all say hi  now  some of you may know that we've been on the bus tour for the last couple of days  i've been traveling through ohio  we came just came from beaver  pennsylvania  and everywhere i go  people have said  mr  president  you're getting too skinny  you need to eat   i laughter i  and so we've been eating a lot  and i've had a chance to talk to folks everywhere i go  and people are aware of the fact that we're now in full campaign swing  and i know that sometimes modern campaigns aren't pretty to watch  because basically  so much of it involves millions of dollars on television  most of the ads are negative  and at a certain point  people get discouraged and start feeling like nobody in washington's listening to what's going on to ordinary folks all across the country  but i've got to tell you  despite the cynicism and the negativism  what i'm what i think about is my first race  and what   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  what i think about is my first race  and this is when i was first running for state senate  i couldn't afford television commercials  and michelle and i  we used to go door to door and pass out flyers that we had printed out in kinko's  and we had our friends and our family members  and we'd march in fourth of july parades  and it was hard work  and i didn't have air force one back then   i laughter i  but when i think about my first race  i think about why i got into politics  and the reason i got into politics was because this country has blessed me so much  and i thought about my own family  how my grandfather fought in patton's army in world war ii while my grandmother was back home working on a bomber assembly line  and when my grandfather came back  he was able to go to college on the gi bill  and they were able to buy a home through the fha  and then i thought about my single mom because my dad left when i was very young and how  despite all the struggles  she was able to get a great education because that's the kind of country this was  and she was able to pass on a great education to me and my sister  and then i think about michelle's mom  and the fact that michelle's mom and dad  they didn't come from a wealthy family  michelle's dad  he worked a blue collar job at the sanitary plant in chicago  and my mother in law  she stayed at home until the kids got older  and she ended up becoming a secretary  and that's what she worked at most of her life  was a secretary at a bank  so none of us came from privileged backgrounds  none of us had a lot of wealth or fame  but what we understood was that here in america  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what church you worship at  no matter what region of the country  if you were willing to work hard  if you were willing to take responsibility for your life  you could make it if you try here in the united states of america  and that basic idea  that basic bargain that says here we all deserve a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same set of rules  that basic bargain that says if you're willing to work hard and take responsibility in your own life  then you can find a job that pays a living wage and you can save up and buy a home and you won't go bankrupt if you get sick  maybe you can take a vacation with your family once in a while  nothing fancy  but you can go out and go visit some of our national parks or i remember my favorite vacation when i was a kid  traveling with my mom and my grandma and my sister  and we traveled the country on greyhound buses and railroads  and once in a while  we'd rent a car not that often and stay at howard johnson's and i laughter i didn't matter how big the pool was  if there was a pool  i'd jump in   i laughter i  i was   years old  and i was excited just to go to the vending machine and get the ice bucket and get the ice  and then  the chance to retire with dignity and respect  that dream of a strong middle class  that's what america has always been about  that's what led me to get into public service  that's what led to my first campaign  was making sure that access to that middle class that growing  thriving heartbeat of america that that was available for everybody  that it wasn't just available for me and michelle  but it was available for every kid all across this country  and that's what led me to run for president of the united states  and that's what's led me to ask you for a second term as president of the united states  to fight for america's middle class and everybody who is trying to get into the middle class   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  that idea has been getting battered a little bit over the last decade  part of the reason i ran in   part of the reason so many of you came together to work on that campaign  was we had seen a decade in which those middle class dreams were under assault  folks were working harder  but making less  costs of everything from health care to college to groceries to gas kept on going up  but your salaries or your wages didn't  we had put two wars on a credit card  taken a surplus and turned it into a deficit  and all of it culminated in the worst financial crisis that we've seen in our lifetimes  so what we came together to do in   was start this process this painstaking  laborious process to turn this country back towards those core values  to turn this country back towards our best selves and our best ideals  and we knew we wouldn't be able to do it overnight because these problems weren't created overnight  but we believed in this country  and we believed in the american people  we understood that this has never been a country of folks looking for handouts  but what they do want is a fighting chance  and so for the last   years  when some folks said  let's let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  no   i the president i we said  no  we're betting on the american worker  we're betting on the american industries  and now gm is back at number one  and chrysler and ford are back  and we've started to see manufacturing come back to our shores  more manufacturing jobs created than any time since the  s  we saw people go back and get retrained for jobs  sometimes getting jobs of the future  advanced manufacturing  new technologies  and clean energy  we've seen small businesses who almost had to shutter their doors during the crisis  but sometimes the owners didn't take a salary because they wanted to keep their folks working  and somehow  inch by inch  yard by yard  mile by mile  they've been able to come all the way back and are now starting to hire workers again  over   million jobs created over the last   years  over   manufacturing jobs  so we've been fighting back  but what we all understand is that we've got so much more to do  too many of our friends and family members and neighbors are still out of work  too many folks still are seeing their home property values underwater  and so the question for all of you at this moment is  how will we determine our direction  not just for the next year  not just for the next   years  but for the next decade  the next two decades  because this election is not just about two candidates or two parties  it's about two fundamentally different visions of where we take america  and the stakes could not be higher  and ultimately  the way we're going to make this decision is you  there's a stalemate in washington right now because there are two different visions of how we have to move forward  and you've got to break that stalemate  so let me just very briefly tell you what the choices are  you've got mr  romney and his allies in congress   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and their basic vision is one that says we're going to give   trillion of new tax cuts on top of the bush tax cuts  most of them going to the wealthiest americans  they won't be paid for  or if they are paid for  they'll be paid for by slashing education funding   i audience members i  boo   i the president i or making college loans more expensive   i audience members i  boo   i the president i or eliminating support for basic science and research  the kind of work that's done right here at carnegie mellon   i audience members i  boo   i the president i or making medicare a voucher system   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  so that's one part of their plan  and the second part of their plan is  let's eliminate regulations  regulations that we just put in place to make sure that wall street doesn't act recklessly and we can prevent another taxpayer funded bailout when the financial system goes out of whack  regulations that protect our air or our water  regulations that protect consumers from being taken advantage of  and that's it  that's their economic plan  don't take my word for it  go on their web site  the republicans in congress voted for this plan  and you know what  it is a theory  it's an idea of how you might grow an economy if we hadn't just tried it for   years before i took office  we tried it  and it didn't work  so why would we want to go backwards to the same theory that didn't work before  they're banking on the notion that you don't remember what happened when they were in charge the last time they were in charge of the white house and how surpluses became deficits and how job growth was more sluggish than it's been in   years and how we ultimately ended up with the worst financial crisis since the great depression  well  pittsburgh  i want you to know i've got a different theory  i've got a different idea  and let me be honest  it's not a silver bullet  it's not going to change things completely in the next day or the next week  but it moves us in a direction that is true to our traditions by building not from the top down  but from the middle class out  it's a vision that says we don't need to just bring automaking back  we can bring manufacturing back to america  we can invest in advanced manufacturing research like is being done right here at carnegie mellon  and we can change our tax code to make sure  instead of giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give those tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in pittsburgh  right here in pennsylvania  right here in the united states of america  that's my vision for the future  my vision is one that says we've got to invest in our young people so they get the best education in the world  so i want to hire new teachers  especially in math and science  i want to keep on making college more affordable  we just prevented congress from doubling student interest loan rates because of you  but we've got to do more to bring tuition down and give   million more americans the chance to study at community colleges and get the job training they need for the jobs of the  st century  because a higher education is not an economic luxury  it is an economic necessity  and i'm committed to making sure everybody gets that chance for the skills and the trainings they need to succeed  my vision says we ended the war in iraq as i promised  and we're winding down the war in afghanistan  so let's take half of that money that we're saving in war and use it to pay down the deficit  let's take the other half and do some nation building here at home  let's put some americans back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges  our schools  let's build broadband lines and wireless networks and high speed rail  let's invest in the basic science and research that helped to send a man to the moon and create the internet  that's what makes america great  we are innovators and risk takers  i believe in an america in which we control our own energy future  we're producing more oil than we have in the last   years  we're importing less  but we can do so much more  we've got to bet on not just an oil industry that's already profitable  we got to bet on a clean energy industry of solar and wind that can create jobs and help our environment and free ourselves from dependence on foreign oil  and i've got a vision that believes that everybody  all families who are responsible  should be able to have the basic security of health care  the supreme court has spoken  the law we passed is here to stay  if you have health insurance  the only thing that changes for you is you're more secure because insurance companies can't drop you when you get sick  they don't have a lifetime limit where suddenly they're dumping the costs on you  even though you've been paying your premiums  we've got millions of young people who are able to stay on their parent's plan right now because of that health care law  we've got millions of seniors who are seeing cheaper prescription drugs  and if you don't have health insurance  we're going to help you get health insurance  i believe it was the right thing to do because that's part of making sure a middle class is thriving in this country  that they don't have to fear that when somebody in their family gets sick  that somehow they're going to lose everything they've worked for all those years  i make no apologies for it  it was the right thing to do  and we're going to keep moving forward  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  we're not going to go back to a vision that somehow thinks when a few wealthy investors do well  then everybody does well  so you know what  we need to deal with our deficit  we need to deal with our debt  and part of america's character is the understanding that government can't solve every problem  we don't expect it to  some folks can't be helped if they don't want to help themselves  not every government program works  we've already cut a trillion dollars in spending that wasn't helping families succeed  and we'll do some more  but you know what  we are not just going to cut and balance the budget on the backs of middle class families  asking them to pay more taxes  asking them to suddenly not get help when it comes to sending their kids to college  i think we can ask wealthiest americans to do a little bit more  we need to have a tax code where secretaries aren't paying a lower tax rate than their bosses  and you know what  the good news is there are a lot of americans all across the country very successful americans who agree with me on this  because they understand the only reason they succeeded was somebody helped them  didn't give them a handout  but gave them a hand up  this idea that we're all in it together  that we rise or fall as one people  that theory of mine about how to grow the economy  we've tried that too  we tried it as recently as when bill clinton was president  and you know what  we created   million new jobs  and we had a surplus at the end of it instead of a deficit  and we created a whole lot of wealth and a lot of millionaires along the way  because that formula that says we're in it together means that everybody can do well  the reason we built the hoover dam or the golden gate bridge  the reason we sent a man to the moon or invested in the research that resulted in the internet  the reason we built an interstate highway system  we did those things not for any individual to become rich  we did it so that all of us would have a platform for success  because we understand there are some things we do better together  i continue to believe that  i think most americans understand that  that's the reason i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  over the next   months  you're going to see more money spent than you've ever seen before  more negative ads  these guys are writing   million checks   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and you'll hear the same thing from them over and over again  because they know that their economic theory isn't going to sell  so all they've got to argue is   the economy is not moving as fast as it needs to  jobs aren't growing as fast as they need to  and it's all obama's fault  that's basically their only message   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  i guess this is a plan to win an election  but it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to grow our middle class  and you know what  i might be worried about all this money being spent if it wasn't for my memories of previous campaigns  that first campaign i ran  the last campaign i ran in   i've been outspent before  i've had a lot of money thrown at me before  but you know what i've learned  is that when the american people decide on what's right  when all of you decide on what's true  when you remember the story of your families just like the story of my families  all the struggles our parents and our grandparents and great grandparents went through some of them maybe came over here as immigrants and started working in the mines or working in the mills  not always knowing what to expect  but understanding that there was something different about this country  looking out for one another  taking care of the community together  being responsible  having those old fashioned  homespun values  believing that being middle class wasn't a matter of your bank account  it was a state of mind in terms of what you believe  that there were some things that were important and nothing was more important than looking after your family and being with your family and caring for your family when americans come together and tap into that spirit that is best in us  all that money doesn't matter  all those negative ads don't matter  you make change happen  you inspire each other  you inspire me  in   i told you i'm not a perfect man and i wouldn't be a perfect president  but i told you i'd always tell you what i thought and i'd always tell you where i stood  and i told you i would wake up every single day fighting as hard as i knew how for you  to make your lives a little bit better  to give you more of a fighting shot to succeed and live out your dreams  and i made that promise because i saw myself in you  in your grandparents  i see my grandparents  in your children  i see malia and sasha  and i've kept that promise  i've kept that promise  every morning and every night  i've thought about how we build america and how we build america's middle class and how we give everybody a fair shot and how we make sure everybody's doing their fair share and how we make sure everybody's fighting by the same rules  and if you still believe in me like i believe in you  i hope you will stand with me in   because if you do  we will finish what we started in   and this economy will be moving again  and we'll remind the world just why it is that the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  ohio  how's it going  poland  well  it is good to be here  everybody have a seat  it is good to be here in poland  a couple of people i just want to acknowledge  first of all  give dan a big round of applause  he was outstanding  your congressman  tim ryan  is in the house doing outstanding work  one of my favorite people  former congressman john boccieri is here  give him a round of applause  and youngstown mayor chuck sammarone is here  where's chuck  there he is  right here  and all of you are here  and i'm excited about that   i audience member i  obama   i laughter i   i the president i  hey  so i hope everybody had a good fourth of july   i audience member i  yes  how about you   i the president i  i had a great fourth of july   i laughter i  we had some folks over to the house   i laughter i  had a little grilling going on in the backyard   i laughter i  a few fireworks  it gave us a chance to say thank you to the incredible men and women in uniform  we invited a whole bunch of military families over  they do such a great job preserving our freedom  it was malia's birthday  on the fourth of july  and she's now   and it used to be i could get away with telling her the fireworks were all for her   i laughter i  but she's a little old for that now  she doesn't believe me  but she says hi  michelle says hi  sasha  bo  everybody says hi  i think malia has got some friends over  and michelle decided unsupervised  year olds was not a good idea   i laughter i  but now  as you may have heard  we're on the bus here in ohio  we've been traveling through  we went to parma and sandusky and maumee  and now we're here  and oak harbor  akron  and i've been eating a lot   i laughter i  and people have been commenting i need to gain some weight  so the   i audience member i  yes   i the president i  wait i laughter i who said that  yes   i laughter i  well  you'll be happy to know that i've been eating  and in between the eating  we've been talking a little bit about politics  now  you guys are getting bombarded with all kinds of nonsense on tv  so i know that sometimes politics can be discouraging  and especially  washington politics can be discouraging  and it can seem small and it can seem petty  but the choice in this election could not be bigger and the stakes could not be higher  this year is going to be about more than just two candidates or even two political parties  what's at stake this time is two fundamentally different visions about how america moves forward  two ways of thinking about this country  when i think about america  i think about my family  and i think about my grandfather who fought in world war ii  and my grandmother  who  even with a baby  was working on a bomber assembly line  and when my grandfather came back home  he got the opportunity to go to college because of the gi bill  and i think about my mom  a single mom  because my dad left when i was a baby  so she had to raise me and my sister with the help of my grandparents  and it was tough sometimes  but she was able to do it and get her own education and then ensure i got a great education because she was able to get student loans and grants  and then i think about michelle's parents  her dad worked at the water filtration plant  a blue collar worker in chicago  and mom stayed at home looking after the kids  and then when the kids got older  she went to work as a secretary at a bank  and she worked there most of her life  and when i think about both michelle's family and my family  what i am reminded of is what made america great was this basic idea  this basic bargain  that all of you experienced in your own families  your parents  your grandparents  your great grandparents  maybe some of them emigrated here from someplace else  but the idea was  here in america  you could make it if you try  that it doesn't matter what you look like  where you come from  what church you worship in  the idea is that if you are willing to put in the work and take responsibility for your family just like dan was talking about if you're willing to stick with it and tough it out when times got tough sometimes  that ultimately  hard work was rewarded and responsibility was respected  and you didn't just look out for yourself but you looked out for your community as well as your family and your country  and you know  nobody expected to get fabulously rich  although it was great if people got rich  but when i think about my family or michelle's family  what made us rich was spending time together  and the idea was that if our families were of good character and had good values and you were willing to work hard  then you could find a job that paid a decent wage  and eventually  saving up  you could own a home  and you knew that you wouldn't go bankrupt when you got sick because you had some health insurance  and maybe you took a vacation every once in a while  and it wasn't necessarily some fancy vacation at some fancy resort  the best vacation i had when i was a kid was we my grandmother and my mom and my sister we traveled around the country on greyhound buses and on trains  and we stayed at howard johnsons i laughter i  and i was   and so if there was any kind of swimming pool it didn't matter how big it was  right you'd spend the whole day there  and then you're real excited to go to where the vending machine was and the ice machine and get the ice  and that was like a big deal   i laughter i  and you would just see the sights and stop by a diner someplace  so you'd have that chance to take a little bit of time off to spend with your family  and then when you retire  you were able to retire with dignity and respect  and you were part of a community  and that basic bargain is what built this country  that's what made us an economic superpower  that's what made us the envy of the world  not the fact that we had the most millionaires or billionaires  but the fact that our economy grew from the middle out and there were ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class  even if they were born poor  and the reason i ran for president the reason i ran the first time for a state senate seat on the south side of chicago was because for too many people that bargain  that dream  felt like it was slipping away for too many people  we had gone through a decade where people were working harder and harder  but they didn't see any increase in income  and profits were going sky high for a lot of companies  but jobs weren't growing fast enough  and the cost of everything from health care to college tuition to groceries to gas kept going up faster than people's incomes  so a lot of folks felt like that idea that we not only could live a good middle class life  but more importantly  we could pass it on to our kids and they could succeed the way we might not have imagined they could go to college and do some things that we couldn't imagine doing that felt like it was slipping away for too many people  that's why i got into politics  that's why i ran for president  that's why in   a lot of you came together and helped support us  and we didn't even realize then that we were going to be getting hit with the worst economic crisis  the worst financial crisis in our lifetimes  and obviously  the hardship that occurred because of that made that dream even a little bit further out of reach for too many people  we came together and it wasn't just democrats  by the way  it was independents and republicans who wanted to figure out how do we put that basic bargain back together to grow the middle class not from the top down  but from the middle and from the bottom up  that was our idea  now  we knew from the start in   that turning that around wasn't going to happen overnight  it didn't happen overnight  and so we weren't going to reverse it overnight  but we've been steady  we've worked hard  and i know all of you have worked hard  and dan's story is typical of so many people i meet who had to make adjustments and deal with some disappointments  but came back stronger and came back tougher  and that's what america and that's what ohio has been doing  so over the last several years  what we've seen are people who go out and retrain for new jobs  and small businesses have to adapt  and sometimes  the owner doesn't take a salary just to keep folks on the payroll  and i met a woman yesterday in parma who i had met a year earlier  she had been out of work for   years and had gone back to community college at the age of   and retrained  and i saw her in the rope line after my speech  she had just been certified and was starting her new job on tuesday and after having done   years at a community college  so those stories are duplicating themselves all across ohio and all across the country  but it's still tough out there  we learned this morning that our businesses created   new jobs last month  and that overall means that businesses have created   million new jobs over the past   months  including   new manufacturing jobs  that's a step in the right direction   i applause i  that's a step in the right direction  but we can't be satisfied  because our goal was never to just keep on working to get back to where we were back in   i want to get back to a time when middle class families and those working to get into the middle class have some basic security  that's our goal  so we've got to grow the economy even faster  and we've got to put even more people back to work  and we've got to tap into the basic character of this country  because our character has not changed  even though we've gone through some tough times these last few years  it hasn't changed our character  it hasn't changed what made us great  it hasn't changed why we came together in   so again  our mission is not just to get back to where we were before the crisis  we've got to deal with what's been happening over the last decade  the last   years manufacturing leaving our shores  incomes flatlining all those things are what we've got to struggle and fight for  and that's the reason that i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  i want to move this country forward   i applause i  i want to move this country forward   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  now  here's the thing  remember  i told you this was a choice that we've got to make  because what's holding us back right now is not that we don't have good answers for how we could grow the economy faster or put more people back to work  the problem is we've got a stalemate in washington  we've got two fundamentally different ideas about where we should take the country  and this   i audience member i  put congress to work   i laughter i   i the president i  we're trying to put congress to work   i laughter i  and this election is about how we break that stalemate  and the good news is it's in your power to break this stalemate  it's in the power of everybody who lives in ohio  everybody who lives in poland  everybody who lives all across the midwest  all those folks out there  whether you're punching a clock or starting a business  you've got a chance to move this country forward  but you're going to have to make a choice about which direction we go in  now  my opponent and his allies in congress and the special interests that support them they've got a particular idea of how you grow an economy  it's actually a pretty simple idea   i laughter i  their basic idea is that if we spend trillions of dollars more on tax cuts  most of the benefits going to some of the wealthiest individuals in the country so the average millionaire gets a   tax break  even if we've got to gut education to do it  even if we've got to cut job training programs to do it  even if we've got to increase middle class taxes to do it  if we cut trillions of dollars in taxes and we eliminate regulations  all kinds of regulations  the regulations we just put in place to make sure that wall street doesn't engage in reckless behavior that we have to bail out later or regulations that prevent insurance companies from excluding people with preexisting conditions from coverage or regulations that protect consumers from being taken advantage of by credit card companies  if we eliminate all those regulations and we combine those with the tax cuts  then wealthy investors and companies will do very well and the benefits then will spread to everybody else  now  that's the idea  i'm not making this up  i'm sure that they would say it differently  they'd describe it differently  but that's their basic theory  and you can go to mr  romney's web site  or you can look at the plan that the republicans in the house of representatives voted for  and you'll see that that's basically their plan  that's their vision  their basic idea is if everybody is just on their own  doing what they do  everything is going to turn out just fine  now  it's a theory   i laughter i  but i think it's wrong  i think it's wrong   i applause i  i think it's wrong  and the reason i think it's wrong is we just tried it  we tried it in the decade before i took office  and let's look at what happened  we saw us fighting two wars on a credit card  the tax cuts turned a surplus into a deficit  and the lack of regulation resulted in what happened on wall street  and we ended up with the biggest crisis that we've ever seen   i audience member i  that ain't right   i the president i  it ain't right   i laughter i  it's not a smart theory  i mean  if we hadn't tried it before you might say  okay  let's give that a shot   i laughter i  but we just tried it  and it didn't work  and you know  if you look throughout our history  that kind of top down economics has never worked  so we've got to have somebody who's fighting for you  somebody who's thinking about how to grow the economy from the middle out  from the bottom up  not from the top down  that's why i'm running for a second term as president  i've got a different idea  i've got a different theory   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  just like their theory has been tested  let's talk about my theory  my vision  when the american auto industry was on the brink of collapse  and more than   million jobs were on the line  and   in   jobs in ohio depends on the auto industry not just the folks in the auto plants  not just the union workers  but all those suppliers up and down the chain  every restaurant outside the plant  every store  every school depends on those jobs and that industry and you had some folks saying let's let detroit go bankrupt  and they weren't just talking about detroit  by the way  we said  you know what  we're going to bet on the american worker  we're going to bet on american industry  and now chrysler is back  and gm is the number one company in the world  and ford is on the move  that's my theory  betting on the american worker and american businesses  that's why i want to move us forward  and i believe that what happened in the auto industry can happen in a lot of other industries  because i believe in american manufacturing  the future of american manufacturing can still be forged in places like youngstown and cleveland and pittsburgh  and i'm going to run to make sure that that happens  i want to sell more goods stamped with three proud words  made in america   i applause i  made in america  and that starts with us changing our tax code so we stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in poland  ohio  in parma  ohio  in cincinnati  ohio  in the united states of america  now  you look at the success of dan's company  i just went over and visited and took some sauce i laughter i that i am going to use this weekend  those are the kinds of companies that started as a family business and are now growing and growing and expanding  and suddenly they become medium sized businesses  then they become big businesses  and america has got the most competitive workers on earth  the most productive  but we've got to make sure that our laws are encouraging investment here in the united states  now  this is a different idea than the other guy  now  mr  romney's experience because he always says  i've got a lot of business experience  i know how to create jobs   i laughter i  well  look  his company that he started were called the  pioneers  of business outsourcing the  pioneers  of outsourcing  so that's his experience  my experience is working with workers and management to save the auto industry  that's your choice  because i'm going to fight for your job here in the united states  but that's not enough  that's not the whole vision  because we've also got to continue to improve our own competitiveness  which means that i'm running to make sure that once again  our kids are getting the best education in the world  i want us to hire new teachers  not lay more teachers off  especially in math and science  i want to extend the tuition tax credit that we put in place that's already saved millions of families thousands of dollars  i want to extend that  we just won the fight to stop congress from letting student loan rates double for   million students  now i want to work with colleges and universities to bring tuition down once and for all  i want to give   million more americans the chance to go to community colleges and learn the skills like that woman i saw yesterday had learned  because there are jobs out there right now that aren't matched up with the skills people have  and if we get those companies to come in and help design the training programs  those folks can go back to work  i want   million more of those folks benefiting from that kind of partnership between businesses and community colleges  i want to do more in the area of housing  my administration has already helped more than a million responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages  but that's only a few of the potential families that could take advantage of historically low rates  so what we've said to congress is  let's get to work  give everybody the chance to refinance  including folks whose homes are underwater  that will save the average family   a year  who can use   a year  put that money in your pockets  and that allows you that's like a huge tax cut for you  which you could then spend at restaurants and at stores and helping to pay that college tuition for that kid who is going off to college  it could make all the difference in the world  that's my theory of how you grow an economy  i'm running because i continue to be convinced that in a country like ours  the greatest country on earth  nobody should go bankrupt just because they get sick  i am proud of the work we did to get that health care law passed  it was the right thing to do  john boccieri knows it was the right thing to do  over in parma yesterday  i saw a woman john and i both know named natoma canfield  i've got a letter that she wrote  hung up in the oval office  that talks about her fears when she got cancer and the fact that she wasn't sure she'd ever be able to get insurance again  and she kept on trying to hang onto it because she was worried she'd get that cancer back  and finally  she had to let her insurance go  and she didn't know what was going to happen  and because of this bill  she is able to get the treatment she needs  and you know what  i'll work with anybody who wants to continue to work whether it's the state level or the federal level to continue to improve this law  but it was the right thing to do  to make sure that if you've got a preexisting condition  you can still get health insurance  it was the right thing to do  for those of you who already have health insurance  the only thing this does is make your health insurance more secure  because it means insurance companies can't impose lifetime limits or use fine print  so when you really need it  suddenly  the insurance isn't there  it's what's allowing your kids to potentially stay on your health insurance policy up to   years old  it's helping seniors get a better deal on their prescription drugs  and it will help people who don't have health insurance for the first time be able to get it at affordable prices  it's the right thing to do  and by the way  when you hear all these folks saying  oh  no  no  this is a tax  this is a burden on middle class families  let me tell you  we know because the guy i'm running against tried this in massachusetts and it's working just fine i laughter i even though now he denies it  basically  what we say is  you know what  if you have health insurance  you're all good  if you don't have health insurance  we'll help you get it  if you can afford to buy health insurance and you don't get it  so that you force us to pay for your health care when you get sick or you get in an accident  that ain't right  so what we're going to do is  we're going to charge you a penalty to make sure that you're not unloading those costs on everybody else  it will affect less than   percent of the population  because most americans are responsible and do the right thing  i make no apologies for it  we're going to keep it moving forward  it was the right thing to do   years ago  it's the right thing to do now  and we're going to keep moving   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  and you know what  the i'm going to embarrass him a little bit  but john boccieri  he may have lost his congressional seat because he voted for health care  but that's the kind of person he is  and that's the kind of responsibility you want from your representatives  and i couldn't be prouder of him for it  that's a class act right there  i'm running because after a decade of war  i promised to end the war in iraq  and i did  we're transitioning out of afghanistan  we took the fight to al qaida  and we have decimated their leadership ranks  including usama bin laden  and so now i think it's time for us to take half the money we were spending on war  use it to pay down the deficit  let's take the other half and do some nation building here at home  let's put some folks back to work here in ohio rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our schools  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  and speaking of deficits  i had a trillion dollar deficit sitting on my doorstep when i walked into the oval office   i laughter i  and all of us agree we've got to pay down our debt  we've got to make sure that we're living within our means  but we've got to do it in a responsible way  i want to make sure that after a decade of irresponsible decisions that we deal with this in a way that is smart and helps grow our economy  we're not going to balance our budget on the backs of the poor  we're not going to do it by turning medicare into a voucher program  we're not going to ask middle class families to pay more so wealthy families can pay less  we'll cut spending we can't afford  we should  i was telling you stories about my family  my family didn't believe in handouts  they didn't get to where they were because they were always relying on some government program  they understood you got to work hard to make it in america  and you can't always help somebody who is not willing to help themselves  but i tell you what  even as we cut out programs that don't work  we've got to make sure that those of us who can afford to do a little bit more because we've been so blessed by this country  that the wealthiest among us can pay a little bit more to help close this deficit  folks like me can afford to do it  i promise you  i know  i've talked to my accountant   i laughter i  he said  you can do a little more   i laughter i  and i sure know mr  romney can do a little more   i laughter i  it's not going to and you know what  a lot of successful people around the country  i talk to them  they're willing to do more  because they believe in this country  and they understand that if you've been given all these blessings  you've got to make sure that you're giving a little something back  you've got to make sure that the next generation has the same opportunities that we did  and by the way  this theory i just described of making investments in education and rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our broadband lines and our wireless networks and getting more teachers in the classroom and making sure that we're taking care of our veterans and balancing our budget in a responsible way and having strong regulations in place so that consumers aren't taken advantage of and our air and water doesn't get dirty that's been tried too  it was tried by a guy named bill clinton  and during that time  we created   million new jobs  we had a budget surplus  and guess what  we created a lot of millionaires and billionaires too  it was good for everybody  businesses do well when middle class families can afford to buy their products  when middle class families can afford to take a vacation  when middle class families can afford to send their kids to college  everybody does well  that's my vision for america  see  all these things are tied together  all these things are tied together because they describe how we strengthen the fabric of our communities so that everybody can participate  so that everybody gets a fair shot  everybody does their fair share  everybody is playing by the same set of rules  that's what america is about  that's the big  diverse  optimistic  hopeful  generous america that we love  and that's the vision that we've got to fight for  because our parents and our grandparents  they passed that on understanding that each generation has to fulfill its own responsibilities and that it's not always easy  remember  my grandparents  they were they came out of the depression  had it a lot worse than we did  and they understood what it meant to struggle  but they were willing to struggle because they knew it would be good for not only their own families  but for the country  we've got that same responsibility  and we a lot of us understood that in   when we ran  and over the next four months  you will be bombarded with more negative ads  you've got these super pacs  millionaires  billionaires writing   million checks  just pouring raining down on my head   i audience member i  it's all right   i the president i  oh  no  it is all right  because i'm tough   i laughter i  i'm skinny  but i'm tough  i am  but the main reason it's going to be okay is because of you  what i learned in   was that when ordinary americans decide what's right  when they commit to working together to bring about a better day  they can't be stopped  you can't be stopped  and that has given me confidence through all the ups and downs of these last   years  it's what i think about in the morning and what i'm thinking about when i go to bed at night  i think about you  i made a promise in   i said  look  i'm not a perfect man ask michelle i laughter i i'm not going to be a perfect president  but i'll always tell you what i think  i'll always tell you where i stand  and most importantly  i will wake up every single day fighting as hard as i can for you  i'm thinking about you  because i see myself in you  i see my grandfather in your grandfather  i see my kids in your kids  i have kept that promise  ohio  and if you're willing to continue to stand with me and work with me and make those phone calls and knock on those doors  we will finish what we started in   and we will remind the world why america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  cedar rapids  oh  it is good to be back in cedar rapids  all right  couple of people i want to acknowledge  first of all  please give jason and his wife ali a big round of applause  they are just wonderful people  i'm so glad i had a chance to meet them  and now  they're debating what to name their son  so if you guys have some suggestions i laughter i  i asked them  what about barack   i laughter i  that was not yet on the list   i laughter i  but they are wonderful people  and they've got a incredibly cute guy named cooper  and so i really thank them for their hospitality  and we appreciate them so much  and jason is starting as a high school principal  so wish him good luck  he is going to do a great job  i want to acknowledge mick starverich   i audience members i  starcevich   i the president i  starverich   i audience members i  starcevich   i the president i  starcevich   i audience members   i yay   i the president i  i call him mick   i laughter i  and he is the president of kirkwood and our host today  thank you so much  i want to acknowledge our outstanding emcee  peggy whitworth  great friend  great friend of mine  and one of my dearest friends here in iowa  your outstanding attorney general  tom miller  is in the house  now  if you guys have a seat  feel free to take a seat  that way  if it gets a little warm  i don't want anybody getting overheated  you guys are kind of out of luck   i laughter i  so make sure you're hydrated  and abraham lincoln is in the house  my homeboy from illinois i laughter i and an outstanding republican endorsee   i laughter i  there you go  now  unless you've managed to hide your television somewhere for the last year  you may be aware that it is now campaign season   i laughter i  and here in iowa it seems like it's always campaign season  you guys can't get away from it  and i know that it is not always pretty to watch  there is more money flooding the system than ever before  there's more negative ads  there's more cynicism  most of what you hear in terms of the news is who's up or who's down in the polls  instead of how any of this relates to your lives and the country that you love  so i know that sometimes it can be tempting to lose interest and to lose heart and to get a little cynical  and frankly  that's what a lot of people are betting that you do  but i'm betting that you won't  i'm betting that you are going to be as fired up as you were in   because you understand the stakes for america  most of you are here because you know that even though sometimes our politics seems real small and petty  the stakes in this election could not be bigger  what's at stake is bigger than two candidates  it's bigger than two political parties  what's at stake is two very different visions for our country  and  cedar rapids  the choice that we make that will help determine our direction for years to come  that choice is going to be up to you   i audience members i  obama   i the president i  that's a good choice  now  this will be my last political campaign  no matter what  got i got nothing else to run for   i laughter i  but it's got and because of that  you start feeling a little nostalgic and you start thinking about some of your first campaigns  i think about all the places i used to travel in illinois and the first race i ran as a state senator  and michelle and i had to  like  xerox or go to kinko's and copy our little flyers  and we didn't have a tv budget back then   i laughter i  and we rode around in my car  and i filled it up with my gas i laughter i and i'm the one who got lost if i took a wrong turn   i laughter i  and what's amazing  though  when i think about it  was how many people you'd meet from every walk of life all across illinois  in big cities  small towns  upstate  downstate  quads  you name it  and you'd always hear similar stories from people about their parents or their grandparents and the struggles they had gone through and how they had been able to find a job that paid a living wage and look after their families and their kids had done a little better than they did  and those stories would resonate with me and michelle because that was our story  that was our lives  and then when i came to iowa for the presidential campaign first stop  cedar rapids i applause i first stop  first stop  cedar   i audience members i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  and the first stop was cedar rapids  and then we went on to waterloo  and i that was the first time i had campaigned as president  and i was kind of nervous  we had this huge town hall  and i don't remember what i said   i laughter i  most of the time i was just worrying about screwing up   i laughter i  but the same thing that i saw in illinois i was seeing in iowa  this was a state that gave me a chance when nobody else would  and no matter what the national media was saying  no matter how far down we were in the polls  we'd come here and michelle and i  we'd feel hopeful  because we had that same conversation that we had had in my first race as a state senator or my first race as u s  senator  going to state fairs and stopping in towns and visiting vfw halls and diners and meeting people whose lives  on the surface  might have looked different than mine  but when you heard their stories  they were a common story  i thought about my grandparents  whose service in world war ii was rewarded when my grandfather came back from the war and my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line and they were able to go to college on the gi bill  buy their first house with an fha loan  i had a single mom who  with the help of my grandparents  was able to send my sister and me to great schools even though she didn't make a lot of money  she was struggling to put herself through school and working at the same time  and michelle would think about her father  who had worked as a stationary engineer at the water filtration plant blue collar job all his life  and her mom  who was a stay at home mom and then worked as a secretary for most of her life  and we thought about how far we had come and the fact that our lives were a testament to that fundamental american ideal that no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  america's a place where you can make it if you try  america's a place where you can make it if you try  and that same story my family story  michelle's family story i heard it from you guys  it was your story  and we understood  and we'd sit and talk  and we'd agree that america has never been a country of people looking for handouts  we're a nation of workers and dreamers and doers  and we understand that we've got to work for everything that we've got  and all we ask for is that hard work pays off  that responsibility is rewarded  so that if you put in enough effort  if you're willing to put in some sweat and tears and overcome some difficulties in your life  then you can find a job that pays the bills and afford a home that you can call your own and count on health care when you get sick and put away enough to retire on  maybe take a vacation once in a while  i was telling folks in ohio the other day  i remember my favorite vacation when i was   years old  traveling the country with my grandmother and my mom and my sister  and once in a while we'd rent a car  but a bunch of times we'd just take greyhound buses  and sometimes we'd take the train and stay at howard johnson's  and as long as there was a little puddle of a pool  i'd be happy   i laughter i  and you'd go to the ice machine and the vending machine and buy a soda and get the ice  and you were really excited about it   i laughter i  and what was important was just the time that you had to spend with your family  it wasn't anything fancy  but you understood that you could spend time with your family  they were cared for  you had a sense of security  you could provide for your children an education that would allow them to do even better than you did  that was the basic bargain that built america's middle class  the largest middle class on earth  that's what built our prosperity  the greatest economy the world's ever known  and so those shared memories  those shared stories that was the basis of our campaign when i ran for president  that's why i talked about the first time i came to cedar rapids  because we came together as democrats and independents and republicans because for too long that basic bargain  that vision of what it means to make it in america  had been slipping away for too many folks  people were working harder for less  it was more difficult to save  more difficult to retire  the cost of health care and college was going through the roof  and we understood that turning that around was not going to be easy  we knew it would take more than   year or one term or maybe even one president  now  what we didn't know was that we were about to get hit with the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes  and that crisis has put us through some really tough times here in iowa and all across the country  it robbed millions of our fellow americans their jobs and their homes and their savings  and it made the american dream seem even further out of reach for too many hard working people  but the basic idea of why i ran in   the reason you're here today  is because that crisis did not change who we are  it did not change our character  it did not change our values  we still know what makes us great  we still know that what makes us great is the fact that if you work hard in this country  you can still make it  that vision we still believe in  the vision of a strong middle class is what we're fighting for  our mission right now is not just to recover from a recession  it's to reclaim the basic security that so many americans have lost  our goal is to put people back to work  but it's also to build an economy where that work pays off  an economy in which everybody  whether they start a business or they're punching a clock  can have confidence that if you work hard  you can get ahead  that's what this campaign is about  iowa  that's what i've been fighting for for the last   years  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  now  you know what's holding us back from meeting this challenge is not a lack of ideas or a lack of solutions  what's holding us back from making even more progress than we've made is a stalemate in washington between two fundamentally different views about which path we should take as a country  and this election is about breaking that stalemate  this election will determine our economic future for the next generation  and frankly  the choice could not be clearer  my opponent  his allies in congress  they sincerely believe that prosperity comes from the top down   i audience members i  no   i the president i  they believe that if we spend trillions of dollars more on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy that it will somehow create more jobs  even if we have to pay for it by gutting education  chopping assistance to community colleges and pell grants  cutting back on training   i audience members i  no   i the president i raising middle class taxes   i audience members i  no   i the president i  they believe that if we roll back regulations that we put in place on banks and insurance companies and oil companies  all meant to protect our people and our economy  that somehow everybody is going to be better off   i audience members i  no   i the president i  and i think they're wrong  i think they're wrong  and listen  listen  it's not just my opinion  we tried it their way through most of the last decade  and it didn't work  we fought two wars on a credit card  still paying for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that didn't lead to more jobs or better wages for the middle class  and the lack of rules on wall street is what allowed people to take shortcuts and game the system in a way that caused this whole mess in the first place  so we tried what they're selling  and it didn't work  and somehow they think you don't remember   i laughter i  but you remember  and we don't need more top down economics  what we need is somebody who's going to fight every single day to grow the middle class  because that's how our economy grows  from the middle out  from the bottom up  where everybody's got a shot  that's how the economy grows  so i was over at jason and ali's and wonderful  wonderful story  really nice family  jason's the new principal over at central city high  ali's an account manager at a document scanning company  they've got a very cute  year old  cooper  and then the yet to be named other cute one   i laughter i  they met at a convenience store where they worked while they were in school  apparently  ali was jason's boss   i laughter i  and she is still his boss   i laughter i  that does not change  that's how it works   i laughter i  so we were talking about something that nobody looks forward to  and that's paying taxes  everybody understands it's something you have to do  you don't love doing it  but we were talking about how over the last   years  because of policies my administration put in place  we've been able to offer the mclaughlins about   in tax relief  and they said that's made a real difference in their lives  it's helped them pay their bills  helped them get daycare for cooper  we were sitting and i was telling them the house they're in now is roughly the same size as the house that michelle and i lived in for the first   years that we were married  we had a little co op  and when they were talking about the bills  i remembered going through them  you got the mortgage  you got the student loans  you got the electricity bill  car note  gas bill  daycare  everything they were talking about was familiar because michelle and i went through it  and that   helped  it made a difference  now we've got a choice to make  because on january   taxes are scheduled to go up on everybody in america  that's what the law says right now  if we don't do anything  if congress doesn't do anything  taxes will go up on everybody at the end of this year  yesterday i called on congress to stop any tax hikes for the   percent of americans who are just like the mclaughlins just like you  because if congress doesn't act  then that tax hike could cost up to   for a family of four  that wouldn't just be a big financial hit for jason and ali  because as they pointed out and this is what i love about america and what i love about them they said  as tight as things may be for us  we're a lot better off than a lot of folks we know  so imagine if it's tough for them what it's going to be for somebody else   i audience member i  like my mom   i the president i  like your mom   i laughter i   i audience member i  that's right   i the president i  it would be not only a huge blow to those families  it would be a big blow to our entire economy at a time when we need all the help we can get  now  i believe that we should make sure that taxes on the   percent of americans don't go up  and then we should let the tax cuts expire for folks like me  for the top   percent of americans  so anybody making over   a year  including me  we'd go back to the tax rates that we were paying under bill clinton  which  by the way  was a time when our economy created nearly   million new jobs  the biggest budget surplus in history  and created plenty of millionaires to boot  and by the way  the reason i say that is not because i just love to pay taxes   i laughter i  it's because i know i can afford it  and to give me another tax break or to give warren buffett another tax break or to give mitt romney another tax break   i audience members i  no   i the president i that would cost about a trillion dollars  and we can't afford it  not at a time where we're trying to bring down our deficit  not at a time when we're trying to reduce our debt  so this has nothing to do with me wanting to punish success  we love folks getting rich  i hope malia and sasha go out there and if that's what they want to do  that's great  but i do want to make sure that everybody else gets that chance as well  and for us to give a trillion dollars' worth of tax breaks to folks who don't need it  who folks who don't need it and aren't even asking for it  that doesn't make sense  now  the republicans in congress and mr  romney disagree with me  and that's what democracy's all about  they want more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  on top of the existing bush tax cuts  they want to give   trillion more in tax cuts   i audience member i  no way   i the president   i and that fight is a big part of what this election's about  we're going to have that debate  here in iowa and all across the country  but in the meantime  doesn't it make sense for us to agree to keep taxes low for   percent of americans who are working hard and can't afford a tax hike right now  i mean  think about it  i want to hold taxes steady for   percent of americans  republicans say they want to do the same thing  we disagree on the other   percent  well  what do you usually do if you agree on   percent and you disagree on   percent   i audience members i  compromise   i the president i  why don't you compromise to help the middle class  go ahead and do the   percent  and we can keep arguing about the   percent  let's agree when we can agree  let's not hold the vast majority of americans hostage while we debate the merits of another tax cut for the other   percent  in other words  let's stand up for families like yours that are working hard every day  give you some certainty so you can start planning  so you have an idea of what's coming next year  and that's what this election's about  ultimately  cedar rapids  that's why i'm running for a second term as president  because i believe we can make progress right now that helps you and your families  that's what i'm going to be fighting for   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  this tax issue is part of a broader debate we're going to have about how we rebuild an economy that grows the middle class and gives opportunity to everybody who is trying to get into the middle class  when the american auto industry was on the brink of collapse and more than   million jobs were on the line  governor romney said we should  let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i refused to turn my back on a great american industry and great american workers  i bet on american workers  i bet on american manufacturing  and   years later  the american auto industry has come roaring back  that's what this election's about  because what's happening in the auto industry can happen in other industries  and i'm running to make sure it does  i want hi tech manufacturing to take root in places like cedar rapids and newton and des moines  i want goods stamped with  made in america  selling all around the world  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs and factories overseas and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in the united states of america  now  governor romney has experience owning companies that were called  pioneers  in the business of outsourcing  my experience has been working with outstanding members of labor and great managers to save the american auto industry  and as long as i'm president  i will keep fighting to make sure jobs are located here in the united states of america  but we can't stop there  i'm running to make sure that america once again leads the world in educating our kids  training our workers  our tuition tax credit has saved millions of families thousands of dollars  i want to extend it  we just won the fight that we were having with congress to stop the federal student loan rate from doubling for more than   million students  we got that done  now i want to work with presidents and officials at universities and community colleges to bring the cost of tuition down once and for all  i want to help our schools hire and reward the best teachers  especially in math and science  i want to give   million more americans the chance to attend great community colleges like kirkwood  help them learn the skills that local businesses are hiring for right now  because higher education is not a luxury in the  st century  it is a necessity  and i want everybody to be able to afford it  that's what this election's about  my administration has already helped more than a million responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages  well  i'm running to give more folks like them a chance to refinance and save   a year  my opponent's plan is to let the housing market  hit bottom  that's not a solution  that's part of the problem  that's a choice in this election  i'm running because i believe that nobody in america should go broke just because they get sick  our health care law was the right thing to do  it was the right thing to do  and you know what  i will work with anybody to improve the health care law where we can  but this law is here to stay  and it will help the vast majority of americans feel greater security  if you've got health insurance  it's going to be more secure because insurance companies can't jerk you around because of fine print  if you don't have health insurance  we'll help you get it  they're not going to be able to discriminate against you in buying health insurance because you're sick  and we're not going to tell the   million young people who have already been helped because they're now on their parent's insurance plan that suddenly they're on their own  and we're not going to turn medicare into a voucher system  we're not going to refight political battles from   years ago or   years ago  we're going to move forward and help every american make sure they feel some security when it comes to health care  i'm running because after a decade of war  we stopped and ended the war in iraq  we're transitioning out of afghanistan  and now it's time to do some nation building here at home  so i want to take about half the money we're no longer spending on a war  and let's use it to put people back to work rebuilding our roads  rebuilding our runways  our ports  our wireless networks  i know we got some trades here in the house  these guys  they're ready to work  they're ready to put a hardhat on  they're ready to rebuild america  that's what we need to be doing all across iowa  all across this country  we can't go back  we got to move forward  and i am running to make sure that we can afford to pay down our debt and our deficits in a way that is responsible  after a decade of irresponsible decisions  we need to reduce it  but in a balanced  responsible way   i audience member i  make sure you help our vets i   i i the president i  i will cut spending that we can't afford   i audience member i  help our vets   i the president i   and we're going to help our vets  we're doing it  we've actually increased fundingveterans funding since i've been president higher than any time in   years  the i applause i but you know  in order to bring down our debt and our deficits in a responsible way  it means cutting out things we can't afford  not every government program works  we can streamline government  i've asked for authority from congress to make sure that government is suited for the  st century  not the  th century  but what we've also got to do is ask the wealthiest americans who enjoyed the biggest tax cuts over the past decade to just pay a little bit more  and  you know  here's the thing  there are plenty of patriotic  successful americans who want to make this contribution  they're willing to do it because they remember how they got successful  all these things  whether it's bringing back manufacturing or getting construction workers back on the job or protecting your health care or saving the auto industry or making sure our kids get the best education  making sure our veterans get the care they deserve after fighting on behalf of our freedom all these things that make up a middle class life  they're all tied together  they're all central to the idea that made this big  diverse  hopeful  optimistic  hard working country great  the idea that if you work hard  you can have the security to make of your life what you will  the idea that we are all in this together  we are individuals  and we have to take responsibility  and nobody is going to offer you anything  but ultimately  there are some things we do together  that's the promise of our parents and our grandparents  they passed it down to us  it's the promise we have to pass down to our kids and our grandkids  that we don't just look out for ourselves  we look after other people too in our communities  in our states  in our nation  and next generation of americans  so over the next   months  you'll see the other side spending more money than we've ever seen before  and even though there will be a bunch of different ads  they'll all have the same message  they'll all say  the economy is not where it needs to be  and it's obama's fault  that's basically their idea  they know their economic theory isn't going to sell  so all they can say is  unemployment's still too high  folks are still struggling  and it's obama's fault  that's their message  that's it  they're they don't have another one   i laughter i  i guarantee you  you watch every ad  that's going to be the message  now  that may be a plan to win an election  but it's not a plan to create jobs  it sure as heck is not a plan to grow our economy  it's not a plan to revive our middle class  they don't have that plan  i've got that plan  iowa  so let me tell you  we have been outspent before  we've been counted out before  but through every one of my campaigns  what's always given me hope is you  your ability to cut through the nonsense  your ability to identify what's true  to tap into those values that we all believe in  i know that you guys remember the story of your family just like i remember mine  and all the struggles of our parents and our grandparents and great grandparents  everything they went through  some of them coming here as immigrants  maybe working in a mine  working in a mill  farming the land  they didn't know what to expect  but they understood there was something special about this country  they knew that this was a country where people are free to pursue their own dreams  but that we still come together as one american family  and they knew that being middle class wasn't just about having a certain amount of money in your bank account  it was about the values you cared about and the responsibilities that you took and the communities that you believed in and how you were able to have some security to take care of your family and give your children a better chance than you did  and when we come together and we tap into those values  when we remember what we're made of and who we are and how we got here and that we didn't get here alone because somebody out there was helping us along the way  then all that money spent on tv advertising doesn't matter  all those negative ads don't happen   i audience member i  we're not buying it   i the president i  that's what i remember  that's what i know about how you guys not only inspired me  but you inspired each other  and you can still do that  you still inspire me  when i told you in   that i was running for president  i told you  look  i'm not a perfect man michelle tells me that   i laughter i  and i wouldn't be a perfect president  but i promised that i would tell you what i thought  i'd tell you where i stood  and i promised i would work every single day  i would fight as hard as i knew how  for you  because i saw myself in you  i saw my kids in your kids and my grandparents in your grandparents  and i've kept that promise  iowa  i have kept that promise  and i still believe in you  and if you still believe in me and you're willing to stand with me and work with me and knock on doors with me and make phone calls with me  i promise you we will not just win this election  we will finish what we started  and we will remind the world why america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  how's it going  iowa  well  it is great to see you guys  it is good to be back  i'm not going to give a long speech because i'm going to give a long speech there  but i just want to say  first of all  all of you guys who were involved   years ago  thank you  for those of you who are getting involved for the first time  welcome  this is going to be a close election  but i have so much confidence whenever i come to iowa  because i remember   years ago  even when the national press was writing us off  we would come here  michelle and i  and we would talk to folks  and we would sit in people's living rooms and drop by a diner or a vfw hall  and everywhere we went  we were reminded of the strength and the decency and the values of america  because nobody represents those values better than the people of iowa  we're going to have two choices in this election  and one choice is to take us down a path of top down economics and an approach that says  if we do good for folks at the very top  somehow everybody benefits   i audience members i  boo   i the president   i and my vision  which says  when we grow best it's because our middle class is doing well and everybody who's fighting to get into the middle class  and this debate we're having right now about taxes  where we want to go ahead and just make sure that   percent of the folks here  i suspect  would get the tax break that they need to help provide for their families  and folks like me  we can do without  and we can lower our deficit  rather than give more tax breaks to folks who don't need them and weren't even asking for them  that tax debate is representative of the kind of debate that we're going to be having on a whole bunch of issues all throughout this election  so the bottom line  though  is i'm going to need your help  and all of you are going to be bombarded with all kinds of negative ads  and it's going to be nonstop  but the thing you guys taught me   years ago is that when you have grassroots folks who are energized and enthusiastic  nobody can stop you  so i hope you guys are ready to hit the streets and knock on doors and make phone calls and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors  because if you do  we're going to finish what we started in   and remind everybody just why it is america is the greatest country on earth  thank you  iowa  love you  guys  hope you're still fired up and you're still ready to go "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  hampton  oh  it's good to be back   i audience members i  obama  obama  obama   i the president i  thank you   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  it is good to be back  hampton  hello  phantoms  how are the phantoms doing here  now oh  it looks like we got some rivalry here with the phantoms  couple of people i want to say thank you to  first of all  some people may not remember that when i announced for president  the very first endorsement i received outside of my home state of illinois   i at this point  an audience member clapped i   i the president i   was didn't say it was you   i laughter i  i didn't know about your endorsement  but what i do know is being in richmond and being introduced by then governor tim kaine  and he has been a great friend ever since  he was a great governor of the commonwealth of virginia  he is going to be a great united states senator with your help  now  you guys also have an outstanding ex governor who is making his mark and making a difference already in the united states senate give it up for mark warner  i believe that your fine congressman  who's always fighting on your behalf  is around bobby scott is in the house  and one of my favorite mayors in the country  we love her and she is doing an outstanding job mayor molly ward is in the house  you know   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you  thank you  i also want to acknowledge  we recently lost a outstanding trailblazer who made such a difference in the lives of so many  so we miss her  we pray for her family  she is in a better place  state senator yvonne miller  now  it's a little hot  everybody  so if you've got a seat  go ahead and take a seat  if you've got a seat  if you don't have a seat  hang in there  and i'll try not to be too long winded   i laughter i   i audience members i  take your time   i the president i  see  i know these are some churchgoing folks when they say take your time  i know we've got some outstanding preachers here as well  so i'm not going to try to compete with them   i laughter i  now  unless you've been managing to hide your television set somewhere under a rock i laughter i you may be aware that we're in the middle of campaign season  and let's face it  it's not always pretty to watch  there's more money flooding into the system than ever before  more negative ads  more cynicism  what you read in the newspapers  it's all about polls and who's up and who's down  instead of what actually would make a difference in your lives  and i know sometimes it's tempting to turn away from participating  and it's tempting sometimes to get cynical about the process and the possibilities of bringing about change in this country  but the reason you're here and the reason i'm here is because we still believe  we still believe in america  we still believe in hope  and we still believe in change   i audience member i  we got your back  mr  president   i the president i  and i've got yours  because as small and as petty as politics can sometimes seem  the stakes this year could not be bigger  in a lot of ways  the stakes are bigger than they were back in   because we're facing a choice between two very different visions for this country  and the choice between these two paths for our country ultimately is going to be up to you  now  this is my last political campaign   i audience members i  aww   i the president i  no  michelle is very happy about that   i laughter i  let me tell you   i audience member i  we love michelle   i the president i  but i know you all love michelle  i know that  but since this is my last campaign  it got me a little nostalgic about my first campaigns  i think about the places i used to travel in illinois  vfw halls and diners  and we'd go to small towns  and we'd go to big cities  and you'd meet folks from every walk of life  black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  gay  straight  disabled  not you name it  and everywhere i went  what was interesting was that for all the differences  there was something everybody had in common  and in people's lives i'd see my own life  i'd meet an older vet  and i'd think about my grandfather and my grandmother  part of that world war ii generation my grandfather fighting in world war ii  then coming home  and my grandmother  who had been working on a bomber assembly line they were able to go to college on the gi bill  and how they were able to buy their first home with an fha mortgage  and i thought about my mom  because if i'd see a single mom  i'd think about how challenging it was for her to raise me without a dad and raise my sister without a dad  but how she was able to put herself through school and work at the same time and give her child the best education this country had to offer  and i'd think about michelle's family  i'd meet a family  and it didn't matter whether it was some rural area or small town  you'd meet folks who reminded me of michelle's dad  who had multiple sclerosis  could barely walk by the time i met him  but never missed a day of work worked a blue collar job  and michelle's mom stayed at home until the kids got old enough and then became a secretary at a bank  and she worked as a secretary all her life  and they never had a lot  but they had a lot of love  and they had strong values  and they had discipline  and that's why michelle and her brother could go on and achieve things that their parents couldn't even imagine  and what i'd realized during that first campaign and all the campaigns after that was that our lives all were a testament to that fundamental american idea  the idea that no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your last name is  you can make it if you try  this country has never been full of folks looking for handouts  we're a nation of workers and doers and dreamers  we work hard for what we get  and all we ask for is that our hard work pays off  that our responsibility is rewarded  that if we're willing to put in the effort  we can find a job that supports a family and be able to get a home we can call our own  we won't go bankrupt when we get sick  take a little vacation once in a while  send our kids to college and let them do things so much bigger than what we did  and then retire with some dignity and some respect  and be part of a community and a neighborhood and a nation that looks after its own  that basic bargain is what built the biggest middle class we've ever seen  that basic bargain is what made us an economic superpower  that basic bargain is what made us the envy of the world  and in   we came together not just democrats  we had independents  we had republicans  all who recognized that that basic bargain was starting to fray  that it was getting weaker  we've gone through a decade that had seen wages and incomes not go up  job growth sluggish  surpluses turning into deficits  that middle class dream seemed like it was slipping away for too many people  and then just as the campaign was being completed and just as we were making some history  what we realized was we're going through the worst financial crisis and economic crisis since the great depression  we knew that turning this thing around would not be easy  we knew it was going to take more than   year or one term or maybe even one president  and this crisis has been tough on a lot of folks and a lot of families  it robbed millions of hard working americans their livelihoods  their homes  their savings  it pushed the american dream  that basic bargain  even further out of reach for too many people  but you know what  that crisis didn't change who we are or what we believed in  it didn't change our character as a country  it hasn't changed why we came together in   our mission right now is to put people back to work and recover from this recession  but it's more than that  it is also about how we restore that basic bargain that every american believes in  that if you work hard you can get ahead  our goal is an economy where hard work pays off  an economy where everybody whether you're starting a business or you're punching a clock everybody can have confidence that they can make it  that's what the campaign in   was about  that's what this campaign is about  that is the reason i am running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  let me just say this  for all the work that we've done  as tim kaine talked about creating more than   million jobs  making sure that we're bringing manufacturing back to our shores  restoring our auto industry so it's number one again  getting health care passed for all the work that we've done  we've got a lot more work to do  and what's holding us back from meeting these big challenges is not the lack of technical solutions  it's not the lack of big ideas  the problem is we've got a stalemate in this country at least we've got a stalemate in washington  actually  when you talk to ordinary people  they see common sense  but apparently it's harder to recognize in washington  so we've got a choice  the outcome will determine not just how things go a year from now or   years from now or   years from now  but maybe   or   or   years from now  my opponent and his allies in congress  they believe that prosperity comes from the top down   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  look  i mean  this is what democracy is about  we're going to have a debate about how to grow this economy and help build a strong middle class  and they believe that happens from the top down  they believe that if we spend trillions of dollars more on tax cuts for the wealthy  if we eliminate regulations that protect consumers make sure insurance companies can't take advantage of you  that we eliminate regulations that protect our air and our water and make sure our children are healthy if we do those things  then somehow even if we have to pay for it by gutting education or maybe raising taxes on middle class families or eliminating training programs  that somehow we're going to be better off   i audience members i  no   i the president i  that's their theory  now  here's the problem  they tried it  this country tried that for the decade before i took office  and it didn't work  we are still paying trillions of dollars in tax cuts for folks who didn't need them and weren't even asking for them  and it didn't lead to better jobs or better wages for the middle class  the lack of regulation and rules on wall street was exactly what allowed people to take reckless shortcuts that resulted in the crisis we're still dealing with  so we don't need more top down economics  that's my belief  that's my view  we need somebody who's going to fight for the middle class  i believe that's how you grow the economy  from the middle out  from the bottom up  looking after working people and making sure they've got opportunity  that's what i've been fighting for since i got into this office  that's what i'll be fighting for as long as i have the privilege of being your president  in the last campaign  i promised to cut taxes for the middle class  and i kept that promise  we've cut taxes by about   for the typical family  four years later  i'm running to keep middle class taxes low  this week  i called on congress to immediately extend these tax cuts on everybody who is making   a year or less  now that  by the way  includes   percent of americans  if you're one of the   percent whose incomes are less than   a year  you would not see a dime of tax increases on your income tax  now  if congress doesn't act  nearly   million families right here in virginia and i suspect most of you will see your taxes go up by an average of   on january    i audience members i  boo   i the president i  you don't like that   i audience members i  no   i the president i  so we need to keep this tax hike from happening  but the republicans in congress are refusing to act  they refuse to let you keep your tax cut  percent of americans keep their tax cut unless we also spend an additional trillion dollars on tax cuts for the top   percent   i audience members i  no   i the president i  now  keep in mind  this is the same house of representatives that have now voted   times to repeal health care  times  seems like once a week they vote even though they know they can't pass it  they vote to repeal health care  and even though they know it won't pass  they could take one vote to make sure your taxes don't go up  and they haven't done that yet  all because they want to keep tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires and folks like me who don't need it  our lives will not michelle and i  our lives will not be better  the average warren buffett's life is not going to be better if he gets that additional tax cut   i laughter i  and by the way  here's the important thing  the way this is organized  the truth is  those top   percent  they'd still get a tax break  just only up to   the money they made after that  that's when they would have to start paying slightly more  now  let me say this  if you believe that the recipe for economic growth is to give the top   percent additional tax breaks  then by all means you should send those folks to washington   i audience members i  no   i the president i  because that's not what i believe  that's not why i'm in washington  i'm there to fight for you  i'm there to fight for the middle class  i'm there to fight for families who are working hard every single day  people like me and governor romney  we do not need a tax cut  and that's part of what this election's about  because it represents these two different views  these two different theories about how you grow the economy  on almost every issue in this race  the choice couldn't be more stark  when america was seeing its auto industry on the brink of collapse  my opponent said  let's  let detroit go bankrupt  that would have cost about a million jobs  i said  i'm betting on american workers  i'm betting on american ingenuity  and you know what  gm is the number one automaker again because we made that bet  so now i'm running to make sure what happened in the auto industry is happening in other sections of manufacturing  it doesn't just need to happen in detroit  it needs to happen in cleveland and raleigh and richmond and hampton  governor romney  his main claim to fame  the reason he says he can fix the economy is because of his business record   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  it turns out that his business record was starting a company that's been investing in what were called  pioneers  of outsourcing  he wants to keep giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  i want to end those tax breaks  i want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing here in virginia  investing in american workers  investing in advanced american manufacturing so we can sell our goods around the world stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's why i'm running  i'm running because in   i promised to end the war in iraq and i have  i promised to go after al qaida's leadership and we have  and usama bin laden is no longer threatening america  our brave men and women in uniform and virginia has as many veterans and folks serving in our armed forces as any state in the country  and we could not be prouder of them but we're starting to bring our troops home  and our national security is  in part  going to depend on what kind of economy do they come back to  can they find jobs  can they start small businesses  and that's why  after a decade of war  i want to take half the money we're saving because we're no longer fighting in iraq and we're winding down in afghanistan  take half of that  use it to pay down our deficit  take the other half to do some nation building here in the united states of america  let's rebuild our roads and our bridges  our ports  our airports  let's lay broadband lines that can reach into rural communities that are isolated  high speed rail that can make sure that we're on the forefront of the  st century economy  that's what i'm fighting for  that's what i believe in  you know   i audience members i  we love barack obama   i the president i  i'm running again because we've done a lot of work in education  but we've got more to do  and i want to make sure we are providing every single child not just some kids  not even just most kids  but all kids the best education possible  our tuition tax credits save millions of families thousands of dollars  now i want to extend it  we just won a fight with congress  those of you who are over at hampton  other colleges and universities in the state  we just won a fight to make sure that your loan rates would not double  now i want to make sure that we're actually bringing down tuition and costs for college for every young person who's willing to work hard to get an education  i want to make sure our schools can hire the best teachers  especially in math and science  i want to give   million more americans the chance to go to community colleges and get trained for the jobs that businesses are hiring right now  in the  st century  higher education can't be a luxury  it is a vital necessity  that's why i'm running  i want to fight to make sure that everybody has the chance to get ahead  my opponent's plan to help responsible homeowners is to let foreclosures hit bottom  that's not a plan  that's not a solution  that's a problem  my administration's already helped a million responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages  i'm running to give everybody a chance to refinance  you could save   a year that you could then spend on going to a restaurant and helping a business get more business and fixing the basement and rebuilding the equity in your home  and that's good for everybody  that's good for the entire economy  that's an example of the kinds of things we could be doing if we break this stalemate  i'm running because i continue to believe that in america nobody should go broke just because they got sick  i'll work with anybody who wants to continue to improve our health care system  but the supreme court has spoken  this health care law is here to stay  we're not going backwards  if you've got health insurance  nothing's changing for you  you're not being charged a tax  the only thing that's happened to you is your insurance is more secure because insurance companies can't drop you because of some fine print or not cover your illnesses because you've hit a lifetime limit  insurance companies now have to cover young people until they're   on their parent's plan  which is helping young people all across the country  we're not going to let medicare get turned into a voucher system  we're not going to spend the next   years refighting the battles of the last   years  we need to move forward  and i am running to make sure that we pay down on our debts and reduce our deficits  but do so in a responsible  balanced way  and that means  yes  cutting out programs we can't afford  i don't believe every government program works  and government shouldn't try to help everybody  if you don't want to get help  we can't help you  if you're not willing to work hard  there's only so much that can be done  but you know what  we're not going to sacrifice education and training and basic research into things like cancer and alzheimer's  that would be shortsighted  so if we're going to reduce our deficit and debt  we have to do it smartly  get rid of programs that aren't helping the economy grow  but also ask the wealthiest to do a little bit more  and that includes folks like me  that includes people like mr  romney  and by the way  just like we tried their way and it didn't work  we tried what i'm proposing and it did work  bill clinton did it and we got   million new jobs and a surplus instead of a deficit  and a whole bunch of folks got rich in the process  because in america  when the middle class is doing well and folks who are poor and trying to get into the middle class have a chance  everybody does well  folks at the top do well because now they've got customers  it's good for everybody  that's how we grow the economy together  all these things whether it's bringing back manufacturing or construction jobs back  protecting health care  making sure kids get the best education  making sure our veterans are getting the training they need when they come home all this stuff ties together  they're all part of that central idea  that promise that if you work hard  you can get ahead  and the belief that we do that together  when my grandfather got that gi bill  when this generation is getting the post  gi bill  that's not just for them  it's for all of us  because if they're doing well  we'll all do well  when we built the golden gate bridge and the hoover dam and that wasn't just good for the folks in those states  that's good for the whole country  because it means we're moving goods and services and people faster around the world and we're more competitive  we rise or fall together  and now we've got an obligation to pass on that tradition to our children and our grandchildren  now  over the next   months  you are going to see all these negative ads with those voices of doom talking about how bad the economy is and how much it's obama's fault  and you'll hear it i mean  they'll say it every which way  but it's always the same argument  right  because they know their economic theory doesn't sell because the facts are it didn't work  that's their only message  so all they can say is  you know what  it's obama's fault  and if we get rid of him  somehow mr  romney's going to put it all back together although he won't tell you how   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  that may be a plan to win an election  but it's not a plan to put people back to work  it's not a plan to reduce our deficit  it's not a plan to grow the middle class  it's not a plan to revive the american dream  and the thing is  you know what  we've been outspent before  we've been counted out before  when i announced in   there was a whole bunch of folks who didn't believe  well  everybody now says they believe  but there were a whole bunch of folks back then who didn't believe  you know that's right  but you know what  through all the campaigns  what's always given me hope is the american people  there's a core decency  there's an honesty  there's a common sense that cuts through all the noise and all the distractions and all the nonsense  what gives me hope is remembering the story of your families because they're just like the story of my family  all the struggles of parents and grandparents and great grandparents who went through struggles we can't even imagine but somehow came out on the other end  who understand that even in the darkest of night there's a brighter day dawning  some of them came here as immigrants  some folks came not of their own accord  some came to work in mines  some came to work in mills  some worked the farms  and they didn't always know what was around the corner  but what they did understand was there was something different about america  they knew that in a land where people are free to pursue their individual dreams  they can still come together as one american family  they knew that being middle class wasn't about how much was in your bank account  but it was about an attitude that said if we work hard we can have enough  we don't envy folks who succeed  we think it's great if they get rich  but the main thing is family and values and being self reliant and looking out for one another and helping your neighbor and faith that's what's important  it's about the security of knowing that you can take care of your family and that your kids can do better than you did  and here's the thing  virginia  when people come together and tap into that basic  honest core of america  when ordinary folks start working together and point us in that direction  we can't be stopped  all the money  all the special interests  all the negative ads  it can't stop you  it can't stop you  in   i said i wasn't a perfect man and i wouldn't be a perfect president  but what i said was i'd always tell you where i stood  i'd always tell you what i thought  and i'd wake up every single day fighting as hard as i knew how for you  to make sure your lives are a little bit better  and so as much as we've got done  i know sometimes change doesn't feel like it's come fast enough  and i know there are still a lot of folks out there hurting  but you know what  i've kept that promise  i've kept that promise because when i see your kids  i see my kids  when i see your grandparents  i remember my grandparents  i see myself in you  i still believe in you  and if you still believe in me and you're willing to stand up and knock on doors and make phone calls and get organized  i promise you will finish what we started  we will win this election  and we'll remind the world why it is that america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  roanoke  it is good to be back in roanoke  good to be back in virginia  back in the star city  there are a couple of people i want to acknowledge  first of all  you've got one of the finest senators and public servants in the country in mark warner  give it up for mark warner  now  mark was a great governor for the commonwealth of virginia  and now he's a great senator  i just want to point out we've got another great governor of the commonwealth of virginia who is going to be a great senator in tim kaine  we are thrilled to have them both with us today  i want to thank mayor david bowers  who's here  city manager christopher morrill  fire chief david hoback  and we've got former majority leader of the house of delegates  dick cranwell is here  and all of you are here  couldn't ask for a nicer setting  it is beautiful flying in to roanoke  now  let me just say  unless you have managed to break your television set i laughter i you're probably aware that it is campaign season  and i know it's not always pretty to watch  we're seeing more money flooding into the system than ever before  more negative ads  more cynicism  a lot of the reporting is just about who's up and who's down in the polls instead of talking about the things that matter in your day to day life  so i know all this kind of makes it tempting to just turn off the tv set and turn away from politics  and there are some people who are betting that you lose interest   i audience members i  no   i the president i  but the fact that you are here tells me that you're still ready to work to make this a better country  you're still betting on hope  and you're still betting on change  and i am still betting on you   i audience member i  we love you  mr  president   i the president i  i love you back   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  well  let me just say this  if i win virginia  i'm going to get   more years  that i can say with some confidence  and the reason you're here tonight is because no matter how petty and small politics seems sometimes  you recognize that the stakes could not be bigger  in some ways  the stakes are even bigger now than they were in   because what's at stake is not just two people or two political parties  what's at stake is a decision between two fundamentally different views about where we take the country right now  and the choice is up to you  now  this is my last political campaign   i audience member i  aww   i the president i  no  it's true  there is a term limit for presidents  you get two   i laughter i  so no matter what happens  this will be my last campaign  and it makes you nostalgic sometimes  and i started thinking about some of my first campaigns  when i was traveling across illinois and illinois is a big state  and it's got big cities like chicago  and it's got small towns  and it's got rural areas and suburban areas  and you meet people from every walk of life  black  white  latino  asian  native american  you stop in vfw halls  you stop in diners  you go to churches  you go to synagogues  wherever you go  you're going to have a chance to meet people from different walks of life  and when i think about that first campaign  what strikes me is  no matter where i went  no matter who i was talking to  i could see my own life in the life of the people whose vote i was asking for  so i'd meet an elderly vet  and i'd think about my grandfather who fought in world war ii and my grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line during the war  and i'd think about how  when my grandfather came back home  because of this country  he was able to get an education on the gi bill  and they were able to buy their first home using an fha loan  and then i'd meet a single mom somewhere and i'd think about my mom  i never knew my dad  he left when i was just barely a baby  and so and my mother didn't have a lot of money  and she was struggling  and she had to go back to school raising a kid  later raising my sister  and she had to work while she was in school  but despite all that  because she was in america  she was able to get grants and scholarships  and her kids were able to get grants and scholarships  and they could go as far as their dreams could take them  and then i'd talk to some working folks  and i'd think about michelle's family her dad who was a blue collar worker  worked at a water filtration plant in chicago  and her mom was a secretary  and yet  despite never having a lot  there was so much love and so much passion and her dad had ms  so he had to wake up an hour earlier than everybody else just to get to work because it took him that long to get dressed  and he could barely walk  but he never missed a day's work  because he took pride in the idea that  you know what  i'm going to earn my way and look after my family  and i'd see that same pride in the people i was talking to  and what this reminded me of was that  at the heart of this country  its central idea is the idea that in this country  if you're willing to work hard  if you're willing to take responsibility  you can make it if you try  that you can find a job that supports a family and find a home you can make your own  that you won't go bankrupt when you get sick  that maybe you can take a little vacation with your family once in a while  nothing fancy  but just time to spend with those you love  maybe see the country a little bit  maybe come down to roanoke  that your kids can get a great education  and if they're willing to work hard  then they can achieve things that you wouldn't have even imagined achieving  and then you can maybe retire with some dignity and some respect and be part of a community and give something back  that's the idea of america  it doesn't matter what you look like  it doesn't matter where you come from  it doesn't matter what your last name is  you can live out the american dream  that's what binds us all together  now  the reason that i think so many of us came together in   was because we saw that for a decade  that dream was fraying  that it was slipping away  that there were too many people who were working hard  but not seeing their incomes or wages go up  that we had taken a surplus and turned it into a deficit  we were running two wars on a credit card  that job growth was the most sluggish it had been in   years  there was a sense that those who were in charge didn't feel responsible  and so we came together to say we are going to bring about the kinds of changes that allow us to get back to those basics  allow us to restore and live out those values  what we didn't realize was that some of that recklessness  some of that irresponsibility would lead to the worst financial crisis we've seen since the great depression  and i don't need to tell you what we've been through over the last   years because you've lived it  too many folks lost jobs  too many people saw their homes lose value  too many folks saw their savings take a hit  but you know what's given me confidence and faith is that fact that as i've traveled around the country now  just like i used to travel around illinois  that same decency  those same values  they're still alive  at least outside washington  times have been tough  but america's character hasn't changed  the core decency of the american people is undiminished  our willingness to fight through and work through the tough times and come together  that's still there  and so just as we came together in the last campaign not just democrats  by the way  but republicans and independents  because we're not democrats or republicans first  we're americans first  just like we came together in   we know that we've got to keep working  got to keep moving forward in   and we knew back then that it wasn't going to be easy  these problems we're facing  they didn't happen overnight  and they're not going to be solved overnight  we understood it might take more than   year or one term or even one president  but what we also understood was that we weren't going to stop until we had restored that basic american bargain that makes us the greatest country on earth  our goal isn't just to put people back to work although that's priority number one it is to build an economy where that work pays off  an economy where everyone  whether you are starting a business or punching a clock  can see your hard work and responsibility rewarded  that's what this campaign's about  roanoke  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members   i four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  let me say this  it's fashionable among some pundits and this happens every time america hits a rough patch it's fashionable to be saying  well  this time it's different  this time we really are in the soup  it's going to be hard to solve our problems  let me tell you something  what's missing is not big ideas  what's missing is not that we've got an absence of technical solutions to deal with issues like education or energy or our deficit  the problem we've got right now is we've just got a stalemate in washington  and the outcome of this debate that we're having is going to set the stage not just for the next year or   years  but for the next   on the one side you've got my opponent in this presidential race and his republican allies who   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  who no  no  look  i mean  we're having a good  healthy  democratic debate  that's how this works  and on their side  they've got a basic theory about how you grow the economy  and the theory is very simple  they think that the economy grows from the top down  so their basic theory is  if wealthy investors are doing well  then everybody does well  so if we spend trillions of dollars on more tax cuts mostly for the wealthy  that that's somehow going to create jobs  even if we have to pay for it by gutting education and gutting job training programs and gutting transportation projects and maybe even seeing middle class folks have a higher tax burden   i audience members   i no   i the president i  so that's part number one  right  more tax cuts for those at the top  part number two is they believe if you tear down all the regulations that we've put in place for example  on wall street banks or on insurance companies or on credit card companies or on polluters that somehow the economy is going to do much  much better  so those are their two theories  they've got the tax cuts for the high end  and they've got rollback regulation  now  here's the problem  you may have guessed  we tried this  we tried this in the last decade  and it did not work   i audience members i  no   i the president i  now  before i finish  can i say  by the way  that some of you have been standing for a while  and i see a couple folks slumping down a little bit  make sure you're drinking water  bend your knees  don't stand up too straight  the paralegals will be the paralegals   i laughter i  you don't need lawyers   i laughter i  the paramedics will be coming by  so just give folks a little bit of room  they'll be fine  this happens at every event   i audience member i  we love you  obama   i the president i  i love you back  but i just want to point out that we tried their theory for almost   years  and here's what it got us  we got the slowest job growth in decades  we got deficits as far as the eye can see  your incomes and your wages didn't go up  and it culminated in a crisis because there weren't enough regulations on wall street and they could make reckless bets with other people's money that resulted in this financial crisis  and you had to foot the bill  so that's where their theory turned out  now  we don't need more top down economics  i've got a different view  i believe that the way you grow the economy is from the middle out  i believe that you grow the economy from the bottom up  i believe that when working people are doing well  the country does well  i believe in fighting for the middle class because if they're prospering  all of us will prosper  that's what i'm fighting for  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  now  this is what i've been focused on since i've been in office  in   i promised to make sure that middle class taxes didn't go up  and in fact  because of the recession  you needed some help  so we cut the typical family's income taxes by   so if you hear somebody say that i'm a big tax guy  you just remember   for the typical family  that's the tax break you've gotten since i've been in office  four years later  i'm running to keep middle class taxes low  so this week  i called on congress to immediately extend income tax cuts on the first   of income  now  what that means is   percent of americans make less than   so   percent of folks would have the certainty and security that your taxes  your income taxes  would not go up a dime  and by the way  this is not a hypothetical  this wasn't some campaign promise  the reason i called on congress to act now is because if they don't do anything  on january   almost everybody here  your taxes will go up an average of    i audience members i  boo   i the president i  so we need to stop that tax hike from happening  so you would think that this makes sense  right  because the republicans say they're the party of no new taxes  right  that's what they always say  except so far  they've refused to act  and this might confuse you  you might say  why would they not want to give   percent of americans the certainty of this income tax cut  well  it turns out they don't want you to get your tax break unless the other   percent  the top   percent  they get their tax break as well  now  understand  the top   percent  folks like me  we're the ones who most benefited over the last decade from not only tax breaks  but also a lot of the money from increased profits and productivity went up to that top   percent  so the bottom line is  the top   percent doesn't need help  they're doing just fine  and i understand why they wouldn't want to pay more in taxes  nobody likes to pay more in taxes  here's the problem  if you continue their tax breaks  that costs a trillion dollars  and since we're trying to bring down our deficit and our debt  if we spend a trillion dollars on tax cuts for them  we're going to have to find that trillion dollars someplace else  that means we're going to have to maybe make student loans more expensive for students  or we might have to cut back on the services we're providing our brave veterans when they come home   i audience members i  no   i the president i  or we might have to stop investing in basic science and research that keeps us as a leading edge economy  or  as they suggested  maybe you would have to turn medicare into a voucher program   i audience members   i no   i the president i  i don't think those are good ideas  so what i've said to the republicans is  look  all right  let's have this debate about the tax cuts for the wealthiest folks  i don't mind having that debate  but in the meantime  let's go ahead and do what we agree on  which is give   percent of americans some certainty and some security  so far  they haven't taken me up on my offer  now  here  this gives you a sense of how congress works these days you've got the possibility of your taxes going up in four months  five months  and instead of working on that  guess what they worked on this week  they worked   i audience members i  nothing   i the president   i i laughter i  they voted for the  d time to try to repeal a health care bill we passed   years ago  after the supreme court said it's constitutional  and we are going to go ahead and implement that law  i don't know about you  virginia  but i think they've got a better way to use their time  i think helping you make sure your taxes don't go up  that would be a good use of congressional time  now  this is just a small example of the difference between myself and mr  romney  between myself and some of the republicans who are running congress  and look  virginia  i want to repeat  this is a choice  if you think their way of doing things is a recipe for economic growth and helping the middle class  then you should vote for them   i audience members i  no   i the president i  you can send those folks to washington  i promise you they will carry out what they promise to do  but that's not why i went to washington  i went to washington to fight for the middle class  i went to washington to fight for working people who are trying to get into the middle class and have some sense of security in their lives  people like me and mr  romney don't need another tax cut  you need some help right now to make sure your kids are living the kind of life you want for them  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  now  on almost every issue  you've got the same kind of choice  when the auto industry was about to go under  a million jobs lost  and my opponent said   let's let detroit go bankrupt  what did i say  i said   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i said i'm betting on america's workers  i'm betting on american industry  and guess what  three years later  gm is number one again  and the american auto industry has come roaring back  so i believe in american manufacturing  i believe in making stuff here in america  my opponent  he invested in companies who are called  pioneers  of outsourcing  i don't believe in outsourcing  i believe in insourcing  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  let's give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in roanoke  right here in the united states of america  let's invest in american workers so they can make products and ship them around the world with those three proud words  made in america  i'm running because our men and women in uniform have sacrificed so much  we could not be prouder of them  we could not be prouder of our veterans  and because of their efforts  i was able to keep my promise and end the war in iraq  and i now intend to transition out of afghanistan and bring our troops home  and what i said is  because of their outstanding work  we've been able to decimate al qaida and take out bin laden  and so now it's time for us to take half of the money we're saving on war and pay down our deficit and use the other half to do some nation building here at home  roanoke knows something about transportation  this was a railroad hub for a long time  so you know how important that is to growing an economy  let's take some of that money and rebuild our roads and our bridges and our rail systems  and let's build wireless networks into rural communities so everybody can tap into world markets  let's put construction workers back to work doing what they do best  and that is rebuilding america  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  that's the choice you face  i'm running to make sure that our kids are getting the best education in the world  when i came into office  we passed a tuition tax credit that has saved millions of families thousands of dollars  and now i want to extend it  but i don't want to stop there  we just won a fight  thanks to some of the folks who are here  including students from vt that we just won a fight to make sure that student loan interest rates would not double  but that's not enough  i want to lower tuition to make it more affordable for all young people  i want to help our elementary schools and our middle schools and our high schools hire more teachers  especially in math and science  i want   million more people to be able to go to community colleges to get trained in the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  because a higher education  a good education is not a luxury  it is an economic necessity  that's how we're going to win the race for the future  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president  to finish the job we started in    i at this point  an audience member collapsed i   i the president i  now yes  i we've got another person down there  okay  we see him  we've got to deal with homeownership  and the fact of the matter is that my opponent's philosophy when it comes to dealing with homeowners is  let the market bottom out and let as many foreclosures happen as it takes  i don't think that's part of a solution  that's part of the problem  so what i want to do is  i want to let every single person refinance their homes and save about   a year  because you'll spend that   on some of these stores right here in downtown  you'll help small businesses and large businesses grow because they'll have more customers  it will be good for you  and it will be good for the economy  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president  because i want to help america's homeowners  i am running because i still believe that you shouldn't go bankrupt when you get sick  we passed that health care law because it was the right thing to do  and because we did    million people who don't have health insurance are going to get help getting health insurance  six million young people who didn't have health insurance can now stay on their parent's plan and get health insurance  seniors are seeing their prescription drug costs go down  and by the way  if you've got health insurance  you're not getting hit by a tax  the only thing that's happening to you is that you now have more security because insurance companies can't drop you when you get sick  and they can't mess around with you because of some fine print in your policy  if you're paying your policy  you will get the deal that you paid for  that's why we passed health care reform  now  one last thing  one of the biggest differences is how we pay down our debt and our deficit  my opponent  mr  romney's plan is he wants to cut taxes another   trillion on top of the bush tax cuts   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  well  first of all  like i said  the only way you can pay for that if you're actually saying you're bringing down the deficit is to cut transportation  cut education  cut basic research  voucherize medicare  and you're still going to end up having to raise taxes on middle class families to pay for this   trillion tax cut  that's not a deficit reduction plan  that's a deficit expansion plan  i've got a different idea  i do believe we can cut we've already made a trillion dollars' worth of cuts  we can make some more cuts in programs that don't work and make government work more efficiently  not every government program works the way it's supposed to  and frankly  government can't solve every problem  if somebody doesn't want to be helped  government can't always help them  parents  we can put more money into schools  but if your kids don't want to learn it's hard to teach them  but you know what  i'm not going to see us gut the investments that grow our economy to give tax breaks to me or mr  romney or folks who don't need them  so i'm going to reduce the deficit in a balanced way  we've already made a trillion dollars' worth of cuts  we can make another trillion or trillion two  and what we then do is ask for the wealthy to pay a little bit more  and by the way  we've tried that before  a guy named bill clinton did it  we created   million new jobs  turned a deficit into a surplus  and rich people did just fine  we created a lot of millionaires  there are a lot of wealthy  successful americans who agree with me  because they want to give something back  they know they didn't look  if you've been successful  you didn't get there on your own  you didn't get there on your own  i'm always struck by people who think  well  it must be because i was just so smart  there are a lot of smart people out there  it must be because i worked harder than everybody else  let me tell you something  there are a whole bunch of hard working people out there  if you were successful  somebody along the line gave you some help  there was a great teacher somewhere in your life  somebody helped to create this unbelievable american system that we have that allowed you to thrive  somebody invested in roads and bridges  if you've got a business  you didn't build that  somebody else made that happen  the internet didn't get invented on its own  government research created the internet so that all the companies could make money off the internet  the point is  is that when we succeed  we succeed because of our individual initiative  but also because we do things together  there are some things  just like fighting fires  we don't do on our own  i mean  imagine if everybody had their own fire service  that would be a hard way to organize fighting fires  so we say to ourselves  ever since the founding of this country  you know what  there are some things we do better together  that's how we funded the gi bill  that's how we created the middle class  that's how we built the golden gate bridge or the hoover dam  that's how we invented the internet  that's how we sent a man to the moon  we rise or fall together as one nation and as one people  and that's the reason i'm running for president  because i still believe in that idea  you're not on your own  we're in this together  so all these issues go back to that first campaign that i talked about  because everything has to do with how do we help middle class families  working people  strivers  doers  how do we help them succeed  how do we make sure that their hard work pays off  that's what i've been thinking about the entire time i've been president  now  over the next   months  the other side is going to spend more money than we've even seen in history  and they don't really have a good argument for how they'd do better  but they're thinking they can win the election if they just remind people that a lot of people are still out of work and the economy is not growing as fast as it needs to and it's all obama's fault  that's basically their pitch   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  no  i mean  i'm just telling you  you've seen the ads  and they're going to run more of them  and there will be all kinds of variations on the same theme  but it will be the same basic message over and over and over and over and over again  now  their ads may be a plan to win an election  but it's not a plan to put people back to work  it's not a plan to strengthen the middle class  and the reason it doesn't worry me is because we've been outspent before  we've been counted out before  the pundits  they didn't think i could win virginia the last time  the last time i came to this part of virginia  all the political writers  they're all  like  well  he's not serious  he's just making a tactical move  no  i'm serious  i'm going to get some votes down here  and so the reason that i continue to have confidence is because when i look at you  i see my grandparents  when i see your kids  i see my kids  and i think about all those previous generations  our parents and grandparents and great grandparents  some of them came here as immigrants  some were brought here against their will  some of them worked on farms  and some worked in mills  and some worked in mines  and some worked on the railroad  but no matter where they worked  no matter how times were tough  they always had faith that there was something different about this country  that in this country  you have some god given rights  a life in liberty and the pursuit of happiness and a belief that all of us are equal  and that we're not guaranteed success  but we're guaranteed the right to work hard for success  they understood that  and they understood that succeeding in america wasn't about how much money was in your bank account  but it was about whether you were doing right by your people  doing right by your family  doing right by your neighborhood  doing right by your community  doing right by your country  living out our values  living out our dreams  living out our hopes  that's what america was about  and so when i look out at this crowd  you inspire me  and i have to tell you that the privilege of being your president is something that i thank god for every single day  i said to you back in   when i was running  i'm not a perfect man  you can ask michelle about that   i laughter i  and i told you i wouldn't be a perfect president  but what i did say to you was that i'd always tell you what i thought and i'd always tell you where i stood and that i would wake up every single morning thinking about you and fighting as hard as i knew how to make your life a little bit better  and over these last   years  i know times have been tough  and i know change hasn't always come as fast as you'd like  but you know what  i've kept that promise  i thought about you  i fought for you  i believe in you  and if you still believe in me  if you're willing to stand up with me and campaign with me and make phone calls for me and knock on doors with me  i promise you we will finish what we started  and we will restore that basic bargain that built this country  and we'll remind the world just why it is that america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  virginia beach  thank you  it is good to be back in virginia  a couple of people i want to acknowledge  first of all  please give ricki a big round of applause  we are so proud of her  not just for introducing me that's not that big a deal i laughter i but her serving her country  first in uniform herself and then as a military spouse  she is an example of what is best about america  and we could not be prouder of her  a couple other people i want to acknowledge  first of all  your outstanding former governor and soon to be united states senator  tim kaine  your outstanding former governor and already senator  mark warner  we've got your second congressional district candidate  paul hirschbiel is here  and i want to give a special acknowledgement to somebody who's not here  but who we will always remember  she was a true trailblazer  not just here in virginia  but across the country  and did so much for so many  so we are truly blessed to have known and we profoundly miss state senator yvonne miller  who is now in a better place  and our thoughts and prayers go out to her family  her two brothers were here i had a chance to meet them and we're so proud of them   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  now  some of you may have noticed that we are in campaign season  i know that's surprising to many of you   i laughter i  i don't suppose you've seen any advertising on tv   i laughter i  you know  we are seeing more money spent than any time in american history  a lot of it undisclosed  coming from folks who can write   million checks  most of the ads are negative  in fact  almost all of the ads are negative  and it's understandable that as you watch these tv ads  that you start thinking that politics just doesn't seem to get what's going on in your lives  that there's so much negativity and so much cynicism  and it's understandable if at a certain point  people just say  you know what  there's a disconnect here  this is not speaking to me  it's not speaking to what's going on in my neighborhood  in my community  but i just want to remind everybody that in   there were a lot of folks who didn't believe either in the possibilities of change  there were folks that counted us out  people who were sure that a guy named barack obama could not be elected president   i laughter i  and what we and so the reason we came together was not because we thought it was a sure thing  it was because we shared a set of values  we believed in the basic bargain that has been the bedrock of this nation for well over   years  and i was thinking as i was about to come out about this  which will be my last campaign   i audience members i  no   i the president i  no  no  i mean  there's a term limit thing in the presidency  this isn't like congress  i can't just keep on running   i laughter i   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  but it made me think about my first campaigns  my earliest campaigns  and the reason i got into politics in the first place  some of you know my grandparents were part of that world war ii  great depression generation  and my grandfather fought in patton's army and my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line  and when my grandfather came back at that point my mom had been born he was able to go to college because of the gi bill  and they were able to buy their first home with some help from the fha  and then my mother she was a single mom my dad left before i even remembered him  but she was still able to give me and my sister this unbelievable education because of scholarships and grants and the fact that she was willing to work hard so that she could work and go to school at the same time and raise two kids  and then i think about michelle's family  her dad  he was a blue collar worker  worked at the water filtration plant in chicago  and even though he had ms so he by the time i met him  he couldn't really walk  he had to use two canes  and he'd have to wake up an hour early  earlier than everybody else  to get to work just to put on his clothes and get ready for work  but he never missed a day's work  and michelle's mom  she stayed at home and looked after michelle and her brother until they got older  and then worked as a secretary most of her life  and yet  despite these modest beginnings  michelle and her brother craig could go to the best schools on earth  and rise up to do extraordinary things  so in my first campaign  when i thought about why am i getting into politics  the reason was because we my family  michelle's family we had benefited from this basic american bargain  this idea  at the heart of this nation  that if you're willing to work hard  if you are willing to take responsibility  then you are not constrained by the circumstances of your birth  you can go as far as your dreams can take you  if you're willing to work hard  then you can find a job that supports a family  and you can have a home to call your own  and you won't be bankrupt when you get sick  and even if you weren't born into wealth  you can make sure your kids get a great education and go on to college  maybe you can take a vacation once in a while  i was up in ohio talking about my favorite vacation  when i was   years old  my grandmother  my mother  my sister and me  we traveled the country  but we didn't do it on jets   i laughter i  we took greyhound and the train  and i think twice we rented a car  and we'd stay at howard johnson's  and if there was a pool somewhere  no matter it could look like a puddle it could be so small i laughter i i was so excited  and you'd go to the ice machine and the vending machine i was   years old  that was a big deal filling up that bucket of ice and getting that soda   i laughter i  and the point was that your vacation didn't have to be fancy  it just gave you a sense of how you could spend time with each other  that was part of that american dream  and then the notion that you could retire with dignity and respect after a lifetime of work  that's the idea that got me into politics  because my feeling was  given how much this country had given me and given michelle  i wanted to make sure that that same bargain held for the next generation  that it wasn't just about me  it was about making sure that every american had those same opportunities  and the interesting thing is  when i first started running for the u s  senate  let's say  in illinois  and i'd be driving around and we'd go to downstate illinois and small farm towns  or sometimes we'd be in the big cities like chicago  no matter who you met  they had those same stories in their background  black  white  latino  asian it didn't matter they remembered their parents or their grandparents or great grandparents  some of them immigrants  some of them brought here not by choice  but each successive generation believing that this union could be perfected and that if they really worked hard and were able to overcome whatever barriers in their way  that they could succeed  so i ran in   because i felt that that bargain wasn't reaching enough people  and the reason so many of you supported me in   was because you understood that that dream was slipping away for too many people   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  that we had gone through a decade in which wages and incomes weren't going up no matter how hard you worked  while the costs of everything from college to health care to groceries to gas kept on going up and people worrying that maybe their kids might not do as well as they did  when the idea was always that your kids do better than you do   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  and so that's what brought us together  the campaign in   was not about a single candidate  it wasn't about me  it was about us and our desire to make sure that the american dream continues for the next generation and the generation after that and the generation after that  and what now  what we didn't realize at the time was we were about to confront the worst financial crisis since the great depression  millions of people thrown out of work  folks losing the value of their homes  and so in some ways  that dream seemed even further away  but you know  we've worked hard over the last   years to try to restore that belief that in this country you can make it if you try  and that's how we were able to save an auto industry  when some said let's let detroit go bankrupt  we said we're going to bet on american workers and american industry and now gm is back on top  and ford and chrysler are selling cars because we believe in that american promise  business started getting back to basics  and we've now created more than   million new jobs  more than   manufacturing jobs created during this time  we've seen all across the country folks who got laid off retrained  go back to a community college and be able to find a new job in a new industry  small businesses struggling  sometimes keeping their doors open even though they're not taking a salary because they know their employees depend on them and their families depend on them  it's turned out that america is tougher than any tough times  but what we also understand is we've still got more work to do  because  virginia  the reason i ran and the reason you supported me wasn't just to get back to where we were in   the reason we came together was to restore that promise for middle class families and all who are striving to get into the middle class  that's what we're fighting for  and we've got a lot more work to do on that front   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  i've got to tell you  this election in some ways is going to be more important than   because after   years of not getting much help from the other side   i audience members i  boo   i the president   i i think what's fair to say is  is that we now have a stalemate in washington  solving our problems  making sure that good jobs are created here in the united states  making sure that those good jobs pay and have basic benefits  making sure that we're bringing down our deficit in a responsible way  making sure that we maintain cutting edge industries here in the united states  making sure we've got the best education system possible we know how to do those things  what's holding us back is not an absence of new ideas  it's not a lack of solutions  it's the fact that there are two fundamentally different visions about how we move this country forward  and so this election is about more than just two candidates or two political parties  virginia  this is about which direction we take this nation   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  now  the other side mr  romney and his allies in congress they've got a very particular idea about how we move this country forward  and it basically involves taking the country back   i audience members i  no   i the president i  their economic idea  you can summarize it really easily  they basically want to give   trillion in new tax cuts  mostly for the wealthy  on top of the bush tax cuts even if it means gutting investments in education  even if it means gutting investments in basic research  even if it means that we're not rebuilding america's infrastructure  even if it starts cutting into benefits that we're providing to our veterans  the basic idea is that if you help folks at the top  at the very top  and if you eliminate regulations that we've put in place to make sure banks can't just do whatever they want  or consumers aren't cheated by their credit card companies  or insurance companies can't take advantage of their customers eliminate those regulations  cut taxes at the very top  that somehow  all those benefits are going to trickle down on you   i audience members i  no   i the president   i that the economy is going to improve and you are going to benefit  now  i have to tell you  i think they're wrong  and the reason i think they're wrong  virginia  is because we tried it  we tried it for most of the last decade  and what were the results  we ended up turning record surpluses into record deficits  wages  incomes stagnated  job growth sluggish  and it culminated in the worst financial crisis that we've seen since the  s  now  if you try something and it doesn't work  why would you try it again  why would we want to go back to that  i've got a different idea  i don't think top down economics works  i believe that we grow this economy from the middle out  from the bottom up  i believe the heart and soul of this country is making sure that working people can feel some security in the middle class and we're growing our middle class and we're going back to that basic american bargain that says everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules  that's what i believe  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  if you want a specific example of the differences between my approach  my vision our vision and the other side's version  let's look at the debate we're having about taxes right now  i have cut taxes for middle class families by an average of   since i've been in office  because my attitude was working people were the ones who were hurt most severely by the crisis  and by the way  if they got a tax break  they were most likely to spend that money for necessities and put it back into circulation  and that would do the most for the economy  so just in case some of your friends or neighbors  or uncle jim  who's a little stubborn and been watching fox news i laughter i and he thinks that somehow i raised taxes let's just be clear  we've lowered taxes for middle class families since i came into office  now  what i've said is that the way the law is set up right now  if we do nothing  on january   everybody's taxes go up  everybody's income taxes go up on january   if congress does nothing  so what i've said is now is not the time to raise taxes on the middle class  the economy is still fragile  we're still digging ourselves out of this hole  so let's provide certainty to   percent of americans  ninety eight percent of americans make   a year or less  let's say to that   percent  your taxes will not go up  and by the way  this is the first   of income which means that even millionaires would get a little tax break because for their first   their taxes wouldn't go up  the republicans say they agree that middle class taxes should not go up  that's my belief  so what i've said is if we both agree that middle class taxes shouldn't go up  let's go ahead and get this done tomorrow  let's get this done next week  what's the holdup  well  it turns out that the holdup is we've got a disagreement on the top   percent  the top   percent  folks like me  we don't need a tax break  and it turns out if you give us a tax break along with the   percent  that costs about a trillion dollars  we already benefited from most of the tax cuts over the last decade  so we don't need it  we're least likely to spend it  it's least likely to give a boost to the economy  we can't afford it because we're trying to bring down our deficit and trying to control our debt  now  the republicans disagree with me on this  mr  romney disagrees with me on this  and my attitude is  well  that's fine  but let's not hold middle class folks hostage  the top   percent  those tax cuts  that will be settled in the next election  and i'm looking forward to having a debate  because if you say you want to bring down the deficit  but you're not willing to let tax cuts lapse for the top   percent  it tells me you're not serious about deficit reduction  but we can have that debate  but in the meantime  let's go ahead and help middle class families right now  and so far  i have not gotten an okay from the other side on that  and that tells me i guess they're not that serious about deficit reduction   i audience member i  those folks let him down   i laughter i   i the president i  now  but this is just an example of their broader theory  they think that if you just help wealthy investors  it helps everybody  i think the opposite  let's take small businesses  i've cut small business taxes   times since i've been in office  and by the way    percent of small businesses make   a year or less  so for   percent of small businesses  they'd also benefit if we went ahead and got that done right now  so far  they haven't taken me up on this offer  but what this shows is the difference in philosophy  because i believe that if you're doing well  then the country does well  i believe if the small business person and the teacher and the construction worker and the firefighter and all those folks who put in a hard day's work every day  if they're doing well  then everybody does well  that's my vision for america  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  i'm running because i want to make sure that every young person in america has a great education  i've got a plan to hire new teachers  especially in math and science  we've already expanded the pell grant program to help make college more affordable  provide tax credits to middle class families to help make college more affordable  i want to keep on going and make sure that   million more people can go to community colleges to get trained in the jobs that exist right now and lower college tuition costs  that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  i'm running because i believe we should have manufacturing jobs created here in the united states  i don't think the auto industry is unique  i think there are a whole bunch of companies who we can attract back to the united states  but we're going to have to change our tax code and stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  give those tax breaks to companies that are moving back here to the united states of america  hiring american workers  making products stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  i am running for president because there are a lot of folks in virginia who have served us in uniform with such bravery and dedication and patriotism  and i want us to keep faith with our troops and make sure that our fundingveterans get the benefits that they have earned and that military families like ricki's are getting the help that they need when their loved ones are fighting on our behalf  but part of keeping faith is also making sure that we've got a smart national security strategy  and it also means making sure that we've got a strong economy to support a strong military  in   i promised we would end the war in iraq  and we've ended it  we are transitioning in afghanistan and beginning to bring our troops home from that theater  we have gone after al qaida  decimated their leadership ranks  taken out osama bin laden  so now i think it's a good time for us to take half of those savings that we've gotten from winding down these wars  use half of it to pay for the deficit  use the other half to do some nation building here at home  let's put americans back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges  building broadband lines into rural areas  making sure that we've got the best airports and the best rail lines in the world  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  because i want to rebuild america and put people back to work   i audience members i  u s a  u s a  u s a   i the president i  i'm running because i want to build not just the best energy policy in the world here in the united states  i also want us to take the lead in clean energy  we've seen oil production go up  we're seeing natural gas production go up  and we've doubled our investment and production in solar and wind and biodiesel  i don't want us to be dependent on what happens in the middle east for our energy  i want us to develop homegrown energy  i want us to stop giving tax subsidies to oil companies that are already incredibly profitable  i want to double down on our investment in clean energy that's never been more promising in solar and wind and biodiesel and put people back to work so that we can free ourselves from dependence on foreign oil and build up america  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  and i'm running so that we bring down our deficit and our debt in a balanced  responsible way  we've already made a lot of tough cuts to the federal government  and i'm prepared to do more  i don't believe that every government program works  i don't believe that government is the answer for every problem  we're not going to improve our schools unless our parents are focused on education  americans can't be looking for handouts  there are some folks you can't help if they're not willing to help themselves  but what i also believe is  is that there are some investments like in education  or in basic research  or in transportation  there are basic investments we need to make to grow our economy  and so if we're going to bring down our deficit in a sensible way that grows the economy and grows our middle class  it can't be based simply on cuts to basic programs and asking nothing from those who have been the most fortunate in this society  so what i've said is we'll make cuts  but we're also going to ask the wealthiest americans like me to do a little bit more  and i promise you  we can afford it  and by the way  the last time we did that  it worked  bill clinton did it  and we ended up having   million new jobs  we went from deficit to surplus  and we created a whole bunch of millionaires to boot  so don't tell me that that's going to destroy jobs  that's going to create jobs because we're doing it in a way that focuses on building the middle class  and there are a whole bunch of wealthy americans who understand that and are willing to do the right thing if they're asked  and i'm prepared to ask them  that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  so we've got a lot of work to do  we've got a lot of work to do  and the way we're going to get it done is by you making a decision  there may be some there are people who agree with mr  romney and his allies in congress   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  no  that's how our democracy works  even though the theory that they are promoting they've tried   i audience member i  don't believe it   i the president   i and it didn't work  they want to try it again  that's the way our democracy works  but you know what  i'm betting that the american people  they don't want to go backwards   i audience members i  no   i the president i  you don't want to refight the fight we had in health care  let me tell you  health care was the right thing to do  if you already have health care  the only thing this bill does is make sure that it's even more secure and insurance companies can't jerk you around  it allows young people to stay on their parent's health insurance plan    million young people have already benefited from that program  it lowers prescription drug costs for seniors  it guarantees preventive care for everybody  including women  thirty million people are going to be able to get health insurance that didn't have it before  and that means and we'll help them get it  and the only thing that we have said is if you can afford to get health insurance and you don't  you can't pass those costs on to somebody else  you've got to take responsibility  that's part of the american way  so we're not going to refight that battle  i noticed the house of representatives the republicans in the house of representatives  they voted to repeal it again  that was the  d time they've done that   i laughter i  thirty three votes to repeal the health care bill  all it would take is one vote to make sure that all of you don't see your taxes go up next year  you tell me what would be a better use of time  mr  romney doesn't think we should have a timetable for getting out of afghanistan  i disagree  i don't want to go backwards  i want to go forwards  the other side says they want to go back to the days when you could not serve the country you love because of who you love  i disagree  i don't want to go backwards  i want to go forwards  mr  romney says that undocumented workers in this country should self deport  my belief is that we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants  and i want to make sure that we get comprehensive immigration reform that gives young people who've been raised here a chance to live out their own american dream  i don't want to go backwards  i want to go forward  all these things that i'm talking about  it all goes back to that first campaign i ran  it all goes back to my family and your family and this basic idea of how we make sure that the middle class is strong and growing in this country  how do we make sure that folks who aren't quite there yet  if they work hard enough  can get into that sense of security and take care of their families  and you know what  we have learned from our history that that's done together  when previous generations funded the gi bill or built the hoover dam and the golden gate bridge or sent a man to the moon or invested in the basic research that created the internet  they didn't do that because it was going to benefit one person or a handful of people or one group  they did it because they understood we rise or fall together  as one people  and that's how i want to move this country forward  together  as one people  and that's why i'm running again as president of the united states  but if i'm going to get there  i'm going to need you  the way this democracy works  the choice is going to be up to you  and over the next   months  you are going to see more negative ads than you've ever seen in your life  you're going to start getting out that dvr to block them out and fast forward and all that stuff  and the other side  they basically just have one argument  which is the economy is not where it should be and it's obama's fault  and they'll just keep on repeating that over and over again because they know they don't have new ideas  they know the american people wouldn't just buy what they're selling on its own  so they don't want to talk about what they're going to do  they just want to talk about what hasn't gotten done  and that may be a way to try to win an election  but it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to strengthen the middle class  and i don't care how much money they spend  what you taught me in   is that when regular folk  when working people  when all of you tap into that basic decency and goodness of the american people  when you focus on what's true and what's right and you cut through all the nonsense and all the noise and all the spin and you remember your families and your parents and your grandparents and everything they did to give you the opportunities that you had  then you can't be stopped  when you decide change is going to happen  change happens  when you decide we're moving forward  we move forward  that's what you taught me in   and some of you will remember  in that campaign i told you i'm not a perfect man michelle told you that too i laughter i and i told you i wouldn't be a perfect president  but what i told you was i'd always tell you what i thought  i'd always tell you where i stood  and i would spend every single day that i have the privilege of having this office thinking about you and fighting as hard as i knew how to make your lives a little bit better  i made that promise because i saw myself in you and i saw michelle in you  and when i look at your kids  i see my kids  and when i look at your grandparents  i see my grandparents  and because of the values we share  i believe in you  and i hope you still believe in me  because i've kept that promise  and i fought for you  and i'm going to keep on fighting for you as long as i have a chance to be your president  and if you're willing to stand up with me and knock on doors with me and make phone calls and get out and organize  then we'll finish what we started in   and we'll remind the world just why it is that the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  how's it going  virginia  you know  this feels kind of good  don't you think   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  i need to cool off a little bit  it was a little warm  well  i know these are some diehard political folks here  not letting a little rain chase us away   i audience members i  no   i the president i  although i know this from michelle  ladies  i do apologize for your hairdos getting messed up  we're going to have to treat everybody to a little salon visit after this  so  couple of acknowledgements i want to make real quick  first of all  an outstanding member of congress who's looking out for working people every day  bobby scott is in the house  state senator donald mceachin is here  state delegate jennifer mcclellan is here  and john montgomery is here  give him a big round of applause  now  i'm just going to cut straight to business  we don't have time for small talk here   i audience members   i four more years   i laughter i   i the president i  this is my last political campaign  we're term limited as president  and it got me thinking about my first political campaigns  i think about the places i used to travel as a state senator  when i was running for the united states senate  all across illinois  which is a lot like virginia  you got big cities  but you also have small towns  you got rural  suburban  urban areas  you'd stop in vfw halls or diners  or you go to churches or synagogues  and you'd meet folks  black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  you name it  and wherever i went  even if on the surface folks looked different  there was a common thread that ran through their stories  and in those stories i saw my own  so i'd meet an elderly veteran  and i'd think about my grandfather  who fought in world war ii  and my grandmother  who worked on a bomber assembly line while he was away  even though they'd already had my mother  and i'd think about how when my grandfather came back from europe  he was able to get a college education on the gi bill and how they'd buy their first home with the help of an fha loan  and then i'd meet a single mom somewhere who was working hard  raising kids  and i'd think about my mom  because my dad left when i was young  and so my mother had to work and go to school at the same time and yet  despite not having a lot of money  was still able to provide me and my sister with the best education possible and instilled in us a sense that if we worked hard  we could go as far as our dreams would take us  and then i'd think about michelle's parents whenever i'd meet a working family  because michelle's dad was a blue collar worker  he had multiple sclerosis  by the time i met him  he could barely walk  in fact  really couldn't walk without two canes  and he'd have to wake up an hour early earlier than everybody else just to get dressed  but he never missed a day on the job  and michelle's mom  she stayed at home when the kids were young and then found a job as a secretary  and that's the work they did all their lives  they had a little second floor apartment that michelle and craig lived in  and yet  despite those modest beginnings  michelle and her brother were able to get the best possible education  and so in these travels that i had in that first campaign  what i was reminded of was that core idea that is central to this country  what makes us exceptional  what makes us great  it's not just how many skyscrapers we have  it's not how powerful our military is  what makes us special is this idea that in this country  if you are willing to work hard  if you're willing to take responsibility for your own life  then you can make it if you try  no matter where you come from  no matter what you look like  no matter what your last name is  no matter how modest your beginnings  you can make it in this country if you work hard  because america has never been a country of handouts  we're a nation of workers and doers and dreamers and risk takers  we work for what we get  and all we ask for as americans is that our hard work pays off  all we ask is that our responsibility is rewarded  so that if we put in enough effort  we can find a job that pays the bills  we can afford a home to call our own  we won't go bankrupt when we get sick  maybe we can take a vacation once in a while with our families  nothing fancy  i was telling folks the other day  when i think about my favorite vacations when i was a kid  when i was   years old my mom  sister  and my grandmom  we traveled across the country  but we didn't fly on jets  we took greyhound buses  took the train sometimes  i think we were in the car twice  stayed at howard johnson's  and the exciting thing for me was if there was any kind of swimming pool  it didn't matter how big it was   i laughter i  and then after you spend the whole day swimming  then you'd go to the vending machine  get a soda and a bucket of ice   i laughter i  but the point was to spend time with folks you loved and enjoy their company  so that was part of it  and then people expect  i think  that they can retire with dignity and respect after a lifetime of work  that's the essence of america  that that is within everybody's grasp  doesn't mean you're not going to have some ups and downs  doesn't mean at some point you're not going to experience tough times  but it does mean that the trajectory of people's lives in this country  if you work hard  you can make it  and that's what made us special  that's what made us the greatest nation on earth  that's what made us an economic superpower  now  when i ran in   a lot of people  we came together not just democrats  but republicans and independents  because we're not democrats or republicans first  we're americans first  and we came together because we felt like that idea had been slipping away for too long  for almost a decade  people had been working harder  but getting less  and then the worst financial crisis in our lifetimes hit  the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes hit  millions of people lost their jobs or lost their homes or lost their savings  and that made the dream that much harder to reach for  but what i've learned over these last   years is that even though the crisis put us through some very tough times  the american people are tougher  folks may have gotten knocked down some  but they got back up  the crisis didn't change who we are  it did not change our fundamental character as a people  it hasn't changed our sense of purpose from   our mission right now  yes  is to put people back to work and  yes  to strengthen the housing market  but our purpose is also to rebuild our economy so that it lasts  so that work pays off  an economy in which everybody  whether you are starting a business or punching a clock  you can have confidence that if you work hard you can get ahead  that's our goal  that's our central purpose  that's what this campaign's about  that's what i've been working on for the last   years  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  i want to say this   i audience member i  we love you  mr  president   i the president i  because i laughter i because we've gone through tough times  i think there's a tendency sometimes for some of the commentators to say  well  this time it's really different  we're losing our number one status  and all this stuff  i don't buy any of that  we're still by far the greatest nation on earth  and what's holding us back from meeting our challenges   i audience member i  congress   i laughter i   i the president i  what's holding us back from meeting our challenges is not a lack of big ideas  it's not technical solutions  you name it  whatever it is education  housing  the deficit we have the solutions in front of us  what's holding us back is we've got a stalemate in washington that has more to do with than just two candidates for president or two political parties  it's two fundamentally different visions about how we move this country forward  this election is about breaking that stalemate  the outcome of this election will determine not just what happens next year or the year after that  but what happens for the next   years  see  my opponent and his allies in congress  they believe in a top down economics  they believe that if we spend trillions of dollars on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy even if we have to pay for it by gutting education or gutting job training programs or gutting investments in basic research or turning medicare into a voucher system or increasing middle class taxes  that if we do that  somehow all of you are going to benefit  that's their idea  they also believe that if we roll back regulations on banks and insurance companies and credit card companies  regulations that are meant to protect people and our economy  that somehow everybody is going to be more secure  that's their basic argument  they'll spend a lot of time talking  but if you cut through all the stuff i laughter i what they're really saying is tax cuts for the wealthy  roll back regulations  that's essentially their plan  now  it is a plan  i mean  i it's a theory  it fits easily on a bumper sticker   i laughter i  but here's the problem  we tried it  we tried it for a decade before i took office  it did not work  we tried it  and we turned a surplus into a deficit  we tried it  and we had the most sluggish job growth in decades  we tried it  and your income and wages on average went down went down even while the cost of health care and education and gas were all going up  and then it culminated in the worst financial crisis that we're still cleaning up after  so it's not as if we haven't tried their theory  it would be one thing if we hadn't tried it  then they could say  well  let's try this  and maybe everybody would say  all right  well  that's worth trying  but we did this  and it didn't work  we can't afford to go back to top down economics  we need somebody who believes in a middle out economics  a bottom up economics  somebody who will fight for you and working people all across virginia and all across america  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  you know  when the american auto industry was about to go under and my opponent was saying  let's  let detroit go bankrupt  i made a bet on american workers  on american ingenuity  and we got management and workers to sit down and work things out  and right now gm is number one again  and the u s  auto industry is back on top  well  let me tell you something  what can happen in the auto industry in detroit  that can happen in manufacturing all across this country  in richmond and in raleigh and in pittsburgh and in cleveland  which is why i've said  let's stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in the united states of america and investing in american workers  so we can make american products stamped with those three proud words  made in america  that's how we build an economy that lasts  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president  mr  romney has got a different idea  he invested in companies that have been called  pioneers  of outsourcing   i laughter i  i don't want a pioneer in outsourcing   i laughter i  i want some insourcing  i want to bring companies back  and part of that is making sure we change our tax code  part of it is investing in basic science and research  we've always been at the cutting edge of technology  we've got to keep that  we've got to maintain that  and you know    years ago i said i would end the war in iraq  because of our veterans  because of our outstanding men and women in uniform  we've been able to keep that promise  we're transitioning out of afghanistan and starting to bring our troops home  so now my attitude is  after a decade of war  let's take half of those savings on war and let's use that to reduce our deficit  let's use the other half to do some nation building here at home  let's put folks back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our railroads and our schools and putting broadband lines into rural communities all across america  that's how we build an economy that lasts  that's also  by the way  how we take care of our veterans  now that they're coming home  they shouldn't have to fight for a job after they fought for us  and they should get the benefits that they've earned  so we'll be fighting any kind of cutbacks on veteran services  we've got to take care of folks who took care of us  i'm running to make sure that our kids get the best education in the world  i want to help our schools hire and reward the best teachers  especially math and science  i want to give   million more americans the chance to go to community colleges  get trained for the jobs that are that folks are hiring for right now  i want colleges and universities to bring down tuition so young people aren't burdened with debt  higher education isn't a luxury  it is a necessity in this  st century  i want to make sure that middle class families can refinance their homes  save   a year  that's good for you  but it's also good for businesses  because you'll spend that money  i'm running because i believe we've got to keep going on the affordable care act  it was the right thing to do to make sure that everybody has health care  the supreme court has spoken  it is the law of the land  we are going to implement it  and because we're implementing it  young people can stay on their parents' health insurance plans until they're   years old  and if you've got health insurance  the only thing that's going to happen is you've got more security and insurance companies can't jerk you around  and   million people  including those with preexisting conditions  can finally get health insurance  it was the right thing to do  we're not going backwards  we're going forwards  i'm wrapping up   i laughter i  but you're all everybody's wet anyway  so it doesn't matter   i laughter i  it's too late  those hairdos are all gone   i laughter i  now   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  let me talk about one last thing  and that is the deficit and the debt  because the other side  they'll say  well  you know  this is the most important issue  and what i've said is  you know what  along with putting people back to work  we do need to bring down our deficit and our debt  after a decade of irresponsibility  where i inherited a trillion dollar deficit  i'm ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work  we've already cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending that we don't need  i'm willing to do more  because not every program works  government can't solve every problem  government can't help somebody if they don't want to help themselves  it doesn't matter how much money we put into schools if  parents  you're not telling your kids they need to work hard in school  but what i'm not willing to do is what my opponent proposes  which is pretend like you're lowering the deficit and then cut taxes for folks like me by   trillion on top of the bush tax cuts  because we can't afford it  what i've said to congress is let's make sure that everybody who's making   a year or less  that your taxes don't go up  that's   percent of americans  but let's ask folks like me who can afford it  the top   percent  to do a little bit more so that we can still help young people go to college  so that we don't turn medicare into a voucher system  so that we're still investing in basic research  so that we can still build roads and help folks with the housing situation  and by the way  we've tried that too  a guy named bill clinton tried it  and we created   million new jobs  and we had surpluses instead of deficits  and by the way  rich people did just fine back then   i laughter i  here's the thing i think the other side doesn't understand  when working people do well  everybody does well  that means businesses have more customers  that is how we grow an economy  not by everybody just looking out for themselves  but by all of us coming together and working hard  whether all these things  whether it's bringing manufacturing back  putting construction workers back to work  protecting health care  making sure our kids get the best education  caring for our veterans  all these things that make up a middle class life  they all tie together  they're all central to that idea that if you work hard you can get ahead  that's the promise that our parents and our grandparents and our great grandparents made to future generations  some of them came here as immigrants  some came here not wanting to come  but i laughter i when they got here  all of us whether they were working on farms or whether they were working in mines or working in on you know  in a factory that idea that if i work hard now  things will be better for my kids  that's what built this country  and over the next   months  the other side's going to spend more money than we've ever seen in our lifetimes on a bunch of negative ads  and they're going to try to peddle this economic theory that everybody knows we tried and didn't work  and since they know that probably is not going to sell  really what these ads are going to do is just say  the economy isn't where it needs to be  and it's obama's fault  that's their message  they'll use all those scary voices in the ads and i laughter i but that's basically their message  and that's a plan for maybe winning an election  but it's not a plan for creating jobs or helping the middle class  it's not a plan for rebuilding our economy  and so i don't worry about the kind of money they're spending because what you taught me in   same thing i learned in my first campaign  was that when ordinary folks come together when they cut through all the nonsense and they remember what makes this country great  they tap into those core american values and they remember what's true about our lives when you come together  nothing can stop you  when you come together  change happens  when you come together  people get a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same set of rules when you decide  and that's the choice you have now in this election  so i have to tell you  when i ran in   i tried to make sure that any promise i made  i could keep  so i said i'd end the war in iraq  we ended the war  i said i'd keep your taxes down  and i've lowered taxes for middle class families    on average  if somebody tells you i've raised their taxes  tell them that ain't right   i laughter i  it's just not true  but the main promise i made to you  i said i wasn't a perfect man and i you can ask michelle that  and she'll i laughter i and i told you i wouldn't be a perfect president  but i told you that i'd always tell you what i thought  i'd always tell you where i stood  even sometimes it wasn't popular  but i'd tell you what i thought  what i believed  and i'd also wake up every single day fighting as hard as i knew how for you  to make your lives a little bit better  and you know what  i've kept that promise  i've kept that promise  because i see myself in you  when i see your grandparents  i see my grandparents  when i see my children  i see your children  we are in this together  we rise and fall as one nation  i still believe in you  and if you still believe in me and you stand up with me and make phone calls and knock on doors and get out there and organize with me  we're going to finish what we started in   we're going to win this election  we're going to win virginia  we're going to put this country on the right track  and we'll remind the world just why it is that the american way is what is the envy of the world and we are the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  cincinnati  well  it is good to be back  everybody  please have a seat if you've got a seat   i laughter i  i think most people have a seat here  it is great to see all of you  i want to acknowledge first of all

that's it   i laughter i  now  today   i audience member i  are you going to sing   i the president i  no  i'm not going to sing   i laughter i  no al green  today we are turning this beautiful music hall into a town hall  so i'm not going to take too much time up front  i want to spend as much time as possible answering some of your questions and getting your comments  but i do want to just say a few things about what's at stake here  four years ago  we came together democrats  but also independents and republicans  who were interested in restoring the basic bargain that made america the greatest nation on earth  we've got so much to be thankful for  incredible land and an incredible military  our men and women in uniform  they do so much for us all the time  and there's obviously great wealth in this nation  but what really sets us apart has always been that we've got the greatest middle class and a basic idea that's at the heart of this country that says if you work hard  then you can get ahead  if you're responsible  then you can live out your dreams  you're not confined to the circumstances of your birth  a basic belief that if you're doing what you need to do because we're not a country that believes in handouts  we believe in working for what we get that you're able to find a job that supports a family  get a home that you can call your own  that you're able to send your kids to get a good education and  hopefully  allow them to go to college and they can achieve and succeed in ways you might not have even imagined  that you won't go bankrupt when you get sick  that you'll be able to retire with dignity and respect  that's the idea that built this country  that's the idea that turned us into a economic powerhouse  and what we saw for about a decade before i took office was the sense that that dream was slipping away from too many people  because people were working harder  but they were getting less  incomes and wages were flatlining  while the cost of everything from college to health care to groceries to gas were all going up  so our goal was to turn this around  and we knew it wouldn't be easy  we knew that it might take more than one term  maybe more than one president  but we knew that we had to get started to reclaim this dream  and then  what we discovered was that because of irresponsibility  because of economic policies that had failed and a lack of oversight when it came to regulations  we inherited the worst financial crisis and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  and millions of people were hurt  lost their jobs  lost their homes  lost their savings  and a lot of folks are still struggling  but here's the thing  americans are always tougher than tough times  and this crisis has not changed our character  it hasn't changed what we believe in  it hasn't changed that basic notion that everybody should get a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same set of rules  and so even though over the last   years  our central focus has been how do we recover from this crisis and get people back to work and make sure that small businesses are doing well again and that they're getting financing despite all those things our goal has not just been to get back to where we were before the crisis struck  but rather to build an economy that lasts  to build an economy that says no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your last name is  you can make it if you try here in america  everything i've done since i've been president has been focused on this central issue  that's the reason i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  and you know what  part of the reason i'm here today   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president   i part of the reason that i'm here today is i want to remind everybody that the challenges we face are solvable  the problem is not a lack of big ideas  it's not a lack of technical solutions to our policy issues  the problem is we've got a stalemate right now in washington   i audience members i  yes   i the president i between two fundamentally different ideas about how we move the country forward  this election is about more than just two candidates or two political parties  it's about two different visions about how do we build a strong economy  and the good news is you're the tiebreaker  the choice is up to you   i applause i  the choice is up to you  governor romney and his allies in congress  they believe in an economic theory that says  if folks at the very top are doing really well  then that spreads to everybody else  it's what we call top down economics  so right now their main prescription for growing the economy faster is an additional   trillion in tax cuts  most of which would go to the wealthiest americans  even if to pay for it you'd have to gut education programs or turn medicare into a voucher program or eliminate our investments in basic research and science  that's their vision about how you grow an economy  they've actually got a two part vision  one is tax cuts for the wealthy  and then  the second is eliminate regulations that we've put in place to make sure  for example  that wall street doesn't engage in the same reckless behavior that got us into this mess in the first place  now  i've got to tell you  it would be one thing if they had this theory and we hadn't tried it before  but the truth is we tried it for almost a decade  and it didn't work  the track record of their vision resulted in turning surpluses into deficits  we ran two wars on a credit card  job growth was the most sluggish it'd been in decades  the average wages and income of working families actually went down during this period  and it culminated in this massive crisis  so i don't know about you  but in my life  what i found  sometimes i do boneheaded things  i make mistakes  what i find is when i don't when i try something and it doesn't work  then i don't try it again  right  you don't go back to doing something that didn't work  now  i've got a different idea  so for example  governor romney said he would extend the tax cuts for the wealthiest americans indefinitely   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  he says that until he puts a tax plan in place  but his tax plan is not just to keep all the bush tax cuts  as i said  he wants to put another   trillion this is estimated that it's almost impossible for you to bring down the deficit and deal with the debt with that kind of tax plan  nearly   percent of these new taxes would go to the top   percent of all households  we have not found any serious economic study that says governor romney's economic plan would actually create jobs until today  i've got to be honest  today we found out there's a new study out by nonpartisan economists that says governor romney's economic plan would  in fact  create   jobs  there's only one problem  the jobs wouldn't be in america   i laughter i  they would not be in america  they'd be in other countries  by eliminating taxes on corporations' foreign income  governor romney's plan would actually encourage companies to shift more of their operations to foreign tax havens  creating   jobs in those other countries  now  this shouldn't be a surprise  because governor romney's experience has been investing in what were called  pioneers  of the business of outsourcing  now he wants to give more tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  so i want everybody to understand  ohio  i've got a different theory  we don't need a president who plans to ship more jobs overseas or wants to give more tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in ohio  that are investing in cincinnati  that are investing in hamilton county  i want to give incentives to companies that are investing in you  the american people  to create american jobs  making american goods that we're selling around the world  stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  now  the difference extends not just to the difference in corporate taxes  it's also individual taxes  we don't need a president who is going to give himself a big tax break   i laughter i  we need a president who is going to cut your taxes  now    years ago  i promised to cut taxes for the middle class  and i kept that promise   i audience members i  yes  you did   i the president i  the typical family's tax burden is   lower than it was when i came into office  i want all the press to notice that  because sometimes  you'll hear all these crazy accusations   oh  obama  is raising taxes  burdening no  here are the facts  typical middle class family  your taxes have gone down   since i've been in office  a couple weeks ago  i called on congress to immediately extend these tax cuts to   percent of the american people  folks making   a year or less would not see their taxes go up one single dime their income taxes go up one single dime  now  i should point out  by the way  that   percent of small businesses also would not see their taxes go up  because typically  they don't earn more than   now  if you're fortunate enough to be the other   percent and i am i didn't michelle and i didn't use to be  now we are  we've been blessed  that's great  what we're saying is for those folks  we can afford to pay a little bit more in taxes by going back to the rates that were paid under bill clinton  that will help us reduce our deficit by about a trillion dollars  and everybody says the deficit and the debt are important  and i agree  and i just want to point out  the last time we did that  when bill clinton was president  we had surpluses  not deficits  created   million new jobs  and by the way  we created a lot of millionaires and billionaires to boot  because when an economy is growing from the middle out and from the bottom up  everybody does well  including people at the very top  that's how you grow an economy  when teachers and firefighters and police officers and construction workers when folks who are putting in a hard day's work when they do well  then everybody does well  that's how america has always succeeded  we believe in individual initiative and self reliance  but there's some things we do together  and growing an economy is one of them  my grandfather  he went to college on the gi bill  that generation helped to expand the middle class  and everybody did better  when we invested in the hoover dam or the golden gate bridge or the internet  sending a man to the moon  all those things benefited everybody  and so that's the vision that i want to carry forward  that's why when the auto industry was on the brink of collapse and governor romney said  let's let detroit go bankrupt  i said no  one out of eight jobs in ohio depend on the auto industry  a million jobs across the midwest are at stake  i'm going to bet on american workers and american ingenuity  and now gm is back on top  and chrysler and ford are on the move  and the american auto industry has come roaring back  so let me just close by saying this  and then  we can get to some questions  my vision says we're going to invest in education and we're going to hire new teachers  especially in math and science  open up   million more slots for folks to go to community colleges to get trained in the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  we already helped to make sure that students student loan rates didn't double  but now we've got to work more to lower tuition costs so young people aren't burdened with debt  so we're going to invest in education  we're going to invest in american energy  yes  we want to continue to expand our production of oil and natural gas  but i also want to make sure that we are the leaders in solar and wind and biodiesel  the energy of the future that can help reduce our dependence on foreign oil  american manufacturing  change our tax code  provide incentives for companies to invest here  invest in basic research and science so that we are at the cutting edge  because whoever has got the best technology will ultimately have the best economy  we've got to make those investments  rebuilding our infrastructure i know you've got some bridges around here that need repair  you've got some roads that need a repair  let's put construction workers back to work  i ended the war in iraq as i promised  we're winding down the war in afghanistan  we've decimated al qaida  let's now take half the money we were spending on war and do some nation building right here at home   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  and finally  let's reduce our deficit  reduce our debt  let's do it in a responsible way that allows us to continue to make these investments we need to grow and make sure that everybody is doing a little bit to help not just themselves  but help the country  so that's my vision  and it contrasts with the other side  and you are going to be the tiebreaker  this is going to be your choice  that's how our democracy works  and some of you noticed  there's going to be a lot of paid advertising and a lot of money  we're seeing folks write   million checks   i audience members i  that's not us   i the president i to try to get me out of office  so it's not you  i know   i laughter i  but even though my hair is a little grayer i laughter i even though i'm a little older  let me tell you  i still have as much confidence as i ever had in the american people  because one of the great privileges of being president is you get a chance to travel all across the country  you meet people from every walk of life  and wherever i go  what i'm always struck by is the core decency and goodness and hard work and responsibility and faith that the american people have  so i'll always bet on the american people  and i'm confident that if we work hard  we get our message out  we have an honest debate about what needs to happen in this country and what future is best for our children and our grandchildren  then we're going to finish what we started in   and we'll remind the world why the united states is the greatest nation on earth  thank you very much  everybody  thank you  all right  okay  so everybody take a seat so i can see who wants to ask a question  and there are no there are only a couple of rules here  rule number one is you've got to raise your hand if you have a question  i'm going to call girl boy  girl boy i laughter i just to make sure that it's fair  if you have a chance  stand up and introduce yourself  and there are folks in the audience with microphones  so wait until we've got a microphone so everybody can hear your question  and my only other request  because i want to try to get in as many questions as i can at least six or seven so if people can keep their questions short  i'll try to keep my answers short   i laughter i  but  now  if you ask me how do you bring about world peace  that's a big question   i laughter i  so try to keep the question to one that we can be succinct about  all right  and i'm going to start with this young lady right here in the  sort of  the pink  white blouse  yes  right there  all right  and wait till the microphone comes up  introduce yourself   i q   i can you stand with me   i the president i  oh  is that the birthday boy   i q i  yes   i the president i  okay  i didn't he's getting a lot of attention today   i laughter i  all right  go ahead   i civil rights of lesbian  gay  bisexual  and transgendered persons  i i q   i okay  my name is anna  and my son is openly gay  and he is grassroots  and he speaks for a lot of the lgbt community  and we'd like to know  since you are for the lgbt  what's your next steps  what are you going to do for us   i the president i  well  look  let me say this  first of all  i think what the american people have seen and made such progress on is recognizing the idea of equal rights  equal dignity  equal respect for everybody  that applies to everybody  that is a bedrock principle of america  and that's when i came into office  everything from making sure that same sex couples could have visitation in hospitals just like everybody else  making sure that we ended  don't ask  don't tell  because fighting for the country you love should not depend on who you love  being clear that doma is something that we should repeal across the board i've tried to constantly align myself with what is best in our tradition  and that is  you treat everybody fairly  americans are about fairness  and that doesn't mean that folks have to agree with everybody on everything  we don't  but we want to treat everybody fairly  now  i think it's important to recognize  though  that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters are still subject to discrimination  that's why we passed hate crime legislation  and we've still got to fight for that  i think it is important for us to respect decisions that states make with respect to expanding treatment of same sex couples and marriage  but also what i want to say is that gay and lesbian families are like everybody else  what they're really also worried about right now is making sure they can pay the bills  so my strong belief is that it is important for us to focus on individual issues of fairness  but also recognize that we all have common interests as well  your son is   i'm assuming he's going to get some more education  and i'm assuming you guys are worrying right now about making sure he doesn't come out with a whole bunch of debt  and how   i q   i miami   i the president i  miami   i q   i miami   i the president i  miami of ohio   i q   i yes   i the president i  outstanding  congratulations  we've got some folks from the alma mater here  so we want to treat everybody fairly  and we also want to make sure that the economy treats everybody fairly  and i'm going to be fighting for that as long as i'm president of the united states  all right  this gentleman right here  does anybody have a mike over there  okay  right behind very good  i'm impressed  there you go   i oil and gas production environmental protection  i i q   i mr  president  i'm jim o'reilly  ten years as an elected city official has shown me a real change in what the republican party has been doing to us  they've taken away our power to protect our natural resources water and air from the strength of the oil and gas drillers that are doing fracking here in ohio  i support what lisa jackson and the epa are doing  is there more the administration can do to protect us from the adverse effects of drilling for natural gas  thank you   i the president i  good  well  this is a great question  and it's an important question  a couple of things i just want everybody to know  first of all  if you hear anybody say that somehow we are impeding the development of our energy resources here in this nation  i want you to know these facts  oil production  higher than it's been in   years  natural gas production  higher than it's been probably in our lifetimes  oil imports  actually lower than they've been in   years  in fact  our oil imports are less than   percent now for the first time in a very long time  and so we're moving in the right direction in terms of energy independence  now  part of that is this boom in natural gas  and this is something we should welcome  because not only are we blessed with incredible natural gas resources that are now accessible because of new technologies  but natural gas actually burns cleaner than some other fossil fuels and is an ideal fuel energy source that we potentially can use for the next   years  so i want to encourage natural gas production  the key is to make sure that we do it safely and in a way that is environmentally sound  now  you always hear these arguments that somehow there's this huge contradiction between the environment and economic development or the environment and energy production  and the fact of the matter is that there are a lot of folks right now that are engaging in hydraulic fracking who are doing it safely  the problem is  is that we haven't established clear guidelines for how to do it safely and informed the public so that neighbors know what's going on  and your family  you can make sure that any industry that's operating in your area  that they're being responsible  so what we've said is  look  we are going to work with industry to establish best practices  we are going to invest in the basic research and science required to make sure this is done safely and in a way that protects the public health  and for responsible companies  they should be able to operate  make a profit  and we can all benefit and put people back to work  but if you're an irresponsible company that's not doing the right thing  we're going to hold you to account  and that's how we should develop this incredible resource  which  by the way  if we do it properly  could end up changing the economics and politics globally of energy in a way that's actually very good for us  because we'll be less dependent on what happens in the middle east and our economy will be less subject to the kinds of spikes that we saw earlier in the spring in terms of gas prices  thank you for the question  all right  it's a woman's turn  that young lady in the white t shirt right there  hold on  hold on  wait for the mike   i q   i my name is delicia white  and i and my husband  we're small business owners  and he actually has a question that he needs to answer   i laughter i   i the president i  well  wait  no  no  you can't do that now   i laughter i  i called on the young lady  and that's what's called a bait and switch   i laughter i  that is what's called a bait and switch  no  the rule is that i'm going to make sure that women get equal time with men   i applause i  ah  see that   i q   i well  we would like   i the president i  oh  no  no  no   i laughter i   i q   i okay  his questions was  he is a small business owner  and he wanted to know what can you do for the self employed for self employed businesses with less than   employees working with him   i the president i  okay  here's what i'm going to do  i'm going to let him go ahead and ask his question   i laughter i  and then  i'm going to call on two women in a row  because this is we got cheated here   i laughter i  go ahead  next time  you stand up  don't send your wife out first   i laughter i   i small business promotion efforts  i i q   i okay  i'm tony white  and hello  mr  president   i the president i  good to see you  tony  what kind of business do you have   i q   i a barbershop and beauty salon   i the president i  there you go   i q   i i've been in business for over   years now   i the president i  that's great   i q   i and what i'm trying to find out is  what will you be doing  or if there's anything you'll be doing  for the self employed and businesses under  with employees with less than   employees   i the president i  absolutely   i q   i and also  when can i cut your hair   i laughter i   i the president i  well  first of all  let me answer the second question first  you know that you would not want a president who is disloyal to his barber   i laughter i  right  i mean  a man and his barber  that's a strong connection   i laughter i   i q   i i know  i know   i the president i  so i am not going to let you cut my hair because my barber would be hurt   i laughter i   i q   i just one time  just one time   i laughter i   i the president i  maybe i'll let you give me a line  a little bit   i q   i yes  yes  we can do that   i laughter i   i the president i  all right  in terms of small business  look  small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy  they account for most of the new job growth  we've got obviously great big businesses  in this area  proctor gamble is an example of an outstanding large business  but a lot of the job growth happens with small businesses  who then become medium sized businesses and then maybe at some point become large businesses  so ever since i came into office  one of my biggest priorities was how do we support small businesses  which is why we've actually provided   different tax breaks just targeted at small business since i've been in office  it's the reason why we have pushed the small business administration  especially when the recession had just hit  to extend additional financing and to waive fees for small business  because one of the biggest challenges for small businesses is getting credit lines   i q   i yes  it is   i the president i  and we've actually been pushing the banks to say  look  taxpayers pulled your backside out of the fire  it's now important for you to step up and make sure that small businesses aren't finding their credit restricted  especially if they've been in business for a while  the other thing we've done is to say  what are the critical needs of small business  a lot of times  one of the biggest challenges is to make sure that you  as a sole proprietor  that you can get health insurance for you and your family  so when you hear about the affordable care act obamacare and i don't mind the name because i really do care  that's why we passed it  you should know that you  once we have fully implemented  you're going to be able to buy insurance through a pool so that you can get the same good rates as a group that  if you're an employee at a big company  you can get right now  which means your premiums will go down  we will also give you additional tax credits if you are providing health insurance for your employees  we'll give you tax credits for that  right now one of the things we're pushing congress to do is to give you a tax credit if you hire additional workers or you give folks who are a working for you a raise  we want to give you incentive to do that  but this is an example of where there's a contrast between myself and my opponent  as i said before  his basic tax plan is to give folks at the top a tax break  now  we can have that debate  but what i've said is  in the meantime  let's give   percent of individuals and   percent of small businesses some certainty right now by going ahead and passing a law that says your taxes won't go up  because if congress doesn't act  by the way  by january   everybody's taxes here are going to go up  by an average of about  if congress doesn't do anything  and so what i've said is if you really want to help small business right now  give   percent of them the certainty that their costs will not go up  and then  we can have a debate about the other     percent  now  one last point i'm going to make on this small business and taxes argument  you'll hear republicans say  you know what  if you tax  let's say  somebody with a million dollars of income  you're going to be crushing the small business jobs creators  now  first of all  i've just explained   percent of small businesses make less than   a year  but setting aside that  the way they describe small businesses  half of the fortune   richest americans in the country would qualify as a  small business  hedge fund managers would qualify as small business  even if they were pulling in a billion dollars a year  and my this is an example of what i mean when i say we just want everybody to be treated fairly   i audience members i  right   i the president i  michelle and i were talking the other day  and michelle's dad worked as a blue collar worker  he was at the water filtration plant in chicago  worked there all his life all his adult life  and he had ms  so by the time i met him  he could barely walk  but he never missed a day of work  he had to use two canes  he had to wake up an hour earlier than everybody else just to get dressed  but he never missed a day of work  and he took pride in being at the job  even if he didn't feel well  and he used to tease folks who were lazy  he'd say  these people are so lazy they won't even go to work to pick up their paycheck   i laughter i  they want it mailed to them  and michelle's mom  she stayed at home when the kids were young  and then  she went to work as a secretary  and she worked as a secretary most of her adult life  so the point is  they didn't have a lot  but michelle and i were talking about how they didn't envy people who had a lot more  there was no sense that somehow our lives are less because we're not millionaires  we're not making huge amounts of money  god bless folks who are doing successful who are successful and doing well  the only thing that michelle's parents  my mom  my grandparents  the only thing they didn't like is when you felt like folks at the top were taking advantage of their position and not following the same rules as everybody else and keeping other folks down  and we don't want an economy in which some are being treated differently than others  that's all  and that's especially true when it comes for our small business folks  i want them to have some of the same advantages  because you probably can't afford the same number of lawyers and accountants and all that stuff that are working all these loopholes  and i want to make sure that you're getting the same good deal as everybody else  all right  okay  i'm going to call on this young lady right here  she seems like she has an urgent question  hold on  wait for your mike  wait for your microphone  we're getting the next generation involved in this  right here  right there  yes   i girl scouts of america girl scout cookies  i i q   i what's your favorite girl scout cookie   i the president i  oh  oh  i've got to say this is one of the toughest questions   i laughter i  what's your name   i q   i julie   i the president i  and you're a member of a girl scout troop  are you   i q   i yes   i the president i  how long have you been a girl scout   i q   i i think for only i think only this year   i the president i  this year  have you   i q   i two years   i the president i  two years  have you been having fun   i q   i yes   i the president i  yes  you know  i've got to say that i'm pretty partial to those mint   i audience members   i thin mints  yes  thin mints i applause i   i audience member   i boo   i the president i  i'm just saying that's just me  i didn't mean to create controversy here  there was someone i laughter i did you hear there was somebody booing  what do you how do you what's was your choice  who was booing up there   i laughter i  you had a different opinion  what are you  oatmeal or   i audience members i  peanut butter   i the president i  okay  peanut butter is quite good too  but i'm going with the mint  i'm going with the mint  all right  thank you for the question  thank you  all right  remember i said i was going to go two ladies right now  so here  right here  right here  here we go  go ahead  whoops  don't fall  now  go ahead   i q   i my name is susan  welcome to cincinnati   i the president i  thank you   i  presidential and congressional elections  i i q   i given how divided the country is  if elected  how do you plan to try to unite everyone   i the president i  well  i'll be honest  sometimes people ask me what's my disappointment since i've come into office  and obviously  we're always trying to grow the economy faster  put people back to work faster  but one of the disappointments i've had is that we have not changed the tone in washington the way i wanted to  now  part of this just has to do with the fact that the other side had a basic economic or a basic political theory after i got elected and this is not my opinion  i mean  this has been said by the leader of the senate minority in washington  and the basic theory was  you know what  we kind of screwed things up  obama is really popular right now  if we cooperate with him  then he'll get credit  so we're better off just saying no  and if we do that  then over time  folks will forget the mess he inherited and we can go after him  and hopefully  that will help our politics  again  this is not my theory  this is explicitly their strategy  what's true is also we've got  as i said  two different visions about how to move the country forward  but my hope is that this election allows us to  once and for all  resolve some of the bigger questions about how we move the country forward  because right now we've got as stark a choice as you could imagine  i believe in investing in education and transportation and science and research and bringing down our deficits in a balanced way  and changing our tax code to make sure that companies that are investing here are doing better  mr  romney has the opposite view on almost all those positions  on things like  don't ask  don't tell  mr  romney wants to reverse my position  on issues like immigration  i believe in comprehensive immigration reform  he does not  on issues related to women  i believe that planned parenthood does a lot of good  and that women's health women should be able to control their own health care decisions  he does not  on iraq  he said me ending the war was  tragic  i said i think it was the right thing to do  on afghanistan  i imposed a deadline  a timetable for when we're going to bring our troops home  he wants to extend their stay indefinitely  so on all these issues  we've got just profound differences  now  you guys ultimately are the arbiters of this disagreement  and in this election  if the american people decide you know what  we want to try what mr  romney is offering   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  i mean  that's the great thing about democracy  is people can vote and make up their minds  and so if that's the case  then you can count on mr  romney implementing the plan that he and the republicans in congress have put forward  so   trillion in tax cuts  massive cuts in a lot of the programs that are so important  from my perspective  to growing the economy  those will be eliminated  medicare will be voucherized  they will implement what they say they're going to implement  but if i'm elected  not only do i think that we'll be able to continue the progress that we've made over the last   years  i actually think that a lot of republicans  since this will be my last election  they will not be as interested in just beating me and maybe they'll be more interested in moving the country forward  that's my hope  and i have to say  the truth is on most of these issues  there shouldn't be so much partisan rancor  because most of the positions i've taken are positions that used to be supported by republicans  and if you want just one good example  health care  the bill i passed is in all respects similar to what mr  romney passed in massachusetts  it's working really well there  he should be proud of it instead of running away from it  and the original idea of using the private sector to make sure that everybody had health care  that originated as a republican idea  and i said  fine  i'm willing to work with your ideas to make progress  so i actually think that there are a number of republican members of congress who right now feel as if they've got to toe the party line  but if the objective is no longer just beating me  my hope is that they'll be more open to finding commonsense solutions to the problems that our country faces  and i know that is absolutely a goal of mine  because in the end  we are not democrats or republicans first  we are americans first  that's what i believe  all right  i've got time for two more questions  this gentleman in the blue shirt right there  all right  i'll end over here  come on   i laughter i  go ahead   i education  i i q   i mr  president  my name is jeff whitesell  and i have been teaching for   years   i the president i  congratulations   i q   i thank you  i teach at a vocational school  career tech school  and my question to you is  we've been talking about jobs  we've been talking about kids  we're talking about i know you want every kid to go to college  but not every kid is going to go to college  we need people to work  we need people to be plumbers and build bridges and those kind of things  and what i want to i applause i i believe it  i really do  we do miracles at our school  we take kids who have had really rough lives and we make them productive  but the problem is  is that they are not getting enough chances to get to go to work right away  we have advisory boards  but these advisory boards are free  and they're these people are not getting paid  what we need and i was hoping that you could tell us if this is something in your agenda can we have people come in  give tax breaks to these companies to come and help schools to teach the schools what they really need for these kids  and that's what i that's what we're looking for   i the president i  well  first of all  thank you for teaching  most important job there is  we appreciate that  second of all  i want to be very clear  when i say everybody needs a higher education  i don't mean everybody has got to take a  year college education  the point is that  these days  if you want to be a plumber  if you want to be an electrician  you want to be working in a factory  you are generally going to need a little bit more training than high school provides  which is why our community college system is so important  but you are absolutely right that one of the  i believe  mistakes we made     years ago was to start deemphasizing vocational education  because not everybody wants to sit in a classroom with a book  a lot of folks want to do stuff  and right now we've got shortages of folks in fields that need technical training  but don't necessarily require a  year college degree  and so part of what i'm talking to secretary of education arne duncan about is how do we work with high schools so that young people who've got an aptitude whether it's in graphic design or in electronics  or you name it that they can start getting on a pathway so that they are being trained for the jobs that actually exist now  they're being matched up with companies that are hiring now  they maybe start apprenticing junior  senior year in high school  maybe it extends to another year or two in community college  and by the time they're       they are expert in fields where we know there is hiring taking place right now  so it's very important  we're going to be working with states  local governments  school districts  and community colleges to try to figure out how we can expand what is already a proven idea in a lot of places around the country  and so  you and i  we're right there  we're thinking the same way  and i'm looking forward to seeing if we can make progress on this  all right  last question  i promised no  i'm going to call on this young lady right here  all right  this is the last question  and we got to get a mike to her  but it's nice to see you  young man   i laughter i  that's a good looking young man  isn't he  he's a handsome young guy   i laughter i  all right  go ahead   i unemployment rate job creation  i i q   i hi  my father  he's an unemployed construction worker  and he's on unemployment  so as your job as president  will he have a job before his unemployment runs out   i the president i  well  no  this is an important question  what's your name   i q   i taylor   i the president i  taylor  how old are you  taylor   i q   i i will be   in   months   i the president i  well  so nice to meet you  and i'm glad you're thinking about your dad  because i know he wants to work   i audience member i  that's my granddaughter   i the president i  my hope is  is that we can put him to work  housing took the biggest hit in our economy because you had this big housing bubble that collapsed  so the construction industry  the industry where your dad works  was the hardest hit of any industry  and it's the one that's been the slowest to come back  which is why  since september of last year  i have urged congress to expand our efforts to rebuild roads  bridges  schools  laying broadband lines going into rural communities  making sure that all these folks  like your father  who want to work these aren't folks who are looking for a handout  they want to be on the job so that they have an opportunity to do work that we're going to have to do anyway  and this is important  how many folks here have a house and you know that you've got a leaky roof  do you you can put off patching up that leaky roof  but sooner or later  you're going to have to patch it up  sooner or later  and if you don't  what happens   i audience member i  falls in   i the president i  it falls in  and then what happens  it's more expensive  same is true if you got a busted boiler  so we all have what's called deferred maintenance  we can't always do it right away  but a lot of times  if we have an opportunity to do it  we should go ahead and do it  especially if it's cheap  it is cheaper now to do it than it will be later  interest rates are low  construction workers are out of work  contractors are begging for work  they'll come in on time  under budget  and so we could knock out a whole bunch of work that needs to get done for this country anyway and put people back to work  which would grow the economy right now  now  so far  i have not gotten a positive response from members of congress on the other side of the aisle  they did just pass and this was a sign of some modest cooperation  so it makes me feel a little bit encouraged they did just pass a transportation bill that at least wouldn't lay off more construction workers  but the first thing i want to do was put your dad back on the job rebuilding america  now  if your father still doesn't get a job  though  part of what i'm also looking for is making sure that unemployment insurance is there for folks who want to work  but are having trouble finding work  and i want folks to be clear  unemployment insurance  unemployment benefits  they're paid for  your employer paid for them  directly and indirectly  you paid for them  the idea is to have that safety net because everybody once in a while can have some bad luck  now  we tried to extend unemployment insurance beyond normal right after the recession hit  we were able to extend it again in   it's been harder now to get congress to extend it further  and i don't know exactly what category your father falls in  but my bottom line is  my general view is that as long as the economy is weak and somebody is willing and able to work  and looking for work actively which is what's required if you want to get unemployment insurance then we should be there for them to make sure that they can pay the rent and look after their families  and so we'll continue to negotiate with congress to make sure that unemployment is there  but the most important thing i want to do is make sure your dad can get a job  all right  let me just say  everybody  i am going to be back in cincinnati  i'm going to be back in ohio  i want to thank you for your attention  and i want to explicitly ask you for your support  this is going to be a close election  this is going to be a close election  and it is going to be an important debate  and i want everybody to understand that what i've tried to do over the last   years is to keep my promises  so i promised i'd end the war in iraq  i ended it  i promised that we would keep taxes low for middle class families  i did that  but the most important promise i made some of you remember me saying this in  i said  you know i'm not a perfect man  i said  i wasn't going to be a perfect president  no president is  but what i promised you was that i would always tell you what i thought  i'd always tell you what i believed  and i would wake up every single day fighting as hard as i knew how for you  and you know what  i have kept that promise  because when i look around this room  if i see an elderly couple i think about my grandparents and everything they did for me  and when i see this young lady asking about her dad  i think about my daughters  i see myself in you  and my most important job is fighting for you and that basic american idea that if you work hard in this country  you can succeed  you can get ahead  and i'm going to do everything i can  as long as i have the honor of being president  to fight for you and working families and middle class families all across this country  so i hope you'll stand with me  i hope you'll work with me  let's finish what we started and remind the world why the united states is the great nation that it is  god bless you and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  texas  it is good to be back in austin  texas  yeah  it's good to be back  love austin  texas  how's everybody doing today  couple of people i want to acknowledge  first of all  your fine mayor of this fine city  lee leffingwell is here  we've got an out of town guest who is doing outstanding work in another part of texas  the mayor of houston  annise parker is here  somebody who is fighting on behalf of working people every single day  congressman lloyd doggett is here  and give it up for the outstanding entertainment provided by jerry jeff walker  and thanks to all of you for being here  i am excited to be back   i audience member i  i love you   i the president i  i love you back  i do  now  texas  let me tell you  this is my last campaign   i audience members i  aww   i the president i  no  it's true  unless i move down here to austin maybe i i applause i run for dogcatcher down here or something   i laughter i  this is most likely my last campaign  win or lose  and it makes you   i audience members i  win   i the president i  and it makes you nostalgic about your first campaign and the first few campaigns i ran back in my home state of illinois   i audience members i  whoo   i the president i   i laughter i  illinois in the house  now  back then  understand  i did not have air force one   i laughter i  i didn't have marine one  i didn't have the beast driving me around  i drove myself around  and illinois is a big state  so we'd i'd go up and down i'd usually have one staff person with me  a lot of times  i'd be the one driving  and we didn't even have mapquest back then  so you had to unfold the map i laughter i and try to figure out how it folds back  and we'd get lost  and but when i think back to those times  those early campaigns  we'd travel to inner city communities and rural communities and suburban communities  and you'd meet folks from every walk of life  black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  wealthy  low income  and what was fascinating was that everywhere you went  there was a common theme  a common thread  i'd see an elderly couple and i'd think about my grandparents  my grandfather  who fought in world war ii  and my grandmother  who worked on a bomber assembly line while he was gone  and when he came back  he was able to get a college education on the gi bill  and they were able to buy a home with the help of an fha loan  and i'd think about the journey they traveled and how remarkable that was and how that represented all that the greatest generation had done  and then i'd meet a single mom somewhere and i'd think about my mom  who basically raised me and my sister on her own because my father left  and how she had to struggle to work while she was putting herself through school and still keep us on track  and yet she was because of the help of scholarships and grants able to get her education and then give me and my sister the best education in the world  and i thought about how that couldn't happen probably in most places around the world  and then i'd meet a working couple somewhere and i'd think about michelle's parents  michelle's dad had ms  so by the time i met him  he could barely walk  he had to use two canes  and he had to wake up an hour early every morning  earlier than everybody else  to get just to get dressed  and he worked at a water filtration plant  a blue collar job  and michelle's mom stayed at home until they were a little older  and then she went to work as a secretary  and they never had a lot  and yet because of the love and the values that were in that household  michelle and her brother were able to get an unbelievable education and go as far as their dreams would take them  and i'd hear these same kinds of stories everywhere i went  and it reminded me that what makes america so exceptional  what makes us so special  is this basic bargain  this basic idea that in this country  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your last name is  no matter what setbacks you may experience  in this country  if you work hard  if you are willing to take responsibility  then you can make it  you can get ahead  that for the overwhelming majority of americans  that effort means that you can find a job that supports a family  and it means that you can maybe get a home that you call your own and you can send your kids to a good school and not go bankrupt when you get sick  take a vacation once in a while  nothing fancy  the i was telling some folks up in ohio about my favorite vacation when i was a kid was when i was   driving around the country and traveling around the country with my mom and my sister and my grandma  and most of the time we took greyhound buses and stayed at howard johnson's  and if there was any kind of little swimming pool anywhere  i was happy   i laughter i  and a big event was going to the vending machine and buying a soda and then filling the ice bucket and carrying it back   i laughter i  that was a big deal  but the point was you didn't do it it wasn't a luxury  it was just the chance to have a little adventure with your family  and then part of that bargain was that you could retire with dignity and respect at the end of a life and that you knew that your kids could achieve more than you did  that their lives would offer opportunities you couldn't even imagine  and that bargain  that idea of who we are as a people  that's what built this country  that's what made us into an economic superpower  this idea that anybody could make it  and being middle class didn't have anything to do necessarily with just the money in your bank account  but it had to do with a set of values and a set of beliefs about what was important  and it's those values that propelled me to get into politics in the first place  because i saw the blessings in my life and i wanted to make sure everybody in this country had those same blessings  and when we came together in  democrats  but also some republicans and independents it was because we shared that belief  that bargain  and we had a sense that it was slipping away from us  we had gone through a decade where hard work didn't always translate into higher wages or higher incomes and folks acting responsibly didn't always get ahead  and that was before the worst financial crisis and the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  which left millions more unemployed  and it looked like they were going to lose their homes  and struggling that much more to keep up with the rising cost of health care or a college education  but for the last   years  i have not forgotten why i got into politics  and i have not forgotten those values  and i haven't forgotten why we came together  because we wanted to put this country back on a track where everybody had a fair shot and everybody did their fair share and everybody played by the same set of rules  and what has kept me going  for all the progress we've made  million new jobs and half a million new manufacturing jobs and us stabilizing the financial system and averting a great depression and investing in advanced manufacturing for all the progress that we've made  what has get kept me going every single day is remembering that thing that ties us together  that binds us as a people  and understanding that no matter what we went through  no matter how many times we get knocked down  that basic character of america does not change  who we are does not change  what we believe  the values we hold dear  the importance we place on hard work and that work being rewarded  whether you are starting a small business or punching a clock  that idea that you can make it if you try here in america  that's what we've been fighting for  yes  we've been trying to put people back to work  but our goal has not been to just get us back to where we were in   our goal has been to rebuild an economy that lasts for everybody  for all people  and i am absolutely convinced that we are on that path  and we are not going backwards  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  now  i have to tell you  there are some who say  well  this is part of america's fate as it enters into the  st century  that other countries are rising and we're declining  and i just don't buy that   i audience members i  no   i the president i  what's holding us back is not it's not the lack of new ideas or big ideas or policy prescriptions that could make a difference in education or housing or health care or you name it  what's been holding us back is a stalemate in washington  and this is not just about two candidates or two political parties  this is about two fundamentally different visions for where we take our country  my opponent and his allies in congress  they've got a particular view about how you grow the economy  top down economics   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  their basic view is that if you take the bush tax cuts and on top of that you then layer on   trillion more of tax cuts  mostly for the wealthy  and you eliminate regulations on polluters or the regulations we put in place to prevent another meltdown on wall street or regulations to make sure that folks aren't being taken advantage of by unscrupulous lenders  that if you just eliminate government intrusion into the market and let folks at the very top maximize their profits  that we'll all do better  we'll all be better off   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  i mean  that's their theory  and you know  it is a theory  it's it i laughter i and you know  it would be okay for them to make that argument if we hadn't just spent close to a decade trying their theory  which resulted in the most sluggish job growth in decades  income and wages for ordinary folks going down  rising inequality  surpluses turned into deficits  culminating in the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes  now  i don't know about how you guys operate in your lives  but my general rule is if i do something and it just really doesn't work out i laughter i then i try to do something different the next time  so i've got a different idea   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  but let me tell you how i think about it  see  i don't believe in top down economics  i believe in middle out economics  i believe in bottom up economics  i believe that when you give everybody a shot and everybody is able to work hard and look after their families  everybody does better  including  by the way  folks at the top  small businesses and large businesses  suddenly they've got customers because those customers got some money in their pockets  the history of how we built this country was everybody having a chance to pursue their dreams and  together  us building opportunity that made us the envy of the world  and so i don't believe that we should try once again something that didn't work  i think what we need to do is keep pursuing a strategy that says  let's make the investments in the american people that will help us grow  but will also create ladders of opportunity for everybody  so let me be specific  when my opponent wanted to  let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  boo   i the president i i said  first of all  it's going to cost us a million jobs  second of all  i believe in the american worker  and i believe in american ingenuity  and so we got management and workers together  and guess what    years later gm is the number one automaker again  the auto industry is roaring back  and they're building better cars and more fuel efficient cars than ever  that's an example of what america can do when we work together  but it's not just the auto industry  whether we're talking about advanced manufacturing of batteries that will help us run electric cars  or wind turbines  or solar panels  or i believe in making things here in america  and i believe in inventing things here in america  and governor romney  his main calling card for running for office is his business experience  and so understandably  the american people have been asking  well  let's find out what you've been doing   i laughter i  and if your main experience is investing in companies that are called  pioneers  of outsourcing  then that indicates that we've got a different vision  because i don't want to be a pioneer of outsourcing  i want to be a pioneer of insourcing  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in austin  investing right here in the united states of america  betting on american workers  making american products that we sell  stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's why i'm running for president of the united states again   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  i'm in   i said i'd end the war in iraq  thanks to the brave men and women in uniform that serve us with such valor  i was able to keep that promise  i said we'd go after bin laden  thanks to our men and women in uniform  i kept that promise  we are now winding down the war in afghanistan and starting to bring our troops home  and so  after a decade of war  what i've said is let's take some of the savings  use half of it to help pay down our deficit  let's use the other half to do some nation building here at home  let's rebuild our roads and our bridges  let's build broadband lines into rural communities  let's build high speed rail that helps move people and services all across this country  let's invest in basic research and innovation that has made places like austin a hotbed of entrepreneurship and invention  we've got tens of thousands of folks who lost their jobs in the construction industry after the housing bubble went burst  let's put them to work rebuilding america  that's what we do best  and by making those investments  we're not just putting people back to work right now  we're laying the foundation for economic growth for decades to come  that's my vision for america  now  mr  romney disagrees  he said ending the war in iraq as i did was  tragic   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  he said he wouldn't set a timeline in afghanistan   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i've got a different approach  and ultimately  you're the ones who are going to be able to settle this dispute with your vote  that's what our democracy is all about  i'm running again because we've done some great work reforming our education system  but we got more work to do  i want to hire outstanding new teachers  especially in math and science  we succeeded in preventing student loan rates from doubling  but we've got more work to do to bring down college tuition costs to make it affordable for every young person  i want to expand access to community colleges for   million more americans so they get trained for the jobs that people are hiring for right now  a higher education is no longer a luxury  it is an economic imperative in the  st century  it is part of what we need to succeed in this global economy  and i'm going to fight for every young person who is willing to work hard to get an education  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  so on issue after issue  there is a fundamental difference  on housing  mr  romney says let's just let foreclosures happen  and the market will bottom out  i want to make sure that every american who right now owns a home can refinance their homes at historically low rates put   in the pocket of every american  not only will you spend that and create more customers for businesses  but it can also help stabilize the housing market  when it comes to immigration  mr  romney thinks that the arizona law should be  a model for the nation   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i believe we're a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants  we've worked hard on border security  but i've also said that when you've got young people in this country who have been raised as americans  who believe in america  then i want to give them a chance to succeed here in america  it's the right thing to do  i don't want to go back to the days when fighting for the country you love depended on who you love  we ended  don't ask  don't tell  we're not going to go back there  we're not going to roll back wall street reform  we know the costs when you've got lax regulation  everybody is affected  everybody pays a price  and we are not rolling back health care reform  the supreme court has spoken  we are moving forward  if you've got health care  the only thing that now happens to you you're not paying a tax the only thing that's happening to you is that you have more security because insurance companies can't jerk you around  young people can stay on their parent's plan until they're   years old  seniors are going to see lower prescription drug prices  everybody is going to get free preventive care  including women  and by the way  insurance companies can't charge women more than men now  which reminds me  we're not ending funding for planned parenthood  i think women should have control of their own health care choices just like men  we're not going backwards  if you don't have health care  then we're going to help you get it  and the only people who may have a problem with this law are folks who can afford health care  but aren't buying it  wait until they get sick  and then going to the emergency room and expecting everybody else to pick up the tab  that's not responsibility  that's not consistent with who we are  so we're going to move forward on health care  and which brings me to one last issue  this whole issue of deficits and debt  now  the other side says  this is the most important issue  we're concerned for future generations  now  if you are truly concerned about deficits and debt  it's puzzling that you would then propose a   trillion tax cut that would give the average millionaire a   tax break  and to pay for it you would then have to gut education  gut investments in science and research  gut our transportation spending  voucherize medicare oh  and in the process  eventually  you're probably going to have to raise taxes on middle class families   i audience members i  no   i the president i  now  we've already cut a trillion dollars  and i don't believe every government program works  i don't believe that government can help folks who don't want to help themselves  so we've got to continue to make government more efficient and more effective and more customer friendly  but we're not going to turn back the clock to the days when seniors had to fend for themselves  where poor children are on their own  where we're not making investments in education and falling further and further behind other countries   i audience members i  no   i the president i  so what i've said is let's ask folks like me  who have been incredibly blessed by this country  to do a little bit more   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  what i've said is i told congress last week  let's go ahead and say everybody who's making   a year or less  your income taxes will not go up one dime  period  that includes   percent of americans    percent of small businesses  but for folks like me  we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we are investing in america's future  and by the way  we tried that too  austin  a guy named bill clinton tried it  and we took deficits and turned them into surpluses  created   million new jobs  and by the way  wealthy people did really well also  because  again  if folks in the middle class are doing well  everybody does well  it's that basic principle  abraham lincoln said that there are some things we do better together  we are entrepreneurs  we are risk takers  we're rugged individualists  but there are some things we do better together  that's how we financed the gi bill that created the largest middle class in history  that's how we built the hoover dam and the golden gate bridge  that's how we sent a man to the moon  that's how the internet came to happen  because we recognized there are some things we do well together and we rise or fall as one nation  as one people  and so here's the good news  is that in this election  you will have an opportunity to choose between these two visions  and that's the way democracy should work  now  i will say that there's going to be about well  we who knows how much money is going to be spent  we've got folks writing   million checks   i audience members i  boo   i the president i running negative ads with scary voices   i laughter i  and it's basically the same message every time  you know  they've got variations on a theme  but basically  these folks know they can't sell those tired economic theories that didn't work last time  so what they're going to do is just to say  the economy is not where it needs to be  and it's obama's fault  i mean  that's what they'll say over and over again  and they'll just keep repeating it  and they hope it works  now  this is a plan to win an election  but it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to grow the middle class   i audience members i  no   i the president i  and i got to say  i'd be pretty concerned about it except for what you taught me  what you taught me in '  what i learned in those early campaigns traveling around the state and going to vfw halls and diners and sitting in people's living rooms  listening to their stories  what you taught me was that when the american people focus and recognize the stakes  and when they think back to the values that propelled their parents and their grandparents and their great grandparents forward in the face of very difficult times those folks  those generations who came here  some as immigrants  some not of their own accord  working in farms or ranches or factories or mills or mines when the american people tap into what is true and good  that grit and determination and just neighborliness that built this country  you guys can't be stopped  it doesn't matter how much money the other side spends  you can't be stopped  and so the question's going to be  how bad do we want it  how bad are we willing to work for it  the how committed are we to making sure that our kids get a great education  how committed are we to make sure that social security and medicare are there for folks in the future  how committed are we to make sure that our veterans  who have served us valiantly  that we're serving them as well as they've served us  how committed are we to bringing down our deficit in a balanced way  how committed are we to continuing to invest in science and research  how committed are we to that basic american bargain that says if you work hard  you can get ahead  in   i tried to just make promises that i could keep  and one of those promises  i said to you  i'm not a perfect man and i i laughter i i promise  talk to michelle now i laughter i not a perfect man  i said i wouldn't be a perfect president  but what i said was that i would always tell you where i stood  i'd always tell you what i thought  and i would spend every single waking hour  as long as i had the privilege of being your president  fighting for you  thinking about you  because in you  i saw me  in you  i saw my family  if i in your grandparents  i saw my grandparents  in your kids  i see my kids  because of you  because of my faith in you  through all the ups and downs  i can say i have kept that promise  and if you still believe in me  if you're willing to stand up with me  if you're willing to knock on doors for me and make phone calls for me and talk to your friends and neighbors for me and mobilize and organize  then we will finish what we started in   and we will build this middle class and grow this economy so it works for everybody  and we will remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  san anton  hello  texas  well  thank you so much  everybody have a seat  have a seat  it is good to be with all of you  good to be back in san antonio  couple of people i want to acknowledge who helped to make this day possible  first of all  your outstanding mayor  julian castro  somebody whose name i know you're familiar with because we are in the henry gonzalez convention center  a great friend  outstanding leader  great congressman  charlie gonzalez is in the house  another fighter for working people  lloyd doggett is here  one of my national cochairs and just a great friend and a great advocate and a really good actress too eva longoria  and finally  our futuro fund cochair and a wonderful friend and supporter  henry munoz  now  this is my last campaign  it's true  i'm term limited out   i laughter i  and that got me thinking about some of my first campaigns  i know that charlie and julian and others  they think back to your first campaigns  and back then  i didn't have air force one   i laughter i  didn't have a motorcade  no helicopter  i did the driving myself  and we didn't even have mapquest i laughter i i'd have to unfold the maps  and illinois  like texas  is a big state  so i'd have to travel all across the state  and you'd go from urban neighborhoods to rural communities  suburbs  you'd meet folks from every walk of life  black  white  latino  asian  native american  and wherever i traveled  what i discovered was that there was a common theme to everyone's story  if i met an elderly couple  i'd think back to my grandparents and how my grandfather fought in patton's army in world war ii and my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line  and when my grandfather came back home  he was able to attend college on the gi bill  and they were able to buy their first home with an fha loan  and i'd think about the distance they'd traveled from the small towns in kansas where they had been born  and if i met a single mom i'd think about my mother  who had to raise me and my sister basically by herself  with some help from my grandparents  because my father had left  so that i didn't even know him  and how she had to work and go to school and look after her kids  but with the help of grants and scholarships  she was able to get an outstanding education and  more importantly from her perspective  give me and my sister a great education  and i thought about how much that would be possible in some other place  and if i met a working family  i'd think about michelle's family  her dad had multiple sclerosis  so by the time i met him  he could barely walk  had to use two canes  and had to wake up an hour earlier than everybody else to get dressed before going to work  he worked at a water filtration plant  blue collar worker  and michelle's mom stayed at home when the kids were young  and then worked as a secretary  but michelle's dad  despite his disability  never missed a day of work and went to every dance recital and every basketball game and had just a great joy about him  and so all across the state of illinois  i would be traveling and i'd meet people  and i'd say  you know what  their story is my story  and then when i began to run for president  i traveled all across the country  including here in texas  i'd realize  well  the stories i've been hearing in illinois  those are america's story  and at the heart of that story was a basic idea  which is  in this country  unlike any other  the basic bargain that binds us together is the idea that if we work hard  if we're responsible  then you can get ahead  that you're endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights  life  liberty  but also the pursuit of happiness not a guarantee  but the chance to get ahead if you work hard  and so generation after generation  parents  grandparents  great grandparents toiling against all odds  understanding that at some point this hard work would pay off and they could climb their way into a middle class  and that middle class didn't just have to do with how much money you had in your bank account  it had to do with the idea that you could always find a job that supported a family and you wouldn't go bankrupt when you got sick and you could buy a home to call your own and you could make sure your kids had a good education  maybe you take a vacation once in a while  nothing fancy  but time to spend with those you love  and you could retire with dignity and respect  and most of all  you could expect that your children could aspire to things that you never even imagined  that was the heart that is the heart of the american idea  this basic idea that no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your last name is  here in america  you can make it if you try  and in   when i ran for president and so many of you supported me  we ran because we believed in that idea and we believed that that basic bargain had been fraying  we had seen a decade in which hard work wasn't paying off for too many people  so people were working harder than ever  but the cost of living  gas  college  health care  all were going up  incomes  wages flatlining  we'd gone from surplus to record deficits  job growth stagnant  and so what compelled us together to make this effort was specific issues  but it was also  how do we get that idea back for the vast majority of americans  and what we didn't know at the time was  is that we were looking at the worst financial crisis in a generation  the worst economic crisis since the great depression  and so millions of people were losing their jobs even as i was wrapping up the campaign  and people lost their homes  and more and more folks struggled  and it felt as if that dream was slipping even further away  but we have not been deterred  as much work as we still have to do  over the last   years that focus on how do we build a middle class that is strong and secure and growing  that has remained my central focus  and as i applause i and even as we've created   million new jobs and   jobs in manufacturing and stabilized the financial system all the steps we've taken  without much cooperation from the other side that's still been our north star  and what's always helped me every single day move forward is the recognition and the belief and the understanding that although the times have been tough  the american people have been tougher  and that for everything that happened during that financial crisis and the recession that followed  america's fundamental character did not change  people's willingness to work hard did not change  people's ability to bounce back from adversity had not changed  and now  as we look out at the future  the question is  how do we best fulfill that goal  that aim that we set for ourselves in   for all the progress we've made  we did not embark on this journey just to get back to where we were in   we worked hard because we want a country where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody's doing their fair share and everybody's playing by the same set of rules  that's why i ran for president in   that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  as we think about this election  understand that the challenges we face are solvable  sometimes it's fashionable among the pundits to say  well  america is in decline  or our best days are behind us  you hear that periodically  this isn't the first time we've heard that about america  and i could not disagree more  because there's not a problem out there that we can't solve  the problem is not that we don't have technical solutions or big ideas to tackle these challenges  the problem is we've got a stalemate in washington right now  and it's more than just a difference between two candidates  more than just a difference between two political parties  it is two fundamentally different visions about how to move america forward  my opponent and his allies in congress  they believe that prosperity comes from the top down  they believe that if we keep in place the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans and then we add on top of that another   trillion of tax cuts most of which would go to people who don't need tax cuts and frankly aren't even asking for them if we do all that  even if it means gutting education investments  even if it means slashing transportation  even if it means that we're not able to take care of our veterans as effectively  even if it means that we're not investing in basic science and research  even if it means that medicare we've got to voucherize even if we do all those things  they still believe that those tax cuts that benefit folks at the top will result in everybody being better off  that's their basic economic theory  it's not complicated  they've got one other element to it  in fairness  they also say they want to eliminate regulations on insurance companies and wall street banks regulations we put in place to protect consumers from unscrupulous mortgage practices and that take regulations off of polluters  if we do those things along with the tax cuts  the market will be freed up  government's out of the way  and happy days are here again  that's their theory   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and don't take my word for it  go to their web sites  look at the budget that was passed by the house republicans  that's their theory  that's what it boils down to  now  it is a theory i laughter i and some of you might be persuaded by this theory if it hadn't been for the fact that we just tried it   i laughter i  we spent almost a decade doing what they prescribed  and how did it turn out  we didn't see greater job growth  we didn't see middle class security  we saw the opposite  and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis in our lifetimes  precisely because there were no regulations that were adequate to the kinds of recklessness that was being carried out  so i don't know about you  i don't know how you guys operate in your life  but my general rule is if i do something and it doesn't work i laughter i i don't go back to doing it  we don't go backwards  we go forwards  so i've got a different idea  i don't believe in top down economics  i believe in middle out economics  i believe in bottom up economics  i believe in fighting on behalf of working families and giving them opportunity and putting some money in their pockets  because when we do that  everybody does better  folks at the bottom  folks in the middle  and folks at the top  that's not a democratic idea  that's an american idea  that's what built this country  that's what made us into an economic superpower  so let's just be more specific about some contrasts here  my opponent thought it was a good idea to  let detroit go bankrupt  with a million jobs at stake  i disagreed  i wanted to make a bet on america's workers and american industry and american manufacturing  and   years later  the auto industry is back  gm is number one  ford and chrysler are selling cars  that's my vision for america  and this is not unique to the auto industry  i want advanced manufacturing locating here in san antonio  i want us to be making things here in the united states of america  so i want to end tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in texas  right here in the united states of america  let's put american workers back to work selling goods stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's my vision for america  my opponent has a different idea  his main calling card for wanting to be president is his private sector experience  so we asked the voters to examine that experience  he invested made money investing in companies that have been called  pioneers  in outsourcing  i don't want pioneers of outsourcing in the white house  i want somebody who believes in insourcing  let's bring those jobs back home  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  in   i made a promise we'd end the war in iraq  we ended it  i promised to go after bin laden  we got him  we're transitioning out of afghanistan and starting to bring our troops home  and what i've said is  as we wind down these wars  let's take half the money that we spent on war to pay down the deficit  let's use the other half to do some nation building here at home  now  mr  romney disagrees with me on this  said it was  tragic  the way i ended the war in iraq  doesn't want to set a timetable for ending the war in afghanistan  but you know  i'm looking around this country and i know from our history  from world history  that no nation has always been stronger than its economy  that's an issue of our national defense  and so because of our outstanding men and women in uniform  we know that we've got the greatest military on earth  but we also have to have the best economy on earth to support those troops  and that means  let's start investing  rebuilding roads and rebuilding bridges and laying broadband lines into rural communities  let's rebuild schools that are overcrowded and give them state of the art science labs  and let's rebuild our ports and our runways  that's what america is about  is rebuilding  and we've got thousands of construction workers out there that are ready to get to work  let's put them to work  that will be good for our economy and  over the long term  will be good for our strength  that's a difference between myself and my opponent  as long as i'm commander in chief  we're going to make sure that our veterans are properly cared for  and we have expanded our funding and improved how we are working with our veterans  but we've got more work to do  and that requires resources  we're sure not going to spend that money better on tax cuts for me   i laughter i  i want to make sure that a young man or woman who has served our country  who has fought for us  they shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  i'm running to make sure that america has the best education system on earth  from pre k all the way to postgraduate  and that means hiring new teachers  especially in math and science  and it means building on the work we've already done to make sure that student loan rates don't double  to make sure that middle class families are getting tuition tax credits  now we've got to reduce the cost of college  make it more affordable to everybody  i want to expand opportunities for   million young people to go to community colleges so they can get trained on the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  because today education is not a luxury  today a higher education is an economic imperative for the  st century  and i want to make sure that the united states of america once again has the highest percentage of college graduates because that is going to help determine who wins the race in this global economy in the  st century  and i want america to be number one  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  on almost every issue  there's a stark contrast between my vision and my opponent's  when it comes to housing  he wants to just let foreclosures bottom out  i don't think that's a solution  that's part of the problem  so i want to actually help families all across texas and all across the country refinance  at these historically low rates  the average family could save   a year  in your pockets  that will not just be good for you  that will not just be good for the housing market  that will be good for the economy  but we need to get it done  i don't want to go back to the days when whether you could serve your country or not depended on who you loved  we ended  don't ask  don't tell  and i want to make sure that it stays ended because it was a bad idea  i don't want to go back to the day when women didn't have control of their health care choices  i've got two daughters  and i want them to have the same control over their health care as anybody's sons out there  i believe that's the right thing to do  and we don't need another   years of arguments about health care   i audience members i  no   i the president i  the affordable health care act  otherwise known as obamacare  was the right thing to do  and you know what  they're right  i do care  i care about folks who get sick and go bankrupt  i care about parents who don't know whether or not they're going to be able to get treatment for their kids  it was the right thing to do  and for all the misinformation out there  it's very simple to describe what's going to happen  if you already have health care  the only thing that you have to do is enjoy the fact that now insurance companies can't jerk you around because of the small print  you have rights  your kids can stay on your parent's their parent's plan until they're   years old  senior citizens are seeing reductions in prescription drug costs  if you don't have health insurance  we're going to help you get it  and yes  it's true we expect everybody to act responsibly  so for the   percent or   percent of people who still don't get health insurance even though they can afford it  we're going to say to them  you can't pass off those costs on to somebody else in the form of higher premiums  you've got to take responsibility as well  it was the right thing to do  we are not going backwards  we're going forwards  and   million people are going to get health insurance because of it  we're not going backwards when it comes to immigration  my opponent says the arizona law could be  a model for the nation   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i believe we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants  i believe we can secure our borders and give opportunities to people who are striving and working hard  especially young people who have been raised in this country and see themselves as americans  that was the right thing to do  we're not going backwards  we're going forwards  and we're going to get control of our deficit and debt  but not with the plan that these folks are promoting  i mean  they say this is the most important issue  the thing they care about most  and then they propose a   trillion tax cut that would mostly benefit folks who don't need it and would blow a hole a mile wide through our budget  now  i don't believe government can solve every problem  not every government program works  we've already cut a trillion dollars out of our federal budget  and we can do more  but we've got to do it smartly and responsibly  i don't believe that government can help somebody that doesn't want to help themselves  but for all those folks who are working hard every day  i want to make sure that we continue to invest so that young people can go to college  that we continue to take steps so that we've got a great transportation system to move people and goods and services across the country  i want to make sure that we're investing in basic research and science that has given us this technological lead that allowed us to grow and become the economic superpower that we are  so what i've said is  yes  we'll make some more cuts  but let's ask folks who have been incredibly blessed to do a little bit more  to go back to the rates we had under bill clinton  and you know what  that theory has been tested as well  because when bill clinton did it  we had surpluses instead of deficits  we created   million new jobs  and people at the top did really well also  like i said  that's been our history  when middle class folks are doing well and those striving to get into the middle class are doing well  everybody does well  and that maybe is what is at the heart of the difference in this debate  see  i believe in individual initiative and entrepreneurship and risk taking  and i believe that the free market is the greatest system on earth to create wealth and prosperity  but just like abraham lincoln said  there are some things we do better together than we do on our own  when my grandfather came back home and that generation got the gi bill that was great for everyone because it upgraded the skills of all of our workers  that wasn't just good for some  that was good for all  when we invested in the hoover dam or the golden gate bridge or the transcontinental rail system  or when we sent a man to the moon or invented the internet  that was good for everybody  there are some things we do better together  and we rise or fall as one nation  that's what i believe  that's what our history tells us  that's what our future demands  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  so let me just say this  in the next   months  you guys won't see them because you're not considered one of the battleground states  although that's going to be changing soon  but there's going to be more money spent than we've ever seen before  folks writing   million checks to try to beat me  running ads with scary voices i laughter i and basically  one message  i mean  it's a very simple message  their message is the economy is not where it needs to be and it's obama's fault  so there will be various there will be variations on the theme  but it will be the same message over and over and over again  that's what they're banking on  because they can't sell their actual economic plan  so their goal is to see if they can knock us down  more money than we've ever seen before  and it's understandable that some folks get cynical about the political process as a result  but what you taught me in   it's the same thing that i learned in my first campaigns  as i was traveling around in my car  going from town to town  talking to people in their living rooms or vfw halls or diners  and trying to get their votes and hearing stories about people's parents and grandparents and great grandparents  some who came as immigrants  some who were brought here not of their own accord  some who worked in mills or mines  some who worked on farms  ranches  the thing i learned was that there is a core decency and grit and faith in the american people  and when the american people decide what's true and what's right and they join together to bring about change  to make this country more responsive to the hopes and dreams of ordinary people  when that happens  it doesn't matter how much money the other side spends  it can't be stopped   i applause i  it cannot be stopped  you showed that in   and i believe you're going to show it again in   i tried to make promises in   that i knew i could keep  and one of those promises was that i wasn't a perfect man and i wouldn't be a perfect president  but i'd always tell you what i thought and i'd always tell you where i stood  and i'd spend every waking minute fighting as hard as i knew how for you  making sure that every single day i was thinking about how to make your lives a little bit better  and i knew i could keep that promise because i saw myself in you  and when i saw your grandparents  i saw my grandparents  and when i saw your kids  i saw my kids  and i've kept that promise  and i still believe in you  and if you still believe in me and you're willing to stand up and knock on doors and make phone calls and get out there and fight on behalf of a vision in which every american has opportunity to pursue their dreams  i promise you  we will finish what we started in   we will not be going backwards  we will be going forwards  we will win this election  and we will remind the world just why it is that the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the great state of texas  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  florida  oh  it is good to be back in jacksonville  florida  a couple people i just want to say thank you to  first of all  please give don herrin a big round of applause for the introduction  one of our outstanding members of congress  your own corrine brown is here  another great member of the florida delegation  ted deutch is here  and congresswoman and chair of the democratic national committee  debbie wasserman schultz is in the house  and all of you are here  and i'm happy about that  i'm sorry we were a little delayed had some weather issues  even air force one has to fly around the thunder   i laughter i  but we are so glad to be back  and i want to thank all of you for being here   i audience member i  i love you   i the president i  i love you back  that's why i came  now  jacksonville  this is my last political campaign   i audience members i  no   i the president i  it's true  i'm term limited   i laughter i  and since it's my last campaign  it got me thinking about my first political campaigns  early on  back when i had no gray hair   i laughter i  and when i was running for the state senate or i was running for the united states senate in illinois  illinois is a big state like florida  and we'd have to travel across the state  and i didn't have air force one back then   i laughter i  no marine one  so i didn't even have gps   i laughter i  so i'd be driving  maybe i'd have one staff person in the car  and since we didn't have mapquest  i had to have a map  and i'd fold it  and then  i'd try to unfold it and fold it back the way it was  and i'd get it all messed up  and i'd get lost  and then  once i got to an event  i'd have to find parking  and sometimes  i couldn't find a parking spot  or i'd get rained on  but i have such fond memories of those early campaigns because  no matter where i went  no matter what community inner city  rural town  meeting with black folks  white folks  latinos  asians  native americans didn't matter what background people came from  no matter how much they looked different on the surface  there was a common thread to all the stories that i heard as i traveled around the state  i'd meet an elderly couple  and they'd remind me of my grandparents  i'd think about my grandfather who fought in patton's army in world war ii  my grandmother working on a bomber assembly line while he was gone  and when he came back  he was rewarded with a chance to go to college on the gi bill  they were able to buy their first home with an fha loan  and i'd think about the journey that they had traveled and everything that that greatest generation had done to build america  or i'd meet a middle class couple  and i'd think about michelle's parents  especially her dad  who had multiple sclerosis  so by the time i met him  he could barely walk  had to use two canes  had to wake up an hour earlier than everybody else to get to work because that's how long it took to get him dressed  but would not miss a day of work  and i'd think about michelle's mom  who ended up working as a secretary for most of her life and how  despite the fact that they never had a lot  they were able to give michelle and michelle's brother the best education possible  and how remarkable that was  this country that we live in  and then i'd meet a single mom and i'd think about my own mother  who raised my sister and me  with the help of my grandparents  because my dad left when i was a baby  and my mom didn't have a lot of money  but she worked hard and she went to school at the same time so that she could give her two children the best education possible and they could travel on a path that she couldn't have even imagined  so the people i met in that first campaign and every campaign since  they had all kinds of different stories  all kinds of different backgrounds  they were young and old and every race and every faith gay  straight  democrat  republican  independent but all of them shared the belief in that core american experience  that basic idea  that core bargain that makes us the shining example for the world  the idea that no matter where you come from  no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  america is a place where you can make it if you try  as americans  we don't expect handouts  but we expect hard work to pay off  we understand there will be setbacks  but we also know that responsibility should be rewarded  we believe that if you put enough effort into it  enough elbow grease into it  you should be able to find a job that pays the bills  you should be able to have a home that you call your own  health care that you can count on if you get sick  you should be able to retire with dignity and respect  you should be able to provide your children with an education that gives them an even better shot than you had  that's what we believe  jacksonville  we are here today because we recognize that this basic bargain  this essence of who we are as a people  this simple american dream is at risk like never before  for more than a decade  it had been slipping away from too many hard working people  jobs and factories were shipped overseas  folks at the top were doing better than ever before  but middle class families saw their paychecks get smaller even as their bills got bigger  in washington  the trillions that were spent on two wars and two tax cuts took us from record surpluses to record deficits  and on wall street  a culture of anything goes led to the worst economic crisis and financial crisis since the great depression  now  ever since i first ran for this office  i've said it's going to take more than   year or one term or maybe even one president to restore the dream that built this country  and the financial crisis and economic crisis made our job that much harder  but i don't get discouraged  because the cynics who say that our best days are behind us  they haven't witnessed the everyday courage and the essential character of the american people  they haven't met the small business owners in minnesota who chose to sacrifice some of their own perks  some of their own pay  to avoid laying off a single worker during that recession  they haven't been to the auto companies in michigan and ohio that were never supposed to build another car again  but now they can't build them fast enough  they haven't talked to the  year old factory worker from north carolina who decided that when the furniture industry left town she'd get her degree in biotechnology from the local community college  not just because she hopes it gets her a job  but because she hopes it tells her children  you don't give up on your dreams  that's the character i've seen in the american people  that's who we are  there are no easy fixes  no quick solutions to the challenges we face  but there is no doubt in my mind that we have the capacity to meet them and we will meet them  we've got the best workers in the world and the best entrepreneurs in the world and the best scientists in the world and the best researchers and the best colleges and the best universities  we're a young nation with the greatest diversity and talent and ingenuity from every corner of the globe  and florida knows something about that  no matter what the naysayers tell us  there is not a country on earth that would not happily trade places with the united states of america  so the problem what's standing in our way is not technical solutions to the problems of housing or education or dealing with the debt  we know how to deal with it  what's standing in our way is our politics   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  it's what's going on in washington  it's the notion that compromise is a bad word  the notion that the only path forward is going backwards to the same top down economics that got us into this mess in the first place   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  our opponent's entire plan the same plan of his allies in congress is to cut more taxes for the wealthy  cut more regulations for banks and insurance companies  cut more investments in things like education and research   i audience members i  boo   i the president i all with the hope that somehow that will create jobs and prosperity everywhere  that's what mitt romney believes  that's what folks in his party in washington believe  but you know what  florida  that's not what you and i believe   i audience members i  no   i the president i  that's not what most americans believe  no matter what party you belong to  because this country was not built on top down economics  this country was built from the middle class out  it was built from the bottom up  that's how we became the most prosperous nation in the history of the world  that's the path you can choose for america in this election  and that is why i am running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  i am running because  like you  i believe you cannot reduce the deficit and deal with our debt without asking folks like me  without asking the wealthiest americans  to give up the taxes they've been getting for the last decade  now  my opponent doesn't just want to keep these tax cuts  he wants to cut those taxes by another   trillion  including a  percent tax cut for every millionaire in the country   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  hold on  it gets better   i laughter i  to pay for this  he plans to gut things like job training and financial aid for college and potentially raise taxes on the middle class  on you   i audience members i  no   i the president i  he plans to roll back health care reform  forcing more than   floridians to pay more for their prescription drugs  he plans to turn medicare into a voucher program   i audience members i  no   i the president i  so if that voucher isn't worth enough to buy the health insurance that's on the market  you're out of luck  you're on your own  one independent nonpartisan study found that seniors would have to pay nearly   more for medicare than they do today   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  florida  that's the wrong way to go  it's wrong to ask seniors to pay more for medicare just so millionaires and billionaires can pay less in taxes  that's not the way to reduce the deficit  we shouldn't be squeezing more money out of seniors who are just barely getting by right now  my plan is to squeeze more money out of the health care system by eliminating waste and going after abuse and fraud in medicare  we can cut back government spending that we can't afford  but i will also ask anybody who is making over   a year to just go back to the rates they were paying under bill clinton  because  by the way  that worked  nearly   million new jobs were created  the largest budget surplus in our history  and when we were doing it that way  where the burden was shared  actually  millionaires did really well  that's the choice we have in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term as president   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  there is such a contrast in approach  two fundamentally different visions that you're going to have to choose from in this election  when the american auto industry was on the brink of collapse  more than   million jobs on the line  governor romney said let's  let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i refused to turn my back on a great industry and on american workers  i bet on american workers  i bet on american manufacturing  and   years later  the american auto industry has come roaring back  so i want to make sure that the high tech manufacturing jobs of tomorrow not just in the auto industry  but in every industry that those advanced manufacturing jobs are taking root not in china  not in germany  but in jacksonville and in cleveland and in raleigh and in richmond  governor romney's experience has been owning companies that were called  pioneers  in the business of outsourcing  wants to give tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  i want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the united states  rewarding companies that are investing here and hiring american workers  so we can sell products around the world stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's why i'm running  i'm running because in   i promised to end the war in iraq  and thanks to our outstanding men and women in uniform  we kept that promise  it's time to do some nation building here at home  america is safer and more respected because of the selflessness of our troops  so not only did we end the war in iraq  we've been able to go after al qaida and get bin laden  we have set a timeline to end the war in afghanistan  and as long as i'm commander in chief  this country will care for our veterans and serve our veterans as well as they've served us  nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  so my plan would take about half the money that we're no longer spending on war and use that to pay down the deficit  use the other half to put people back to work rebuilding our roads  our bridges  our runways  our ports  wireless networks  i want to create a veterans job corps  so we can put our returning heroes back to work as cops and firefighters in communities that need them  that's the america we want to build  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  i'm running to make sure that america once again leads the world in educating our kids and training our workers  i want to help our schools hire and reward the best teachers  especially in math and science  let's give   million more americans the chance to go to community colleges and learn the skills that local businesses are looking for right now  let's work with colleges and universities to bring down the cost of tuition once and for all  in the  st century  higher education isn't a luxury  it's a necessity that every american should be able to afford  on every measure  there's a difference in this election  my opponent has a plan to help responsible homeowners by letting the housing market hit bottom   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  that isn't a solution  that's a problem  we've already helped more than a million responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages  and now i want to give everybody the chance to refinance and save   a year  that's a plan for housing  that's the choice in this election  i'm running because i believe nobody in america should go broke just because they get sick  and because we passed the health care law  we are going to realize that goal  the supreme court has spoken  we are moving forward  we are going to help people who are working hard to make sure that just because they have an illness in their family  they don't lose everything  and by the way  if you've already got health insurance  this just gives you the guarantee and security when you're dealing with your insurance company that they won't jerk you around because of the fine print  and it lets your young it lets young people stay on their parent's plan until they're   years old  and it helps our seniors reduce their prescription drug costs  we're not going to roll that back  we're not going to refight that fight for the next   years  we need to move forwards  not backwards  just like we're not going to refight the issue of whether you can serve the country you love just depending on who you love  we ended  don't ask  don't tell  it was the right thing to do  we're not going back and having that fight  we need to move forward  we need to make sure that women have control over their own health care decisions  we're not going backwards  we're moving forward  all these issues connect  whether it's bringing manufacturing and construction jobs back  or protecting your health care  or making sure our kids are getting the best education  making sure our veterans are getting the care that they have earned all these things make up a middle class life  they're all central to the idea that made this country great  that promise that if you work hard  you can get ahead  it's the same promise our parents and grandparents passed down to all of us  the promise we have to pass down to our kids and our grandkids  the idea that we work hard  that everybody has got to take responsibility  that government can't solve every problem and it certainly can't solve problems if you don't want to help yourself  but we also know there are some things we do better together  that we rise or fall as one nation and as one people  over the course of the next   months  the other side will spend more money than we have ever seen in our lifetimes on ads that tell you the same thing you've been hearing for months  they know their plan isn't going to sell  so all they'll keep doing is saying  the economy is not where it should be and it's all obama's fault   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  that's basically their message  now  i guess that's a plan to win an election  but they can't hide the fact that it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to grow the economy  so they don't have a plan to revive the middle class  everything they're proposing we tried for a decade  and it didn't work  so they don't have a plan  and i do  and  florida  i've been outspent before  and i've been counted out before  but through every campaign  what has always given me hope is the american people  you have the ability to cut through all that nonsense  what gives me hope is that you remember the stories of families just like mine  all the struggles of parents and great grandparents and some folks coming here as immigrants  some brought here in chains  some working on the farm  some working in the mines or on the mills they didn't know what to expect  but they understood that there was something different about this country  they knew that this was a country where things might not be perfect  but working together  we could perfect our union  where people were free to pursue their own individual dreams  but still come together as neighbors  as friends  as one american family  they knew that being middle class wasn't about how much you had in your bank account  it was about the security of knowing you could take care of your family and give your kids the chance to pursue the life that they dream of and the chance to give something back to this country that gave you so much  and when we tap into that spirit  when we push aside all the talk and all the politics and get down to that core of what it means to be american  all that money doesn't matter  all those negative ads don't matter  when you come together  you cannot be stopped  and so you can still make change happen  florida  you can still inspire each other  because you inspire me  in   i tried to only make promises that i could keep or work on keeping  and i told you then i was not a perfect man and i wouldn't be a perfect president  but i also told you i'd always tell you what i thought  i'd always tell you where i stood  and most of all  i would wake up every single day and spend every waking hour thinking about you  fighting as hard as i knew how for you  because i see myself in you  your grandparents remind me of my grandparents  when i see your kids  i think about my kids  and so i have kept that promise  florida  i've been fighting for you  and i keep believing in you  and now i am asking for your vote  not just for me  but for the country that we believe in together  and if you still believe  and if you're willing to stand up with me and knock on doors for me and make phone calls for me  talk to your neighbors and talk to your friends  talk to your coworkers  talk to your family  we will win florida  and we will win this election  we'll finish what we started in   and we will remind the world just why it is that the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  everybody  thank you  thank you  what a great crowd  everybody  take have a seat  i want everybody to be relaxed  i am so excited to be here  now  first of all  i just want to say  that's the most kisses i've gotten at any campaign event  and that's just half of the crew  i might get some more on the way around here  i like that   i applause i  i like that  i like that  can everybody please give david israel a big round of applause for the great introduction  a couple of other people i want to acknowledge  first of all  palm beach mayor jeri muoio  give her a big round of applause  you just heard from an outstanding congresswoman and the chair of the democratic national committee  debbie wasserman schultz  we love her  and your own outstanding congressman who is doing a great job looking out for you every single day in washington  ted deutch is here  where's ted  he is back here somewhere  where did he go  there he is over there  look at him  there he is  and all of you are here  and i'm excited about that  so how is everybody doing today  you're doing good  i am excited to be in century village  this is legendary  century village  the folks are fired up in century village  now  by the way  i'm just curious how many folks who originally were from my hometown of chicago  i'll bet there are some chicagoans here   i applause i  all right  see  i knew there were some white sox fans here  i hope   i audience member i  no   i the president i  sox  don't talk about the cubs now   i laughter i  so i have to tell you this is my last political campaign   i audience members i  aww   i the president i  no  this is michelle thinks it's very good  she thinks it's great  michelle thinks it's great   i audience member i   i inaudible i   i the president i   i laughter i  i am term limited  so this is going to be my last campaign  and it got me kind of nostalgic thinking about some of my first campaigns  i ran for state senate when i was   years old  and then i ran for the united states senate  and back then  i didn't have marine one   i laughter i  i didn't have air force one  i didn't even have anybody driving me around  i was driving myself  filling up my own gas   i laughter i  and we didn't have fancy stuff like gps  so if you wanted to go somewhere  you had to get a map  so you'd be fumbling around with it  trying to figure out how to fold it back nicely   i laughter i  and a bunch of times  i'd get lost  and then  finally  when i got to the place i was supposed to be  i had to find my own parking spot  i couldn't just pull up  these days  i just pull up   i laughter i  sometimes  it would be raining  and i'd be trying to find my umbrella  by the time i got into the event  i'd be soaked  but i have such great memories of those first campaigns  and the reason is because everywhere i went and illinois is a big state  so you'd go to inner cities and farm towns and suburbs and people of every walk of life everywhere i went  i'd hear people's stories  and those stories reminded me of my own stories  so if i saw a couple that was   or   and i'd think about my grandparents who fought in world war ii my grandfather fought in world war ii and my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line  and when my grandfather came home  he was able to get a college education because of the gi bill and was able to buy their first home using the with the help of the fha  and i was reminded of that greatest generation  everything they did on behalf of building this great country that we live in   i audience member i  and we're still here   i the president i  there you go  and then if i met a single mom  i'd think about my own mom  my dad left when i was an infant and so i didn't know him  but and my mom didn't have a lot of money  but with the help of my grandparents  she was able to work and put herself through school and then give a great education to me and my sister  and i'd think about how this country is so great because people have opportunities  even if they don't come from a fancy background  and i'd meet a working couple  and i'd think about michelle's parents  michelle's dad had multiple sclerosis  ms  and by the time i met him  he could barely walk  had to use two canes and had to wake up an hour earlier than everybody else to get dressed to get to work  he worked as a blue collar worker at the water filtration plant in chicago  but he never missed a day of work  and michelle's mom worked as a secretary  but with those modest jobs  they were able to look after michelle and her brother and ended up sending them to some of the best colleges and universities in the country  and i thought about how that story was true for so many other families all across illinois  and then when i began to run for president  i realized that was true all across america  and so the thing that i loved   i at this point  a cell phone rang i   i the president i  who's calling   i laughter i  is that michelle   i laughter i  that's because she heard all those women were kissing me   i laughter i  she got a little nervous  she's feeling a little jealous   i laughter i  but what all these stories reminded me of is that all across america  people of every walk of life black  white  hispanic  asian  native american it doesn't matter where you come from  there's this central idea that makes this country great  the idea that no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your faith  here in america  if you're willing to work hard  you can make it  you can get ahead   i applause i  you can get ahead  americans  we don't want handouts  we want to work for what we earn  but we do want hard work to pay off   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  we do expect that  if you're willing to put in the effort  you should be able to find a job that pays a living wage  you shouldn't go broke just because you get sick  you should be able to send your kids to a good school  you should retire with dignity and respect  and you should be able to provide your children and  hopefully  your grandchildren with opportunities that you might not even have imagined  that they're going to do even better than you did  that's what america is all about  that's at the heart of the american idea  now  i ran in   because that basic bargain  that belief that hard work should pay off  that it seemed as if that simple american dream was at risk like never before  for more than a decade  it had been slipping away from too many hardworking people  jobs and factories were shipped overseas  folks at the very top were doing better than ever before  but the middle class the folks who are the heartbeat of this country for middle class families and those trying to get into the middle class  it seemed as if paychecks were getting smaller and bills were getting bigger  meanwhile  in washington trillions of dollars were spent on two wars and tax cuts  and we went from record surpluses to record deficits  and on wall street  you had a culture of anything goes that led to reckless bets and ultimately resulted in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  ever since i ran for office  i said that it's going to take more than one year or one term or even one president to solve some of these problems   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  and let's you know what  look  let's face it  there's so much more work to do  this crisis made things that much tougher  and when you go through something as bad as anything since the great depression  it's a challenge to make sure that we get the economy moving and everybody is back to work and people's property values and their homes are back to where they need to be  but when i hear people saying that somehow our best days are behind us  i tell them  you don't know the american people  the courage  the character  the determination of the american people  because as i travel across the country and i meet a small business person who sacrificed some of their own perks and maybe even their own pay to make sure that they could keep all those families on the job  or when i talk about some of autoworkers in michigan and ohio  who were never supposed to be building cars again  but now can't build them fast enough  when i meet men and women in their  s who go back to community colleges  sitting with a bunch of   year olds because they don't give up just because they got laid off and they retrain and suddenly they're finding new jobs in health care or medical technologies or in some advanced manufacturing that spirit  that understanding that we may get knocked down  but we always get back up and that we always believe in our capacity to bring about the kind of changes that keep america moving  that tenacity and determination  that's undiminished  it's still there   i audience member i  praise the lord   i the president i  it is still there  and so there may not be any quick fixes and easy solutions to some of the challenges we face  but we're going to fix them  i have every bit of confidence  in fact  the problem we have right now is not that we don't have good ideas for things like housing and education and making sure that we're bringing down our deficit and protecting seniors' medicare and social security  the problem is not that we don't know how to do it  the problem is we've got a stalemate in washington  you know  i mean  we've got the best scientists  we've got the best universities  we've got the best entrepreneurs  we've got the best system  we've got more diversity and ingenuity and talent coming from every part of the globe  so every other country on earth  they'd be happy to trade places with us  but we do have this stalemate in washington because there are a group of folks who want us to go backwards  i don't believe in going backwards  i believe in going forwards  i believe in going forward   i applause i  i want us to go forward  my opponent and his friends in congress  they've got an economic plan   i audience member i  their economics don't work   i the president i  yes  well  it sounds like you've heard the plan   i laughter i  their plan is to cut taxes more for the wealthy  cut more regulations on banks and insurance companies and unscrupulous lenders  and cut more investments in things like education and research and hope that somehow all that is going to create more prosperity for everybody  now  that's a good theory if we hadn't just tried it  we tried it for a decade before i got elected  and it didn't work  it got us into this mess in the first place  i think most of you  like most of america  understands that america works best not with top down economics  but with a middle out economics  with a bottom up economics  when everybody has opportunity  then everybody does well  including those at the top  that's how we became the most prosperous nation on earth  that's how we built the greatest middle class in history  and it's because i want to restore that basic bargain that i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  i'm running because i don't believe that you can reduce the deficit without asking the wealthiest americans including  by the way  folks like me to give up the tax cuts that they've been benefiting from for the last decade  my opponent doesn't want to just keep those tax cuts  he wants to pile on another   trillion in tax cuts  including a  percent tax cut for every millionaire in the country   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  but wait  it gets better   i laughter i  to pay for this  he'd have to gut job training programs for workers  financial aid for our students  he'd potentially have to raise taxes on the middle class  the folks who can least afford it  he wants to roll back the affordable care act  health care reform  forcing   floridians to pay more for their prescription drugs  he plans to turn medicare into a voucher program  now  understand how that works  if the voucher isn't worth what it takes to buy health insurance in the private marketplace  you're out of luck  you've got to make up the difference  you're on your own  so one independent  nonpartisan study found that under a similar plan  seniors would have to pay nearly   for medicare than they do today  where are you going to get that from  where are you going to get it from    how many people here want to think that's a good idea   i audience members i  no   i the president i to finance tax cuts for folks who don't need them and weren't even asking for them  so  florida  that is wrong  it's wrong to ask you to pay more for medicare so that people who are doing well right now get even more  that's no way to reduce the deficit  we shouldn't be squeezing more money out of our seniors  my plan is to squeeze more money out of the health care system that is being wasted with waste and abuse and fraud  and we've been  by the way  cracking down on medicare fraud harder than just about anybody because those dollars should be going to you and your care  not to folks who are cheating the system   i audience members i   i inaudible i   i the president i   i laughter i  we're going to cut and look  let me tell you  there are some government programs that don't work  and we can't afford to waste money  so we've already made a trillion dollars' worth of cuts  we're willing to cut spending on stuff that is not helping the middle class and not helping us grow  but we've also got to balance that by making sure that everybody's doing their fair share  and by the way  just like we tried their way and it didn't work  the way i'm talking about  we tried that too  under a guy named bill clinton  and we created   million new jobs  and we had a surplus instead of a deficit  and medicare was protected  and social security was protected  and by the way  wealthy people did pretty well too  because when middle class families are doing well and they've got a little money in their pockets  that means they're spending it with the local restaurant and the local business  so suddenly  businesses have more customers and they start hiring more workers  and you get a virtuous cycle where everybody does well  that's the recipe for success  but this isn't the only place where i've got a difference with mr  romney   i laughter i  we talked about the auto industry  mr  romney said  let's  let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  there were a million jobs at stake  so i said  no  let's bet on american workers  let's bet on american manufacturing  and now gm is number one again  and chrysler and ford are on the move  the auto industry has come roaring back  so i want to make sure that what we did with the auto industry  let's do it with manufacturing all across the country  right here in florida  all across the country  let's put people back to work  and one of the ways we can do it is instead of giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the united states and hiring american workers  i want to sell goods around the world made in america  that's what i believe in  that's why i'm running for a second term  i'm running because after a decade of war  it's time for us to do some nation building here at home  america is safer and more respected because of the unbelievable service of our troops  and because of their efforts  we ended the war in iraq as i promised  we've been able to refocus on al qaida and those who caused   and we have decimated their leadership and taken out bin laden  we've been able to set a timeline to end the war in afghanistan  and we've strengthened our alliances and stood with countries that shared our values  i know a lot of people in this community care about the state of israel and we are heartbroken and it's an important time to talk about this because of these barbaric attacks that happened in bulgaria  young people being killed because of this ruthless terrorist attack  and i want everybody here to know  under my administration  we haven't just preserved the unbreakable bond with israel  we have strengthened it  we've stood by israel's side in the face of criticism  our military and intelligence cooperation has never been closer  and obviously  this is a moment of great uncertainty in the middle east given what's happening in syria and what's happening in other places  so now is the time to make sure that we are doing everything we can to protect israel's security  and i want you to know that that's something that should transcend party  that's not a republican or a democratic issue  that is an issue of how we work with one of our closest allies in the world that shares our values and believes in democracy  now  the good news is our alliances are stronger and our homeland is safer because of the courage of our armed forces  but that also means that we've got to take care of our own responsibilities  the idea that anybody who wore the uniform of the united states armed forces is homeless right now is unacceptable  the notion that they should be fighting for a job or a roof over their heads after having fought for us is unacceptable  and that's why we are going to meet that sacred trust and make sure every veteran gets the care that they have earned and the services that they have earned  that's one of the reasons i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  so there's more  there's more  more work to do  i want to take about half of the savings that we've been spending on war  let's rebuild america  let's put workers back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges  rebuilding our ports  you know  i just took a step today that will save shave years off of the renovation of the jacksonville port  all across florida  there are ports that are gateways for trade and commerce and jobs  and we want to accelerate those things  and it's important for the local economy  but it's also important for the american economy  we used to have the best stuff  the best airports  the best roads  the best everything  but we've been slipping because we haven't been making those investments  and you know what happens when you defer maintenance  if you don't fix the roof  what happens  that's going to cost you more later on  why wouldn't we want to put some folks back to work right now rebuilding america  that's good for the economy  it's good for our future  i'm running to make sure america once again has the best education system in the world  i want our schools to hire and reward the best teachers  especially in math and science  i want to give   million more americans the chance to get trained at community colleges for the jobs that local businesses are hiring right now  i want colleges and universities to bring down their tuition so that young people aren't loaded up with debt  higher education isn't a luxury anymore  it's an economic necessity  it may not be at a  year college  but  year   year  you need an advanced degree of some sort to get into the middle class  and we've got to make it affordable for all of our young people  now  me and mr  romney  we've got a lot of differences  and i've just mentioned a few  here in florida  we're all still concerned that the housing market is weak  you're starting to see some signs of life around the country  but it's still a lot of homes underwater  mr  romney's plan is to just let the market bottom out  that's his plan  that's not a solution  that's a problem  now  we've already helped millions of responsible homeowners refinance at historically low rates  refinance their mortgages  so i'm running to make sure that everybody can refinance and save about   money in your pocket that you can use either to build back the equity in your home or spend it at a local business  which will further strengthen the economy  that's a difference between me and mr  romney  i believe it was the right thing to do to pass health care reform  all of you know what it means to have security when it comes to your health care  a lot of folks here may already be on medicare  but imagine if you had been unlucky and ended up getting laid off at the age of   or   and maybe you've already had an illness  and now you're trying to get back in the workforce  but it's taking a long time  and you lose your health insurance  or you get a job that doesn't offer you health insurance  or maybe you're a small business person and you've got to go into the individual market  and it turns out that because of a preexisting condition  you can't get it or it costs so much you could never even afford it  that's not right  that's not who we are  so that's why we passed the affordable care act  it was the right thing to do  the supreme court has now spoken  and we are going to implement this plan because we're moving forward  we're not going backwards  we're not going to go backwards when it comes to telling outstanding servicemembers that they can't serve this country they love just because of who they love  we ended  don't ask  don't tell  it was the right thing to do  we're not going backwards when it comes to the need for immigration reform  we're a nation of laws  but we're also a nation of immigrants  and so we need to have a smart system that says  you know what  those who are willing to work hard and act responsibly  you've got a chance to succeed here in america just like previous generations  and all these things  whether it's bringing manufacturing or construction jobs back or protecting your health care or making sure your grandkids can stay on your their parent's health insurance plan if they don't have a job that provides health insurance or making sure that our veterans are cared for or making sure that young people can afford college all these things go back to that original idea  the idea that if you work hard  you can make it in this country  you can get ahead  that's the promise that our parents and our grandparents made to us  and that's what we now have to pass on to our kids and grandkids  and so over the next   months  the other side is going to spend more money than we've ever seen   i laughter i  and they'll have a bunch of ads with scary voices   i laughter i  and most of what you hear  you can pretty much just go mute i laughter i just press the mute button  that's the good thing about the remote  or you can use the dvr and fast forward   i laughter i  and the reason you don't really have to pay much attention is because these ads are going to say the same thing over and over again  they know the other side knows they can't sell their economic plan  because we tried it and it didn't work  and everybody remembers that  so instead  what they're going to say is  well  you know what  the economy is still bad and it's obama's fault  that's their message over and over again  so it doesn't matter what's on the screen  you know that's what they're saying  plus  some of the pictures of me will be unflattering   i laughter i  my face is all a little distorted  one eye is all droopy   i laughter i  right  i'm looking all grim   i laughter i  so you know what they're saying  now  that may be a way that may be their plan to win an election  but it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to revitalize the middle class  it's not a plan to actually move this country forward  and frankly  i'd be worried if this was my first campaign  but i've been to this rodeo before   i laughter i  and one of the things that gives me confidence is you  the american people know to cut through some nonsense   i audience members i   i inaudible i   i the president i  and i i laughter i this is kind of a wild crowd here  what gives me hope is you  because just like in that first campaign  when i'm now campaigning  i'm traveling around the country  i constantly hear stories that are just like my story  just like my family's stories  all the struggles that previous generations went through folks coming over here as immigrants  in some cases  folks coming in chains but despite heartache and disappointment  and when you think about all those who traveled through ellis island  they didn't know what they were going to find  but what they knew was there was something special about this country   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  and so no matter how hard it was  no matter how tough  they just kept on going  they kept on working  and they understood that this was a country where people were free to pursue their own individual dreams  but that people would still come together as a country  i was saying the other day  we take pride in individual initiative  and like i said  we don't like handouts  we don't expect government to solve every problem  and we don't think the government should help people who don't want to even help themselves  but we also remember that that gi bill that educated so many people  we did that together  hoover dam  golden gate bridge  we built together  the internet we was created because of investments that we made together  that's how we sent a man to the moon together  and so we are not going to abandon those values and those traditions that ultimately made this  the country that we love  so when we tap into those values  those things we know that are right and that are true  then all that other money and all that negativity doesn't matter  all that stuff  that's not going to impact the election  it's going to be up to you  the choice is going to be up to you  and if   i audience member i  we choose you   i the president i  and if you are ready to work  then i'm confident about this election  i feel good about it because you are going to break this stalemate and get things back on track  in   i told you i'm not a perfect man michelle could have told you that i laughter i and i said i wouldn't be a perfect president  no president is  but what i said was i'd always tell you where i stood  i'd always tell you what i thought  and most importantly  i'd wake up every single day fighting as hard as i knew how for you  fighting for you  thinking about you  because i see myself in you  i see myself  i see my grandparents  i see my own kids in you  we're a part of that same story  and so when i'm fighting for you  i'm fighting for my kids and their future  and that's why i've been able to keep that promise  because i still believe in you  and if you still believe in me and you are willing to stand with me and work with me and knock on doors with me and make phone calls with me  i promise you  we will win florida  we will win this election  and together  we will finish what we started and remind the world why america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  everybody  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  oakland  thank you so much  oakland  thank you  okay  good night  thank you   i laughter i  see   i audience member i  we love you  president obama   i the president i  i love you back  thank you  you know  i might want to just stop here   i laughter i  what a nice reception  thank you so much  it is great to be in oakland  california  wonderful to be at the fox theater  there are a couple of people i want to acknowledge  first of all  one of the finest members of congress we've got  your own barbara lee is in the house  another outstanding member of the california delegation  pete stark is here  your own mayor  jean quan  is here  ledisi is in the house  and nnamdi asomugha now  i know he plays for the eagles  but he's from around here  so you've got to give him a big round of applause  well  oakland  this is my last political campaign  it is  no  it's i promise you i'm term limited after this   i laughter i  and because this is my last political campaign  it's had me thinking these days  you get a little nostalgic  and you start thinking about your first political campaigns  when i was running as a state senator in illinois and had to xerox my own flyers  go to kinko's   i laughter i  and then michelle and i would go out  and we'd be knocking on doors on a saturday morning  and then  when i ran for the united states senate  i'd drive all across illinois  which isn't quite as big as california  but is a big state  and you didn't have gps back then  and i didn't have marine one i laughter i so i'd be driving myself  sometimes i'd have a staffer who would make me make phone calls while i was driving and  which was you're not supposed to do anymore  but i laughter i  and since i didn't have gps  we'd have those maps that you actually had to fold  young people wouldn't understand this  but you'd have to fold them and then fold them back again   i laughter i  and i'd get lost  and  then once i got to the event  i'd have to park the car myself  and sometimes i couldn't find a parking spot  and so i'd end up being late  and if it was raining  i'd have to fumble with my umbrella  and i'd come in kind of drenched  but i have such good memories about those campaigns because what inspired me wherever i went i'd be in inner cities or rural communities  you'd see folks from every walk of life  rich  poor  urban  suburban  black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  gay  straight  you name it wherever we went  there would be a common thread to people's stories  so i'd meet an elderly veteran  and he'd remind me of my grandfather who fought in world war ii  he was a man who grew up during the depression and served his country and  when he came home  was rewarded with a chance to go to college on the gi bill  and i think about my grandmother  who while my grandfather was gone  already had my mom was a baby and was rosie the riveter  she worked on a bomber assembly line  and when they married  after my grandfather came back  they were able to get a home with the help of an fha loan  and if i met a working couple  i think about michelle's parents  especially her dad  who almost never missed a day of work at the water filtration plant where he worked a blue collar job even though he had ms  so he needed two canes to walk  and he had to wake up an hour earlier than everybody else just to punch in on time  but he wouldn't miss work  and michelle's mom worked as a secretary  but even though they didn't have a lot  they were able to support a family  and michelle and her brother ended up getting a great education and would be able to go as far as their dreams would take them  and then i'd meet a single mom somewhere  and i'd think about my own mom  who raised my sister and me  with the help of my grandparents  because my dad left when i was a baby  and my mom didn't have a lot of money  but she worked hard  and she went to school at the same time as she worked  all so that she could give her two kids the best education possible  and so the people that i'd meet in these campaigns  these early campaigns of mine  and what i've experienced ever since as i've traveled around the country  is that as different as those folks seemed on the surface despite having all these different backgrounds  despite the fact that some were republicans and some were democrats and some were independents all of them shared this belief that's at the core of the american experience that binds us together  the idea that no matter who you are  no matter where you come from  no matter what you look like  this place  america  is a place where you can make it if you try  this is a place where hard work allows you to achieve your dreams  we don't expect handouts as americans  but we do expect hard work to pay off  we expect responsibility to be rewarded  we believe that if you put in enough effort  you should be able to find a job that pays the bills and supports a family  you should be able to buy your own home and count on health care if you get sick and retire with dignity and respect  and most of all  that you should be able to give your children an education that gives them an even better shot than you had  and we're here today for the same reason that so many of us came together in   because this basic bargain  this core american dream  is at risk  and it's been at risk like never before  for more than a decade before i was sworn in  it had been slipping away from too many hard working people  jobs in factories were shipped overseas  folks at the top were doing better than ever  but middle class families saw their paychecks get smaller  saw their bigs their bills get bigger  and in washington  trillions were spent on two wars and two tax cuts that took us from record surpluses to record deficits  while on wall street a culture of anything goes led to the worst financial and economic crisis since the great depression  ever since i first ran for this office  i've said that it will take more than one year or one term or even one president to restore the dream that this country built  and obviously  the crisis that we went through made it that much harder  but for those cynics who say that our best days are behind us  they haven't witnessed the everyday courage and the character of the american people  they have not met the small business owners in minnesota who chose to sacrifice some of their own perks and pay just to avoid laying off a single worker during the recession  they haven't met those folks in the auto plants in michigan and ohio that were never supposed to build another car again  but now they can't build them fast enough  they haven't talked to the factory workers that i meet in north carolina or ohio  in their fifties sometimes  decided that when one industry left town  they'd go back to school  one woman i met  she started going back to community college to study biotech  she was in her mid fifties  so she's sitting there with all these kids  and i talked to her about why she decided to go back to school  she said  not only do i expect that this will help me get a job  but also because  she said  i want to make sure that my kids know never to give up on their dreams  so  oakland  there are no quick fixes  there are no easy solutions to some of the challenges we face  but there is no doubt that we have the capacity to meet them  we've got the world's best workers  the world's best entrepreneurs  we've got the best scientists  we've got the best researchers  we've got the best colleges and universities  we are a young nation  and we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity that comes from every corner of the globe  you can see it here in oakland  no matter what the naysayers tell us  there is not a country on this earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states of america  so i continue to feel as optimistic  as hopeful about the capacity for us to institute meaningful change  as i ever have been  what's standing in our way right now despite all the progress we've made despite the health care bill that we passed  despite wall street reform  despite saving the auto industry despite all that  what's holding us back right now is not the lack of big ideas  it's what's going on in washington  this uncompromising view that the only path forward is to go back to the same top down economics that got us into this mess in the first place   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  my opponent's entire plan  his whole plan for economic renewal  is more tax cuts for the wealthy   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  more regulation eliminating regulations for banks and corporations that we put in place after the crisis   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  cutting more investments in things like education and research   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and somehow this is supposed to create jobs and prosperity for everybody  that's what mitt romney believes  that's what his allies in washington believe  but here's the problem  we tried that  and it didn't work  it's not what you believe  it's not what i believe  it's not what most americans believe will actually make a difference  this country was not built from the top down  it was built from the middle class out  from the bottom up  that's how we became the most prosperous nation in the history of the world  that's the path that you can choose for america in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  so we've got two contrasting visions for where we want to take the country  and frankly  the other side knows they can't sell their ideas  so what they're going to do is try to distort my vision  earlier today governor romney was at it again  knowingly twisting my words around to suggest that i don't value small businesses   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  look  in politics  we all tolerate a certain amount of spin  i understand these are the games that get played in political campaigns  although when folks just  like  omit entire sentences of what you said i laughter i they start kind of splicing and dicing  you may have gone a little over the edge there  but look  there's actually a real choice at stake here  i believe with all my heart that it is the drive and the ingenuity of americans who start businesses that lead to their success  i always have  and i always will  the ability for somebody who's willing to work hard  put in their sweat and their sacrifice to turn their idea into a profitable business  that's the nature of america  that's what helped make our economy the envy of the world  i've always said don't bet against american workers  don't bet against american ingenuity  and i believe that the free market is the greatest source of prosperity in our history  but i also believe that if you talk to any business owner  they'll tell you that what also helps them succeed  alongside all their hard work  all their great ideas  is the ability to hire workers with the right skills and education  what helps them succeed is the ability to ship and sell their products on new roads and bridges and ports and wireless networks  what helps them succeed is having access to cutting edge technology  which  like the internet  often starts with publicly funded research and development  and what helps them succeed is a strong and growing middle class who can buy the products that they're selling  every business needs customers  now  for two centuries  we've made these investments  not as democrats or republicans  but as americans who understand what it takes to give our people and our businesses the best possible chance at success  but my opponent disagrees  mr  romney's plan is to gut these investments  just so that he can give more tax breaks to millionaires and companies that are shipping jobs overseas  he thinks that's the best way to grow the economy   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  he thinks that's the best way to help small businesses  and i've got to tell you  oakland  he is dead wrong  we did not build this country from the top down  we built this country together  individual entrepreneurs taking advantage of opportunities and putting their sweat and tears into it and all of us making investments in things like public schools and public colleges and universities  the hoover dam and the golden gate bridge  that's how we sent a man to the moon  that's how we saw medical breakthroughs that saved millions of lives  if mr  romney does not understand that  then he doesn't understand what it takes to build an economy where everybody has a shot to succeed  from the worker who punches a clock to the entrepreneur who wants to take a chance on a new idea  there's only one way to grow our economy for the long run  that's what we're fighting for  that is what this election is about  that's why i'm running for a second term as president  i'm running because i believe you can't reduce the deficit which is a serious problem  we've got to deal with it but we can't reduce it without asking folks like me  who have been incredibly blessed  to give up the tax cuts that we've been getting for a decade  i'll cut out government spending that's not working  that we can't afford  but i'm also going to ask anybody making over   a year  to go back to the tax rates they were paying under bill clinton  back when our economy created   million new jobs  the biggest budget surplus in history  and everybody did well  just like we've tried their plan  we've tried our plan  and it worked  that's the difference  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term  when the american auto industry was on the brink of collapse  more than   million jobs were on the line  governor romney said  we should just let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i refused to turn my back on a great industry and american workers  i bet on american workers  i bet on american manufacturing  three years later  the american auto industry has come roaring back  and what happens in the auto industry can happen in other industries  i want to invest in advanced manufacturing  high tech manufacturing jobs  i want to make sure they don't take root in china and germany  i want to make sure they take root right here in oakland and cleveland and raleigh and richmond  and governor romney  his main calling card in this election is  i've got private sector experience  well  you know what  his experience has been investing in companies that were called  pioneers  in the business of outsourcing  he wants to keep giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i'm a big proponent of insourcing  i want to end these tax breaks and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in oakland  right here in the united states  making products that we sell around the world  stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's what i believe  that's why i'm running for a second term  i'm running because after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building here at home  because of the courage and the selflessness of our men and women in uniform  america is safer and more respected than before  because of their sacrifices  we've been able to end the war in iraq  as i promised to do  we've been able to refocus our efforts on those who actually carried out the   attacks and gone after al qaida and bin laden  we have set a timetable to transition out of afghanistan and are bringing our troops home  and now  as we wind down a decade of war  i want to make sure that this is a country where we care for our veterans and serve our veterans as well as they've served us  because they haven't they shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads  when they've been fighting for us  building our economy is part of our national security  so my plan would take about half of the money that we're no longer spending on war  let's use it to put people back to work  rebuilding our roads  our runways  our ports  laying broadband lines into rural communities  updating our wireless networks  let's create a veterans jobs corps so we can put our returning heroes back to work as cops and firefighters in communities that need them most  that's the america we want to build  that's the choice in this election  i'm running to make sure america once again leads the world in educating our kids and training our workers  i want to help our schools hire and reward the best teachers  especially in math and science  i want to give   million more americans the opportunity to go to community colleges and learn the skills that local businesses are hiring for right now  i want to get colleges and universities to bring down the cost of tuition  because a higher education is no longer a luxury  it is an economic necessity in the  st century  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  across the board in this election  there's a choice  housing is still a problem all across the country  mr  romney's plan is to let foreclosures hit bottom  that's not a solution  that's part of the problem  so my administration has already helped more than a million responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages  i want to give every homeowner the chance to save   a year  take advantage of historically low rates  that's an example of the difference in this election  i continue to believe that nobody in america should go broke just because they get sick  we fought to get health care passed  it was the right thing to do  the supreme court has spoken  and we are going forward  and for all the misinformation out there  let me just make this plain  if you've got health insurance  the only thing that you're going to get out of this is a lot more security dealing with your insurance company  because they won't be able to mess around with you just because of some fine print  impose lifetime limits  suddenly  your health care is not there when you need it most  you will have security if you already have health insurance  young people will be able to stay on their parent's plans till they're   years old  women won't be getting charged more than men  and you'll be getting free preventive care  seniors will see the cost of their prescription drugs go down  if you don't have health insurance  we're going to help you get it  it's the right thing to do  and look  that's not the only difference that we're going to have in this campaign  now is not the time to refight the same political battles we've had over the past   years  it was important to get wall street reform in place  to make sure that consumers aren't being taken advantage of by unscrupulous mortgage brokers or payday lenders  the other side wants to roll it back  we're not going backwards  we're going forwards  ending  don't ask  don't tell  was the right thing to do  we're not going back  we're going forward  making sure that women control their own health care choices is the right thing to do  we're not going back  we're going forward  expanding pell grants for young people  right thing to do  we're not going back  we're going forward  oakland  all these things whether it's making sure every child gets a great education  making sure that we're investing in our infrastructure  making sure that we're attracting advanced manufacturing  making sure that health care is secure  making sure everybody is treated fairly and not discriminated against  making sure that our veterans are getting the benefits that they've earned all these things tie together  they're all part of a vision that says you can make it if you try  they're all central to the idea that made this country great  that if you work hard  you can get ahead  it's the same promise our parents and our grandparents passed down to us  it's the promise we've got to pass on to our kids and our grandkids  now  over the course of the next   months  the other side will spend more money than we have ever seen on ads that basically tell you the same thing you've been hearing from them for months  like i said  they don't really have an economic plan  they know their economic theory is not going to sell  so really what their ads all boil down to is  the economy is not where it should be  and it's obama's fault  it's very simple  easy to summarize  you will continue to see a variation on this theme   i laughter i  and i guess it may be a plan to try to win an election  but it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to revitalize the economy  it's not a plan to rebuild our middle class  and you know  the nice thing is  as i see all of you here tonight  it reminds that we've been outspent before  we've been counted out more times than i can remember  but through every one of my campaigns  what's always given me hope is you  your ability to cut through the nonsense  your ability to focus on what's important  when americans come together and they focus on what's true and they focus on what's right and they think about what's best in the story of their own families all the struggles their parents and grandparents went through  some coming here as immigrants  some coming here through no choice of their own  some working in mills or factories  some working out on farms  folks coming here and not knowing what to expect  but understanding there was something special about america  knowing that here there was embedded in the very charters of this country the idea that everybody had certain inalienable rights  endowed by their creator  life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness  the idea that we're free to pursue our own individual dreams  and yet  even as we express this incredible self reliance  this rugged individualism  that we can also come together as one american family  as a more perfect union  our parents  our grandparents  our great grandparents  what they were fighting for  they knew that the middle class  it wasn't about a certain amount of money in your bank account  it was about knowing that you work hard and you could succeed and you could have some security and your kids could leapfrog over you  do things you couldn't imagine  and that there would be times where we stumbled and had setbacks  but in america  you got a second chance and a third chance  as long as you just didn't give up  you kept on going  when we tap that spirit  when we tap into that idea that it's not a matter of bloodlines  it's not a matter of everybody being of the same race or the same faith  but it has to do with a creed that binds us together  when we focus on that  then all this other money doesn't matter  all those negative ads don't matter  what matters is you  when you come together  change happens  when you come together  you inspire me  i told you in   i wasn't a perfect man and i wouldn't be a perfect president  but i also said that i'd always tell you what i thought  i'd always tell you where i stood  and most importantly  i would wake up every single day fighting as hard as i knew how  to make your lives a little bit better  because i saw myself in you  in your grandparents  i saw my grandparents  in your kids  i saw malia  and i saw sasha  in your story  i saw my own  and  oakland  i've kept that promise  every day that i've had the privilege of having this office  i have been thinking about you and fighting as hard as i knew how to make sure that your hard work pays off  and now i'm asking you for your help  now i'm asking you for your vote  now i'm asking you to knock on doors and make phone calls and do all the things that we did in   and if you're willing to stand with me and fight with me  then i promise you  we will finish what we started  and we will grow this economy and build the middle class and remind the world just why it is that the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  portland  thank you  well  it is great to be back in portland  and i just want to point out every time i come to portland  it's like   degrees and sunny   i laughter i  i just want to make that point   i laughter i  i'm not saying that i'm the reason   i laughter i  but there does seem to be a correlation between   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  thank you  thank you  a couple of people i want to acknowledge because they're doing outstanding work first of all  your excellent governor  john kitzhaber  he's making a difference  former governor barbara roberts  we love barbara  secretary of state kate brown is here  kate is making sure here in oregon  everybody gets a chance to vote  we like that in her  mayor sam adams is here  i want to thank somebody who put so much work into this event  terry bean  give terry a big round of applause  and even if you are a ducks fan  i want you to give a big round of applause to the best brother in law anybody could ever hope for and an outstanding basketball coach of the oregon state beavers  craig robinson  so no offense  ducks fans  but i got to root for family   i laughter i  all right  now  if folks have chairs  feel free to sit down  if you don't i see a few do  if not  just keep make sure to bend your legs so you don't i laughter i you don't faint  it is wonderful to be back in portland  one of my favorite events ever was the rally we had by the water in portland   years ago  it was a day just like today  it was just as pretty as could be  and there were folks out kayaking and out in boats  and you just could see as far as it was just beautiful  and the people could not have been warmer  and so i just want to thank all of you for being so welcoming  this is my last political campaign  no  i'm term limited  that's the way it works   i laughter i  and it got me thinking about some of my first political campaigns  when i was first running for the state senate  and craig will remember this because we'd have to go to kinko's to print out flyers   i laughter i  and he'd be drafted  along with michelle and some friends  and we'd just go around neighborhoods knocking on doors  and then later  when i ran for the united states senate  which was a loftier office  obviously  but i didn't have a loftier infrastructure around me so we didn't have marine one  we did not have air force one  i drove myself in my car  usually with one staff person  and back then  young people  you will not remember this  but there were these things called maps  because we did not have gps   i laughter i  and so and they were on paper  and you'd have to fold them  you'd unfold them and then trying to fold them back was really difficult   i laughter i  and i'd get lost because illinois is a big state  and i'd take the wrong turn and wind up in the wrong town  and when i finally got to the event  i'd have to look for my own parking spot and i laughter i you'd end up being late  and sometimes  it would be raining  and you had to see if you could find the umbrella somewhere in the back with all the junk that was there   i laughter i  but i have such fond memories of those campaigns because when i travel throughout illinois you'd go to inner cities  you'd go to rural  small farm towns  you'd go to suburbs  you'd meet folks from every walk of life  every race  every faith  every background  every income level what i'd heard are stories that reminded me of my own family's stories  so i'd see a retired veteran  and he'd remind me of my grandfather  and i'd think back about my grandfather fighting in world war ii in patton's army  and while my grandmother was working on a bomber assembly line  and how when he came back  he was able to go to college on the gi bill and my grandparents were able to buy their first home with the help of an fha loan  and i'd think about the incredible journey that they had traveled because they were lucky enough to live here in america  and i'd meet a working couple  and i'd think about craig and michelle's parents  their dad  by the time i met him  could barely walk because he had ms  so he had to use two canes  and he's have to wake up an hour earlier than everybody else just to get dressed to make sure that he punched the clock on time  he worked a blue collar job at the water filtration plant in chicago  and craig and michelle's mom worked as a secretary  but they had such strong values and such love for their family and such a sense of responsibility that they were able to give their kids everything they needed to thrive and succeed  and i'd think back to what an incredible country it was where craig's mom and dad would be able to watch him succeed and michelle become the first lady of the united states  eventually  and i'd meet a single mom and i'd think about my own mom  my dad left before i even knew him and so she had to raise me and my sister and work and go to school at the same time  but because she was able to get grants and scholarships  she was able not only to get a great education herself and  ultimately  help women around the world develop themselves  but she was also able to give me and my sister this incredible education and these incredible opportunities  and so everywhere i'd go around illinois  and eventually  everywhere i went as a presidential candidate  what i'd consistently see is this running thread  this core theme  this basic bargain that is at the heart of this country  and it can be described very simply  it's that here in america  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your last name is  no matter where you worship  here in america  if you're willing to work hard  you can make it  here in america  if you are acting responsibly  you can succeed  here in america  this basic notion that if you're willing to make an effort  you can find a job that pays a living wage and allows you to support a family  that you can get a home that you can call your own  that you can have the security that if somebody in your family gets sick you won't go bankrupt  that you can send your kids to a good school  you can retire with some dignity and respect  and that your kids can do better than you ever imagined  that's what america is about  that's what has made us the envy of the world  this idea that here you can make it and that everybody gets a fair shot and that everybody does their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules  that's what built the greatest middle class in the history of the world  that's what made us an economic superpower  and i'm here today for the same reason that i came   years ago  when i ran in   it was because that basic bargain  that basic notion that you could make it here if you try  that had started to slip away for more and more people  we've gone through a decade in which people were working harder  but making less money  while the cost of everything from college education to health care were going up  we had fought two wars on a credit card  we had taken a surplus  and because of tax cuts that weren't paid for  we had turned them into deficits  and it all culminated in incredible recklessness on wall street that resulted in the worst financial crisis and economic crisis in our history  and so in an environment in which jobs and factories were being shipped overseas and folks at the top were doing very well while middle class families were struggling  we came together saying that  yes  it would take more than one year or one term or maybe even one president to turn this thing around  but we were going to fight for the kinds of changes that would ensure we got back to that basic american promise  that basic idea that if you work hard in this country you can make it  now  this crisis has been deeper and more brutal than  i think  anybody back then anticipated  but over the last   years  everything i've done everything my administration has done has stayed focused on that goal  and so where we were losing   jobs a month when i was sworn into office  we've been creating jobs now for almost   years straight    million new jobs    in manufacturing  the fastest manufacturing growth since the  s  we've helped to make sure that small businesses were able to survive this brutal recession and invested in them  and so we've made progress  but we still have millions of folks who are out of work and in homes that are underwater  so we've got a lot more work to do  understanding all that  though  when i hear cynics say that or suggest that our best days are behind us  i've got to tell them  you haven't witnessed the character of the american people  one of the great privileges of being president is you meet people all across the country  just like i used to meet folks all across illinois  and when you see the character and the grit and the determination of the american people  you can't help but be optimistic  anybody who thinks that our best days are behind us  they haven't met the small business owners in minnesota who chose to sacrifice some of their own perks and pay just to avoid laying off a single worker during the recession  they haven't been to auto plants in michigan or ohio that were never supposed to build another car again and now can't build them fast enough  the cynics  they must not have met the workers that i meet  a factory worker in her fifties in north carolina  who decided that  when the furniture industry left town  she'd get her degree in biotechnology from a local community college  she said  not just to get a job of the future  but also to show her kids that in this country  we don't give up  if we get knocked down  we pick ourselves back up  and we can succeed and achieve our dreams  so there are no quick fixes or easy solutions to some of the challenges we face  they built up over decades  and we have begun to move this country in the right direction  but i have no doubt that we got the capacity to meet every single one of these challenges  we've got the best workers in the world and the best entrepreneurs  we've got the best scientists and the best researchers  the best colleges and the best universities  we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity that's coming from all around the globe  every corner  and no matter what the naysayers may tell us  there's not a country on earth that wouldn't trade places gladly with the united states of america  so what's standing in our way  for all the progress we've made  what's preventing us from making even more progress is politics  it's what's going on in washington  it is a stalemate in which one side has an uncompromising view that the only path forward is to go back to the stuff that didn't work before  the same top down economics that got us into this mess in the first place  i disagree with them  i think they are wrong  at stake in this election are two fundamentally different visions about how we move this country forward  they believe in top down economics  i believe in middle out economics  i believe in bottom up economics  i believe we're all in this together  that's what i'm fighting for  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  let me give you a few examples of the choice because all of you are going to ultimately be the ones who break this stalemate  tomorrow the senate is going to vote on a bill that says that if you earn less than   a year  your taxes will not go up next year by a single dime  now  members of both parties say that they agree this should happen so that our families and our businesses have a little more security and certainty going forward  which would be good for the economy  but of course  we are dealing in washington  the only place where people agree on something and still can't get it done  so republicans in congress  they've decided apparently that they're not going to let this bill pass  despite the fact that   percent of americans make   a year or less  so we could provide   percent of americans certainty that their taxes would not go up despite the fact that this would be good for the economy and investment climate they've decided to hold middle class tax cuts hostage until we also agree to spend another   trillion on tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires  folks who don't need tax breaks  and frankly  many of them aren't even asking for them   i audience members   i boo   i the president i  now  governor romney doesn't just approve of this strategy  he wants to import this into the white house  his economic plan is and this is the entire gist of his economic plan is to cut more taxes for the most wealthy americans  to cut more regulations for banks and corporations including regulations we just put in place in response to the worst financial crisis we've had in our lifetimes to cut more investments in things like education and research  all with the hopes that somehow this is going to create more jobs and prosperity  that's what mitt romney believes  that's what his allies in congress believe  now  there's one problem with that  it is an economic theory   i laughter i  the hitch is that we tried this  as bill clinton put it a couple of weeks ago  this is exactly what was done before i took office   except on steroids   i laughter i  and it didn't work  so it's not what you believe will grow the economy  it's not what i believe will grow the economy  it's not what most americans  regardless of party  believe will grow the economy  this country was not built that way  from the top down  it was built from the middle out  it was built from the bottom up  it was built because incredible self reliance and rugged individualism and entrepreneurship and risk taking was rewarded  and it was built because we invested in great schools and great universities and we put rules of the road in place to make sure that everybody was being treated fairly  that's how we became the most prosperous nation on earth  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  to go back to what works  and by the way  let me just point out that the approach that i'm talking about has also been tested  just like their theories have been tested and didn't work  my theories have been tested  the last time they were tried was by a guy named bill clinton  and we created   million new jobs  went from deficits to surplus  and we created a lot of millionaires to boot   i laughter i  the well off did well because they had a lot of customers   i laughter i  that's how we've grown our economy  in some ways  the other side understands that their theories aren't particularly popular  so rather than explain them clearly  they're going to spend most of their time trying to distort what i say  earlier today governor romney was at it again  he has been twisting my words around to suggest that i don't value small business  now  keep in mind  in politics  you have to endure a certain amount of spin  everybody does it  i understand that  those are the games that are played in campaigns  although i have to say  when people omit entire sentences from a speech i laughter i and they start splicing and dicing  they may have tipped a little bit over their skis  they may have gone over the edge here   i laughter i   i audience member   i i inaudible i his tax returns   i laughter i   i the president i  but there's a real choice here  as i said  i believe with all my heart that it is the drive and ingenuity of americans who start businesses that lead to their success  and by the way  that's why i've cut taxes on small businesses   times since i've been president  i believe the ability for somebody who is willing to work hard and sweat and sacrifice to turn their idea into a profitable business  that's what makes us such a robust  dynamic economy  we prize that  but i also believe that if you talk to any business owner  small or large  they'll tell you what also helps them succeed alongside their hard work  their initiative  their great ideas  is the ability to hire workers with the right skills and the right education  what helps them succeed is the ability to ship and sell their products on new roads and bridges and ports and wireless networks  what helps them succeed is having access to cutting edge technology  which like the internet often starts with publicly funded research and development  and what helps them succeed is a strong and growing middle class so they've got a broader base of customers  and for two centuries  we've made these investments  not just democrats  but republicans as well  this was an american idea  the idea that what it takes to give our people and businesses the best possible chance at success involves individual initiative  but it involves us working together as a nation to create these platforms for success  to expand opportunity  and mr  romney disagrees with this  and he is entitled to his opinion  but the approach that he is talking about is not going to help small businesses  and it's not going to create more markets for large businesses  he is wrong  we did not build this country on our own  we built it together  and if mr  romney doesn't understand that  then he doesn't understand what it takes to grow this economy in the  st century for everybody  let me give you another example because this is going to be discussed over the next   months the issue of debt and deficits  now  we've got to reduce our debt  and we've got to reduce our deficits  i  when i came into office  had a trillion dollars of deficit waiting at my doorstep  and obviously  the recession made it worse  but we've got to take this seriously over the long term  the question is  how do we reduce it in a balanced way that promotes economic growth  i believe you can't reduce the deficit without asking folks like me who have been incredibly blessed by this country to give up a little bit of the tax cuts that they've been enjoying for a decade  particularly since we're the ones who've gained most of the growth in productivity over the last decade or two  we've done well  we can afford to give a little back  so i'm going to cut government spending that we can't afford  not every government program works  it's got to be tested  and if it doesn't work  if it's not helping to grow the economy and give people opportunity  we can't afford it in this environment  but i'm also going to ask folks who make over   a year to go back to the tax cuts or the tax rates that we had under bill clinton  now  mitt romney has a different theory  he actually wants to cut taxes by an additional   trillion  and the math is hard to figure   i laughter i  it's hard to figure how you reduce the deficit by blowing an additional  trillion hole in the deficit  and the only way you can pay for it is not only to slash and gut investments in education and research and infrastructure  it's not only cutting back on the social safety net for vulnerable families  it's not only that you've got to voucherize medicare  as he's proposed but you also ultimately over the long term end up having to impose a greater tax burden on the middle class  that's not how to grow the economy  that's part of the debate that we're going to be having over the next   months  and if you ask most americans and you break it down in that way  they'll agree that we should not see a bunch of teacher layoffs or middle class taxes go up to pay for a tax break for me  that's part of the reason i'm running for a second term as president  let me tell you some things that will work  when the american auto industry was on the brink of collapse and more than   million jobs were on the line  governor romney said  let's  let detroit go bankrupt  i said let's bet on american workers and american ingenuity  and now gm is back on top  and ford and chrysler are building more cars than ever  and so what i've said is  let's not stop at detroit  let's not stop at the auto industry  let's make sure that we're promoting american advanced manufacturing all across the country  and let's change our tax code so that we are providing tax breaks to companies not that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in oregon  right here in the united states of america  and putting american workers back to work making american products  that's why i'm running for a second term  i'm running because after a decade of war  i think it's time for us to do some nation building here at home  that will grow our economy  because of the outstanding efforts of our men and women in uniform  we were able to end the war in iraq  as i promised  because of their outstanding efforts  we were able to refocus on those who actually carried out the   attacks  and al qaida is on the run  and we got bin laden  in afghanistan  we've blunted the taliban's momentum  and now we are beginning to transition so that afghans are in the lead for their own security  and we are beginning to bring our troops home  and so now the question is  what are they coming home to  as long as i'm commander in chief  this country will serve and care for our veterans the same way that they served us  because nobody who fought for american should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  but what will also help our veterans is what will help our entire economy  and that is making the investments that will help us grow  i want to take half of the money that we're saving on war  and let's put people back to work a whole bunch of hard hats out there rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our schools  laying broadband lines into rural communities  expanding our wireless networks  building high speed rail  that's what's going to help build america  i'm running to make sure that america once again leads the world when it comes to educating our kids  i want to help our schools hire and train and retain the best teachers  especially in math and science  i want to create   million more slots for community colleges to train workers  including folks who've been laid off  for the jobs that local businesses are hiring right now  and i want to make sure that we continue to work on reducing the cost of college for every young person in america  because in the  st century a higher education is not a luxury  it is an economic necessity that everybody should be able to afford  that's why i'm running for a second term  we're starting to see glimmers of the housing market improve in some markets  but in a lot of places it's still a big drag on the economy  so what i've said is let's make sure that every family can refinance at these historically low rates  save an average family   which they will then spend  and we'll expand our economy and strengthen the housing market  mr  romney's proposal is to let the foreclosure market bottom out  i don't think that is a plan  that is the problem  and yes  i believe that in america nobody should go bankrupt because they get sick  we passed the affordable care act  the supreme court has spoken  we are now implementing it    million people will have health insurance that didn't have it before  everybody who has health insurance will have greater security  women will have control of their health care choices  that's the right thing to do  we're not going backwards  we're going forwards  on almost every issue  there's a contrast  i believe we did the right thing in ending  don't ask  don't tell  i believe that fairness is a hallmark of this country  mr  romney disagrees when it comes to  don't ask  don't tell  but we're not going backwards  we're going forwards  mr  romney wants to get rid of funding for planned parenthood  i think that is a bad idea  i've got two daughters  i want them to control their own health care choices  we're not going backwards  we're going forwards  and all these things whether it's investing in clean energy and making sure that solar panels and wind turbines are built here in the united states of america  whether it's making sure that health care is there for people who are working hard and doing the responsible thing  whether it's making sure all our young people have access to the higher education that they need all these things tie together  it goes back to that central idea the promise that if you work hard  you can get ahead the same promise that our parents and our grandparents passed down to us and that we now have a responsibility to pass on to our children and our grandchildren  now  over the next   months  the other side will spend more money than we've ever seen on ads  almost all of them negative  they'll tell you the same thing that you've been hearing for months  as i said  they can't sell their own ideas  so they're going to go after us  and you can boil down their message very simply  the economy is still struggling  and it's obama's fault  that's what they will repeat  there will be a lot of variations  but that's going to be their basic message  and that may be a plan to win an election  it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to revive the middle class  they don't have a plan  i do  and although obviously  when folks are writing   million checks to run negative ads against you  it's get your attention  i've been outspent before  we've been counted out before  but what gives me hope is that when it counts  the american people can cut through the nonsense  and they can focus in on what's true and what's right  they remember the stories of their own families  you remember the stories of parents or grandparents or great grandparents who came here as immigrants  some who came here not of their own accord  folks who might have worked on farms or in the mines or in a factory  but understood there was something special about this country that meant your circumstances weren't determined by your birth  that there was something around the corner  something on the horizon that you could strive towards  and they didn't always know what to expect  but they understood that that is what made america special  that in our central charter there was this idea that we were endowed with certain inalienable rights by our creator life and liberty and this pursuit of happiness not the guarantee of success every time  understanding we'd be knocked down sometimes  but this idea that we could pursue happiness  and our parents  grandparents  they understood being middle class  it wasn't just a matter of how much money you had in your bank account  it was a matter of values  understanding that you weren't going to get a handout  that you had to take responsibility  but if you did  you'd have a shot  you'd have a fair shot  that's what they understood  and that's what they passed on to us  and when the american people latch on to that idea  when they focus on it  when you guys  as you did in   understand that that's what's at stake  you can't be stopped  you make change happen  and so sometimes  i'm asked  mr  president  you've got a pretty tough job  what gets you up every morning  it's you  you guys still inspire me  i still believe in you  and some of you may remember in   i tried to not make promises i couldn't keep  but i made one promise  i said  you know  i'm not a perfect man michelle will tell you that i laughter i i am not going to be a perfect president  but i can promise you this  i will always tell you where i stand  i will always tell you what i think  and i will wake up every single day fighting as hard as i know how for you  because i see myself in you  in your grandparents  i see my grandparents  and in your kids  i see my kids  your story is my story  that's what i'm fighting for  that's why i'm running again  i still believe in you  and if you still believe in me and are willing to stand with me and knock on doors with me and make phone calls with me  we'll finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why america is the greatest nation on earth  thank you  god bless you  god bless america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  how's it going  big easy  oh  it is good to be in new orleans  now  i got to admit i was thinking about just blowing everything off and going and getting something to eat   i laughter i   i audience member i  where we going   i the president i  say where we going  huh   i laughter i  i don't know  you tell me  this is your town   i laughter i   i at this point  members of the audience yelled out places to go i   i the president i  huh  all right  well  let me tell you  the next time i come down  drinks are on me  we'll all go party  so i applause i but until then  we got a little work to do  couple of folks i want to acknowledge  first of all  your outstanding mayor  mitch landrieu in the house  congressman cedric richmond is in the house  state senator karen carter peterson is in the house  one of my favorite actors  a great friend  and a big booster of new orleans  wendell pierce is here  give it up for terence blanchard and his band  and i'm not the only out of town visitor here today  we also have the outstanding mayor of philadelphia  mayor michael nutter is here  give him a big round of applause   i audience members i  and your volunteers   i the president i  and your volunteers my volunteers are all here  and you are all here  we're happy about that  thank you  now  this is my last political campaign  you know  i'm term limited  you only get two of these  but it has made me a little nostalgic  it makes me think about some of my first political campaigns   i audience members i  fired up  ready to go   i the president i  you know  when i first started in politics  i was a law professor  i was practicing civil rights law  and then i decided to run for the state senate in my area  and i didn't have a lot of backup  so we'd have to go to kinko's and print up fliers   i laughter i  and michelle and me and some friends  we'd just go knocking on doors  and then when i ran for the united states senate illinois is a big state so we had to drive around all over the place  but i didn't have marine one or air force one or a motorcade  we had me i laughter i in my car  i'd usually have a staff person with me  and the young people  you wouldn't understand this  but back then we had to use these things called maps   i laughter i  so they were pieces of paper  and you had to unfold them and try to figure out where you were going  and then you had to try to figure out how to fold them back   i laughter i  and we would travel all across the state  and i'd go to inner cities and farm towns and suburban areas  and you'd meet people from all walks of life  all income levels  and what was interesting  what inspired me  what made me realize that this might be a worthy pursuit was the sense that wherever i went  no matter how different people looked on the surface  there was a common thread to their story  and it connected with my story  so if i saw an elderly couple  they'd remind me of my grandparents  and i'd think about my grandfather  who fought in world war ii and then came home  my grandmother  during the war  worked on a bomber assembly line  like rosie the riveter  but when my grandfather came back he was able to get a college education because of the gi bill  and they were able to buy their first home with the help of an fha loan  and i'd think about the journey they had traveled and everything that that generation had done for america  but also what america had done for them  and sometimes  i'd meet a single mom  and i'd think about my mom  my dad left  and i didn't know him  so my mother didn't have a lot of money  she had to work  put herself through school  but with the help of scholarships and grants  she was able to get ahead  and then she was able to pass on a great education to me and my sister  and i'd think about how in america  unlike a lot of other countries  she could make something out of herself even in those circumstances  and then i'd meet a working couple  and i'd think about michelle's parents  her dad  by the time i met him  could barely walk  he had multiple sclerosis  so he had to use two canes  and he had to wake up an hour early  earlier than everybody else because that's how long it took him just to get dressed and get ready and get to the job  but he didn't miss a day of work  because he believed in his responsibilities and looking after his family  and michelle's mom worked as a secretary at a bank  and so they never had a lot of money  but they had a lot of love  and they understood the concept of hard work and responsibility  and so they were able to pass on an extraordinary life to michelle and her brother  and as i traveled around the state of illinois  it was clear to me that my story wasn't unique and the stories of people i was meeting weren't unique  it was the american story  it was this idea that here in this country  we don't believe in handouts  we don't believe in bailouts  we believe in people earning what they get  we believe in people working hard  we believe in people looking after their own families and taking responsibility and taking initiative  but we also believe that in this country  hard work should pay off  that responsibility should be rewarded  and we believe that in this country  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  you should be able to make it if you try  that has been the central notion that built this country  that has been our hallmark  that's been the core idea that drove america  this idea that in this country  you can get a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules  and so if you work hard  you can get ahead  and that's what created this economic superpower  and that's what created the greatest and largest middle class in the history of the world  now  in   when i was first running for president  we came together and a lot of you supported me in that race because we believed in those values and we believed in those ideas  and we had seen that  for almost a decade  that idea that had built america's middle class seemed as if it was slipping away  we had gone through a decade in which hard work wasn't always rewarded  middle class folks saw their incomes actually going down  so while their paychecks are shrinking  the cost of everything from health care to a college education kept on going up  a few people were doing really well  but the vast majority was struggling  meanwhile  in washington  we financed two wars on a credit card  turning a surplus into a deficit  and because nobody was making sure that folks on wall street were doing what they were supposed to be doing  all this culminated in the worst financial crisis and the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  we didn't know all that when i started to run  but what we understood was  what we were fighting for was the kind of change that would once again make real this idea that if you work hard you'll be rewarded and you can get ahead  we were fighting for policies that would grow the middle class and provide them with that sense of security  and by the way  it's not just a matter of how much money you have in your bank account when we talk about being middle class  it's the idea that if you work hard you can find a job that supports your family and you can maybe get a home you call your own and you're not going to go bankrupt if you get sick  you're going to be able to retire with dignity and respect  that and most importantly  that your kids and your grandkids can do even better than you did  that they can achieve what you didn't even imagine  for the last   years  everything i have done as president has been focused on that principle  and obviously  as we saw this economic crisis unfold  we understood that the change we believed in would take more than one year  more than one term  and probably take more than one president  but over the last   years  we've started to steer things in the right direction  we were losing   jobs a month when i was sworn in  now we've seen more than   years of job growth every single month  more than   million new jobs  an auto industry on the brink of collapse we made sure that we bet on american workers and american manufacturing  and it's come roaring back  we moved to make sure that college was more affordable for young people and that more americans had access to health care  and so over the last   years  everything we've done has been focused on how do we create an economy that is built to last  that's not built on speculation  that doesn't just benefit the few  but that consistently builds the middle class so that they can achieve their dreams  now  for all the work that we've done  we know we've got more work to do  because there are still millions of people out there out of work  too many people still have homes whose values have dropped because of this housing bubble bursting  so we understand that we've got more work to do  but sometimes  particularly during political season  when i hear cynics who say that our best days are behind us  i tell them  you don't know the american people  you don't know their grit  and you don't know their determination  you haven't met the small business owners who decided to keep everybody on payroll  even if they couldn't pay themselves  because they believed in doing the right thing  you haven't talked to some of these autoworkers in these plants that folks thought would never build another car again and now can't build them fast enough  you haven't met folks who  at the age of   or   went back to community college  sitting next to a bunch of  year olds  because they believed in retraining themselves and now are finding jobs in biotechnology or clean energy  when you travel around this country  you understand that the american people are tougher than any tough times  and although there are no quick fixes or easy solutions  there's no doubt that we can solve every challenge that we face  what's holding us back right now is not the lack of solutions  what's holding us back is a stalemate in washington  what's holding us back is a few folks who say  we are going to take the uncompromising view that the only path forward is to go back to what we were doing that got us into this mess in the first place  the same top down economics that we are now debating in this campaign  now  let me be specific here  this afternoon the senate passed a bill that says if you earn   a year or less  your taxes should not go up next year  this is something i deeply believe in  because the middle class is still struggling  recovering from this recession  you don't need your taxes to go up  and we could give you certainty right now  but  of course  we're dealing with washington  so republicans in the house  they've said  we're going to hold the middle class tax cut hostage unless they get another trillion dollars' worth of tax cuts for the wealthiest   percent of americans   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  i've got to tell you  this makes no sense  if congress doesn't act  the typical middle class family is going to see their tax bill go up about   small businesses will also see their taxes go up  so i've called on the house republicans to drop their demands for another trillion dollar giveaway for millionaires and billionaires so that we can make sure that middle class families and small businesses have the financial security and certainty that they need  but so far they don't see it that way  governor romney doesn't see it that way   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  because they've got a fundamentally different vision about how we move this country forward  they believe in top down economics  their plan is to cut more taxes for the wealthy  cut more regulations on banks and corporations  cut more investments in things like education  job training  science  research  all with the thought that somehow that's going to help us create jobs  that's what mitt romney believes  that's what washington republicans believe  i think they're wrong  that's not what i believe  that's not what you believe  that's not what most americans believe  we believe not in top down economics  we believe in middle class out economics  we believe in bottom up economics  that's what we're fighting for  that's what i have fought for for   years  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  so the good thing is you've got the power to break this stalemate  but you need to understand there are two fundamentally different visions about how we move forward  there's a real choice  i believe that hard work should be rewarded  and i believe that although all of us have to take individual initiative  there are also some things that we have to do together as a country to make sure that we grow  i don't believe that tax cuts for folks like me who don't need them and weren't even asking for them is going to grow the economy  but i do think that if we invest in outstanding education for every child in new orleans and every child across america  that will help grow the economy  so what i've said is let's help local school districts hire the best teachers  especially in math and science  let's help folks go to  million more people go to community colleges so that they can retrain for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  let's make sure building off the work we've already done to expand pell grants and to provide tuition tax credits for middle class families let's make sure that college tuition goes down instead of up  because in the  st century  a higher education is not a luxury  it's an economic necessity that everybody should have access to  that's one of the reasons i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  to make sure everybody gets a great education  here's another difference  i don't believe in giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i want to give tax breaks to companies that invest right here in new orleans  right here in louisiana  right here in the united states of america  hiring american workers to make american products to sell around the world  stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's a difference in this campaign  my opponent's got different ideas  he says he's qualified to turn around the economy because of all his private sector experience  turns out that experience is investing in companies that have been called  pioneers  of outsourcing  i don't believe in being a pioneer in outsourcing  i want some insourcing  i want to bring jobs back to the united states  not send them someplace else  that's a choice in this election  back in   i said i would end the war in iraq  and i did  thanks to the extraordinary service of our men and women in uniform  not only have we given iraqis an opportunity to determine their own destiny  but we were able to refocus our attention on al qaida  the folks who actually carried out the   attacks  so we've got them on their heels and decimated their leadership  including usama bin laden  and if and now in afghanistan we're starting to transition and bring our troops home so that afghans can take a lead for securing their own country  so after almost a decade of war  i think it's time to do some nation building here at home  i want to take half the money that we are saving and put people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and ports and new schools  that's good for the construction industry  it's good for the construction worker  but it also means that those folks have some money in their pockets and they can come down to new orleans and spend some of that money and help this local economy  and it lays the foundation for economic growth for decades to come  mr  romney has got different ideas  and we tried those ideas  and they didn't work  i believe that we did the right thing in providing health care to every american  i don't think you should go bankrupt because you got sick  i don't believe that children should not be able to get health insurance because of a preexisting condition  i think we did the right thing to make sure that young people could stay on their parent's plan until they're   i think we did the right thing to make sure that seniors have lower prescription drug costs  the supreme court has spoken  we are going to implement this law  we're not going backwards  we're going forward  that's a choice in this election  that's what we're fighting for  that's why i'm running for a second term as president  we're not going back to the day when you had to scramble and try to figure out how you were going to care for your loved ones if they got sick  we're not going to go back to the day when whether you could serve the country you loved depended on who you love  we ended  don't ask  don't tell  that was the right thing to do  we're not going back  we passed the lilly ledbetter act to make sure that women got equal pay for equal work  because i've got two daughters and think that they should be treated just like somebody else's sons  and we're not going to go back to the days when women did not have control of their health care choices  we are moving forward  we're not going backwards  on almost every issue there is a choice  and you see it in terms of how we deal with the deficit  i the deficit's a real problem  we got to reduce it  i inherited a big deficit  and we've got to now bring it down  but we can't bring it down just on the backs of the poor  we can't bring it down on the backs of the middle class  we can't bring it down in a way that prevents us from making investments in the future  so what i've said is  look  we've already cut a trillion dollars in programs that we don't need  and i'm willing to do a little bit more  but i'm not going to do more if we're not asking folks who have been most blessed by this country like me to just pay a little bit more in taxes  to go back to the rates that existed under bill clinton  and by the way  we've tried that  and that worked    million new jobs  surplus instead of deficits  and here's the thing  new orleans  here's the thing  we created a lot of millionaires then too  because what happens is when people in the middle and at the bottom have a chance and are doing well  then lo and behold  folks at the top got more customers  everybody does better  everybody benefits  we all grow  so those are the choices that we have in this election  and you're going to be the tiebreaker  you will break the stalemate  i've got to tell you  over the next   months you are going to hear a lot of stuff   i laughter i  that's what it is stuff   i laughter i  and sometimes they will play around with things i say  they'll take out whole sentences  they've got an ad right now where they just spliced it and diced it  make it seem like i don't appreciate the incredible work of small businesspeople  and i say  look  everything i've done over the last   years has been focused on how do we create greater opportunity for entrepreneurs and small businesspeople cutting their taxes   times  i understand the sacrifice and the sweat and the tears that they put in  but that's not going to be how it's presented because that's the nature of politics these days  we're going to see more money spent on negative ads than we've ever seen before  you've got folks writing   million checks  and the message in all these ads is going to be the same  there will be variations on it  but it's all going to be the same message  which basically is  the economy is still struggling  and it's obama's fault  it's a very succinct message  and the reason that that's their message is because they know that their actual ideas won't sell  that their approach is not one that's going to work and the american people have rejected in the past  so all they can do is try to argue that just by getting rid of me  somehow everything is going to be solved  and look  when folks who are writing   million checks are going after you  you think about it   i laughter i  no  you think about it  but here's the thing  the reason i stand before you feeling good and feeling confident about america's future  not just about this election  is because i've been the underdog before  i've been counted out before  i've been outspent before  but what i learned in those very first campaigns  and has been confirmed for me ever since  is that when the american people really started focusing and paying attention  when they started cutting through the nonsense  when they start listening to what folks actually have to say  and when the american people start reflecting on their own lives  they think about their parents and their grandparents and their great grandparents and the story of how some of them maybe came to this country as immigrants  some came in chains  but all of those forebearers of ours understood there was something about this country where we could make it  it might be hard sometimes  there might be times where we have setbacks  but if we applied ourselves  we could pass on a better america to the next generation  that idea that idea that led me into politics  that idea that is true for all of our families when we focus on that idea  when we remember that we rise or fall together as one nation and as one people  when that idea comes to the fore  the american people can't be stopped  it doesn't matter how many negative ads are out there  it doesn't matter how much money is spent  change happens when the american people are focusing on those things that are best in us  and so over these next   months  i will be carrying your stories with me  and it will give me confidence  and it will give me inspiration  just like it did in   and i have to tell you  new orleans  back in   i tried to not make promises that i couldn't keep  so i promised to end the war in iraq  i kept that promise  i said i'd cut taxes for middle class families  average families  taxes are   lower than when i came into office  kept that promise  one of the other promises i kept was i said  you know i'm not a perfect man michelle will tell you that i laughter i and i won't be a perfect president  but what i can promise is that i'll always tell you what i think and i'll always tell you where i stand and  most importantly  i will wake up every morning and fight as hard as i know how for you  because i see myself in you  in your grandparents  i see my grandparents  in your children  i see malia and sasha  i see my own story in your story  and so i've kept that promise  new orleans  i've been fighting for you  i believe in you  and if you still believe in me and you're willing to stand with me and fight with me and organize with me and make phone calls with me and knock on doors with me  if you see what i see a bold  generous  optimistic america where all people have a fair shot at success and everybody is doing their fair share i promise you  we will finish what we started and we will remind the world just why it is that the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  ohio  well  it is good to be in mansfield  i hope everybody is having a great summer  a couple of people i want to acknowledge  first of all  please give a huge round of applause to brenda for that great introduction  and go try some of her pizza if you have not tried it  what i hear   i audience member i   i inaudible i   i the president i  you got a testimony right here  he says it's outstanding  i want to thank her so much for doing this  a couple other people  your outstanding former governor  ted strickland  is here  give ted a big round of applause  and although he couldn't be here because he's got votes  i just want to tell you that you could not have a stronger advocate than your hometown boy  the united states senator from ohio  sherrod brown   i audience member i  we love you  mr  president   i the president i  i love you back  and i want to thank all the neighborhood team leaders who are here who are working so hard in this campaign  now  finally  i just think it makes sense for us to give it up for all of our outstanding american athletes who are competing in london right now  i want to congratulate michael phelps  most medals we've ever seen  and then i had a chance on the way over here to call up the women's gymnastic team for bringing home the gold  i have to tell you  when i'm watching when people run track  i understand  i know how to run  they're just much faster   i laughter i  and i know how to swim they just swim much better than i do  these gymnastics folks i don't understand how they do what they do   i laughter i  so i told these young ladies as i was congratulating them  how do you not bust your head i laughter i every time you're on those that little balance beam  i couldn't walk across that balance beam   i laughter i  so anyway  we could not be prouder of them  and there are a whole bunch of ohioans who are representing our country in the olympics and the paralympics  abby johnston from upper arlington already won a silver medal in diving  we'll be rooting for army specialist justin lester from akron  he's going to be wrestling for america next week  so the wonderful thing about the olympics is it reminds us that  for all our differences  when it comes down to our country  we're americans first  and we could not be prouder of them and everything they're doing on our behalf  now  unless you've been hiding from your television  you may be aware  there's a pretty intense campaign going on right now  and the reason that this is an intense campaign is because the choice that we faced in november could not be bigger  i mean  this is a stark choice  it's a choice not just between two candidates or two parties  but more than any election in recent memory  this is a choice between two fundamentally different visions for america two fundamentally different paths that we should that we could be going down   i audience member   i love you  obama   i the president i  i appreciate that   i laughter i  now  the direction that we choose the direction you choose when you walk into this voting booth in november is going to have a direct impact on your lives  but also on your children's lives and your grandchildren's lives  and   years ago  we came together as democrats  but also independents and some republicans to restore the basic bargain that built the greatest middle class and the most prosperous country the world has ever known  and it's a bargain that i've lived in my life and so many of you have experienced  it's the basic idea that says here in this country  if you work hard  that work should be rewarded  if you act responsibly  you should be able to get ahead  it's a deal that says if we put in enough effort  we should be able to find a job that pays the bills  we should be able to afford a home that we call our own  we should have health care that we can count on if we get sick  we should be able to retire with dignity and respect  and most of all  we should be able to give our children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger and do even better than we ever imagined  that's what we believe  it's a simple american promise  it's at the a core of the american dream  and we knew that restoring it wouldn't be easy  we knew it would take more than one year or one term or even one president  and that was before the middle class was hammered by the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  a crisis that robbed too many of our friends and our neighbors of their homes  their jobs  their savings and pushed the american dream even further out of reach for too many people  but you know what  there's one thing that that crisis did not changed  it did not change who we are  it did not change the american character  it did not change what made us great  it hasn't changed why we came together to do what we did in   it's just made our mission more urgent  our first order of business is to recover all the jobs and wealth that was lost in the crisis  and we've made strides these last   years to get that done  but beyond that  we're here to reclaim that financial security that's been slipping away for more than a decade  the decade before i came into office  your incomes and wages generally weren't going up  jobs were moving overseas  the auto industry had been getting hammered  so our job is not just to put people back to work  it's also to build an economy where  over the long haul  that work pays off  so that no matter who you are  or what you look like  or where you come from  here in america  you can make it if you try  that's what this campaign is about  ohio  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  mansfield  there are no quick fixes or easy solutions to the challenges we face  but there's no doubt in my mind  we've got the capacity to meet them  think about everything that we have going for us here in america  we've got the best workers  we've got the best entrepreneurs  we've got the best scientists  we've got the best researchers  we've got the best colleges  best universities  we've got a buckeye guy right here  we're a young nation  with great diversity of talent and ingenuity  people come here want to come here from every corner of the globe  so no matter what the naysayers tell us  no matter how dark the other side tries to make things look  there is not another country on earth that wouldn't gladly trade places with the united states of america  so what's standing in our way is not that we don't have the ingredients to make the  st century the american century just like the  th  the problem we've got right now is our politics  the sort of uncompromising view  the notion that we should be going back to what we were doing that got us into this mess in the first place  instead of going forward to achieve a brighter american future  it's the old it's that old top down economics that we've been hearing about for years  the old  discredited idea that if we somehow get rid of more regulations on big corporations and give more tax breaks to the wealthiest americans  that somehow that's going to lead to more jobs and prosperity for everybody  ohio  you know better  i know better  we know this country wasn't built from the top down  it was built by the middle class  it was built by farmers and factory workers and startups and small businesses and companies that sent american products overseas  not sending american jobs overseas  that's what built ohio  and that's what built america  and that's what we're fighting for  that's what we're fighting for right now  that's the economy we need to build together  and i promise you  we will not get there if we adopt these ideas that somehow spending more money on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires who don't need them and aren't even asking for them is actually going to improve the economy  we tried that  it did not work  now  despite the evidence  the entire centerpiece of my opponent's economic plan is a new    trillion tax cut on top of the bush tax cuts   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  the bulk of this tax cut would go to the very top  a lot of it would go to the wealthiest   percent of all households  folks making more than   million a year the top one tenth of one percent would get a tax cut worth almost a quarter of a million dollars  now  think about that  folks making   million a year or more would get a quarter of a million dollar tax cut  but listen  it gets worse   i laughter i  under my opponent's plan  who do you think gets the bill for these   tax cuts  you do  and you do not have to take my word for it  just today an independent  nonpartisan organization ran all the numbers on governor romney's plan  this wasn't my staff  this wasn't something we did  independent group ran the numbers  they found that if governor romney wants to keep his word and pay for this plan  then he'd have to cut tax breaks that middle class families depend on to pay for your home the home mortgage deduction to pay for your health care the health care deduction to send your kids to college  that means the average middle class family with children  according to this study  would be hit with a tax increase of more than    i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and here's the thing  he's not asking you to contribute more to pay down the deficit  he's not asking you to pay more to invest in our children's education or rebuild our roads or put more folks back to work  he's asking you to pay more so that people like him can get a big tax cut  in order to afford just one   tax cut for somebody like mr  romney    families like yours would have to pay another   in taxes each and every year  does that sound like a good plan for economic growth   i audience members i  no   i the president i  does that sound like a plan you can afford   i audience members i  no   i the president i  how many of you want to pay another   to give mr  romney or me another tax break   i audience members i  no   i the president i  ohio  we do not need more tax cuts for folks who are already doing really well  we need tax cuts for working americans  we need tax cuts for families who are trying to raise their children and keep them healthy and send them to college and put a roof over their heads  we don't need more tax cuts for companies that are shipping jobs overseas  we need tax cuts for companies that are creating jobs right here in the united states of america  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  mansfield  i've got a different plan for america than mr  romney's  four years ago  i promised to cut middle class taxes  and that's exactly what i've done  by a total of about   for the typical family  now i want to keep income taxes exactly where they are on the first   of everybody's income  so if your family makes under   a year which is   percent of american families you won't see your income taxes increase by a single dime next year  now  if you're fortunate enough to be in the other   percent of americans  all we're asking you to do is contribute a little bit more this includes me  by the way so that we can pay down our deficit and invest in things like education that are going to help us grow over the long term  and in terms of cutting our deficit  i'll make sure government does its part  we're going to cut away spending that we don't need  we've already cut a trillion dollars  we can do more  but i'm not going to pay for massive new tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires by gutting the investments that have always kept the middle class strong  all we're asking people like me and mr  romney to do is go back to the rates we paid under bill clinton  and i don't know if you remember  that's when our economy created nearly   million new jobs  the biggest budget surplus in history  and here's the kicker  it actually created a lot of millionaires  because when the middle class is doing well  then our businesses do well  when folks have money to spend  they buy a new car  and the car companies do well  and they hire more workers  when you've got some extra money in your pockets  then you go get some pizza from brenda  and then brenda decides  maybe she can afford to hire another worker  that's how we grow our economy if we're investing in roads and bridges  putting some hardhats back to work  getting our steelworkers back to work  they've got more money to spend  maybe they buy that new computer  maybe they decide to take a little vacation  and all that money circulates in the economy  and it makes us all grow  so here's the bottom line  ohio  if you believe that their plan mr  romney's plan and his congressional allies if you genuinely believe that that plan will make you better off  if you believe it's okay for them to tell us just to set our sights lower or to settle for something less  then by all means  send these folks back to washington for the next few years   i audience members i  no   i the president i  but wouldn't you be better off  wouldn't we all be better off if we kept fighting for the things that have always made us strong   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  if we fought to make higher education more affordable so more young people can go to college  wouldn't we be better off if we invested to develop new sources of american energy  wouldn't we be better off if we kept investing in manufacturing so that we can sell goods around the world stamped with the words  made in mansfield  ohio made in the united states of america  in   years or   years or   years  won't we be better off if we've got the courage to keep moving forward  to keep working our way back  that's what i believe  that's why i'm running for president  you know  my hair may be grayer than it was   years ago   i laughter i  but my determination to do right by you is stronger than ever  my faith in you is stronger than ever  and if you still believe in me like i believe in you  i hope you'll stand with me in november  i'm asking you to stand with me in november  i'm asking you to join this cause  let's finish what we started in   let's put the middle class back in the forefront  let's remind the world just why it is that the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  how's it going  leesburg  well  it is good to be back in virginia  a couple of people i want to acknowledge  first of all  please give dana a big round of applause  you can tell she's a good teacher  and we're so proud of her  and i also want to acknowledge  mayor kristen umstattd is here  and thank you to all the neighborhood team leaders who are here  thank you for your great work  the other thing i want to do is just to acknowledge our unbelievable u s  athletes who are representing us in london  including virginia's own gabby douglas   i audience members i  u s a  u s a  u s a   i the president i  u s a  i had a chance to talk to gabby and her teammates after they won the team competition  and i told them  you know  i'm impressed with the swimmers  and when the running comes  i'm going to be impressed with that  but even though i'm a lot slower  i understand how you run and how you swim  i do not understand how  on this little balance beam  you're flipping around  i don't get that   i laughter i  i can barely do a somersault   i laughter i  unbelievable  so we could not be prouder of gabby  we could not be prouder of her teammates  and we could not be prouder of all our american athletes  and you know  it's a useful reminder that even when we have these major debates back home  when we go overseas  we're not democrats  and we're not republicans or independents  we are americans  that's what we're about  now  unless you've been able to hide your television set or your cable is busted  you may know that there is a pretty intense campaign going on right now   i laughter i  and the reason that it's so intense is because so much is at stake  the choice that we face in november could not be bigger  it's not just a choice between two candidates  it's not just a choice between two parties  more than any election in recent memory  this is a choice between two fundamentally different paths for our country  two fundamentally different visions of where we need to go  and the direction that we choose the direction that all of you will choose when you walk into that voting booth in november is going to have a direct impact not just on your lives  it will have an impact on your children's lives and your grandchildren's lives  it will affect us for decades to come  now    years ago  we came together not just as democrats  but also independents  republicans we came together because we wanted to restore a basic bargain that made us the country that we are  the core idea that made us the most prosperous economy in the history of the world  and it's a simple idea  it's a bargain that says if you work hard  that work should be rewarded  it's a deal that says if you put in enough effort and you act responsibly  then you can find a job that pays the bills and you can afford a home that you call your own  that you can count on health care if you get sick and you can put away enough money to retire with dignity and respect  and most of all  it's an idea that we can give our children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger dreams and do even better than we did  that's at the heart of who we are  that's the american promise  and let's face it  part of the reason why we had so much energy in the   campaign was because we understood that we had seen a decade where that basic bargain wasn't being met  families were working harder and harder  but their incomes were actually stagnating  while the costs of everything from health care to college were going up  we went from a surplus to a record deficit because of tax cuts we didn't pay for and because of two wars that we put on a credit card  and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  so we understood that restoring that basic american idea  that if you work hard  you can get ahead that is at the heart of the middle class  the heart of who we are  we knew restoring that was not going to be easy and it would take more than one year and it would take more than one term and it would probably take more than one president  and that was before the middle class was hammered by this crisis that robbed too many of our friends and neighbors of their jobs and their homes and their savings and pushed the american dream even further out of reach for too many working families  but you know what  over the last   years  we've shown we can make progress  over the last   years  we've been able to create   million jobs and half a million jobs in manufacturing  and we've saved an auto industry  the economy is growing  and we know we've got more work to do  but it's given us a sense of what it means to move forward and not back  and what's also given us confidence is there's one thing that this crisis has not changed  it hasn't changed who we are  it hasn't changed our character  it hasn't changed what made us great  it hasn't changed why we came together to do what we did in   it just made our mission more urgent  we are here to build an economy where hard work pays off  where responsibility is rewarded so that no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you came from  no matter what your last name is  here in america  you can make it if you try  that's what this campaign is about   i applause i  that's what this campaign is about  leesburg  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  like i said  we've still got a lot of work to do   i audience member i  we love you  obama   i the president i  i love you back  but we've still got a lot of work to do  we've still got millions of people out there who are looking for work  too many homes are still underwater  and we recognize there are no quick fixes or easy solutions to all the problems we face  but there is no doubt in my mind that we've got the capacity to meet these challenges  think about what we've got going for us  we've got the best workers in the world  we've got the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best scientists and researchers in the world  we've got the best colleges and the best universities in the world  we're a young nation  with the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity  loudoun county is a great example of it  people coming here from every corner of the globe looking for opportunity  so no matter what the naysayers say  no matter how dark the other side tries to paint the situation  there is not a country on earth that would not gladly trade places with the united states of america  so what's standing in our way is not the lack of technical solutions  it's not the lack of ideas that will help move us forward  what's holding us back right now is politics in washington  it's a stalemate  it's a stalemate that results from the uncompromising view of   i audience member i   i inaudible i   i the president   i that's i i this idea that the only thing we can do is go back to the same top down economics that didn't work and got us into this mess in the first place   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i mean  their look  mr  romney and his allies in congress  they've got a very simple set of ideas when it comes to the economy  their basic theory is if they cut taxes more for the wealthy  and if they get rid of regulations some of which have been on the books for decades  some of which we put in place to rein in wall street after this latest debacle  some of which we put in to make sure that health insurance companies aren't taking advantage of you  some of which we put in place to make sure that credit card companies or financial institutions are treating consumers fairly the notion is that somehow if we get rid of those regulations and we give more tax breaks to the wealthiest americans  this will all lead to jobs and prosperity for everybody   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  look  that is their idea  that is what they are proposing  that's where they will take us if they win  the centerpiece of governor romney's entire economic plan is a new    trillion tax cut  this is on top of the bush tax cuts  now  we've known for a while that a lot of this tax cut would go to the wealthiest   percent of all households  we knew that  but yesterday an independent  nonpartisan organization  they dug into the numbers  they did the research  they analyzed governor romney's plan  and by the way  this is an organization that's headed by an economist who used to work for president bush  so this is not some partisan analysis  this is a bipartisan  independent analysis  so here's what they found  i want everybody to pay attention  this study found that folks making more than   million a year so this is the top one tenth of   percent would get a tax cut worth almost a quarter of a million dollars   i audience members i  no   i the president i  so they'd get a   tax break at least  some folks would get more  so the question is since governor romney says he doesn't want to add to the deficit  he thinks this is a moral challenge  we've got to bring down the deficit who gets the bill for these   tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires   i audience members i  we do   i the president i  this is a smart crowd   i laughter i  you do  this analysis found that if governor romney wants to keep his promise and pay for his plan so that it doesn't increase the deficit even more  then a middle class family with children will be hit with an average tax increase of more than    i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  understand  he's not asking you to pay an extra   to reduce the deficit or to invest in schools or to help pay for the war or to help look after our veterans  that's not why he's asking you to pay an extra   he's asking you to pay more so that folks like him can pay less   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  just to give you some sense of this and again  this is not my analysis in order to afford just one   tax cut for somebody like mr  romney    of families like yours would have to pay another   in taxes each and every year   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  not surprisingly  his campaign was asked about this romney middle class tax hike  and they said the study failed to take into account the massive economic boom that would come from cutting taxes on the wealthiest americans in the biggest corporations  we saw how well that worked the last time we tried it  we know better than this  they have been trying to sell us this trickle down  tax cut fairy dust before  we've seen this before  and guess what  every single time  it doesn't work  it didn't work then  it won't work now  it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to lower our deficit  it's not a plan to move our economy forward  we do not need more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  we need tax cuts for working americans  we need to keep taxes fair and low for families who are trying to raise their children and keep them healthy and send those kids to college and keep a roof over their heads  if we're going to make sacrifices  we should be making it to invest in schools and bring down our deficit  we don't need more tax cuts for companies especially those that are shipping jobs overseas we need tax cuts for companies that are creating jobs right here in the united states of america  right here in virginia  and that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  so i've got virginia  i've got a different plan for america  four years ago  i promised to cut middle class taxes  and i kept that promise  by a total of about   for the typical family  so now i want to keep taxes exactly where they are on the first   of everybody's income  so if your family makes under  like   percent of americans do you won't see your income taxes increase by a single dime next year  now  if you're fortunate enough to be in the other   percent of americans i fall in that category  some of you do too all we're asking is that we can contribute a little bit more so that we can pay down this deficit and invest in things like education that will help us grow  and keep in mind look  we're going to make sure government does its part  because there's still waste in government  we've already made a trillion dollars worth of cuts  we can do more streamlining  we can make government more efficient and more consumer friendly  but i'm not going to pay for a massive new tax cut for millionaires and billionaires by gutting investments like education and infrastructure and basic science and research and the safety net and medicare  those things that have always kept the middle class strong  all i'm asking is that we go back for folks like me  for the top   percent go back to the rates we paid under bill clinton  and by the way  if you remember  that was when our economy created nearly   million new jobs  the biggest budget surplus in history  and a whole lot of millionaires to boot  that's how we grow the economy  look  nobody is satisfied with our pace of growth  nobody is satisfied  even with all the jobs we're created  we've got to create more  but if you look at our history  if you look at the facts  every time we've grown  it hasn't been by the top down  it's been from the middle out  it's been from the bottom up  when middle class families are doing well  lo and behold  everybody does well  if that construction worker has got a little extra money in his pocket  he goes and spends it  maybe on a new car  when we've got new teachers doing great work with our kids  then  you know what  they go to a restaurant and spend that money  and so suddenly  businesses are doing well  the economy is doing well  and we get into a virtuous cycle  and we go up  but if everybody is struggling and all we're doing is rewarding folks who are already doing so well that they can't really spend any more  the economy doesn't grow as fast  so  leesburg  if you believe that governor romney's plan will make us better off   i audience members i  no   i the president   i if you genuinely think that we're going to grow our economy faster by cutting education spending  cutting transportation spending  slashing our investments in things like basic science and research  voucherizing medicare and adding to our deficit  plus asking each of you to pay an extra   so that folks at the top can get another big tax break  then that's your plan  he's got it   i audience members i  no   i the president i  and they will do exactly what they promise  but you know what it means is  is that that vision to me means we're setting our sights lower  it means we're settling for something less  it means that we no longer are embracing the basic tenet that helped make this country great  and that is that everybody can make it and everybody does their fair share  everybody gets a fair shot  everybody is playing by the same set of rules  i mean  don't you think we would be better off if we keep fighting for the things that always made us strong  if we're helping families send their kids to college and they're not loaded up with a whole bunch of debt  aren't we going to be better off if we're developing new sources of american energy  aren't we going to be better off if we invest in advanced manufacturing  and we're bringing jobs back here  we're doing insourcing instead of outsourcing  and we're selling goods to the rest of the world stamped with those proud words  made in virginia  made in the united states of america  made by american hands  when we look back   years or   years or   years from now  aren't we going to be better off if we have the courage to keep moving forward  that's what is at stake in this election  and that's what i believe  my hair may be grayer than it was   yeas ago   i laughter i  i've got a birthday coming up  i'm going to be   but michelle says i don't look a day over   but even though i'm a little older and a little grayer  my determination to do right by you  to fight for you  to think about you  to see myself in you  to wake up every single day  fighting as hard as i know how on behalf of america's middle class and folks who are aspiring to get in the middle class  that determination is undiminished  my faith in you is stronger than ever  and if you still believe in me like i believe in you  i'm asking you to stand with me  you got to make some phone calls with me  knock on some doors for me  recruit your friends and your neighbors with me  we won loudoun county last time  and if we win loudoun county this time  we will win virginia  and if we win virginia  we will win this election  and we will finish what we started in   and remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  leesburg  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  orlando  thank you   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  the first of all  anybody who's got a seat  feel free to use the seat  go ahead  sit down  you guys  make yourselves comfortable  those of you who don't have a seat  make sure to bend your knees i laughter i  because   i audience member i  we love you  obama   i the president i  i love you back  it's great to see you  it's great to be back in orlando  first of all  can everybody please give sonia a big round of applause for that great introduction  i want to thank darren soto  state representative  for our preprogram  and i want to thank all the neighborhood team leaders for the great job you guys are doing   i audience members i  happy birthday   i the president i  now thank you  it's true that i'm going to be what am i going to be   i laughter i   i audience members i  fifty one   i the president i  i'm going to be   on saturday  but michelle says i look    i laughter i  so that's not bad   i at this point  members of the audience sang  happy birthday i   i the president i  thank you  now  if i had known you guys were going to sing  we would have had a cake   i laughter i  and then i would have blown out the candle  i would have made a wish i laughter i that probably would have had to do with electoral votes   i laughter i  winning florida wouldn't be a bad birthday present  now but before we talk about politics  let me say  how about our olympic athletes in london   i audience members i  u s a  u s a  u s a   i the president i  u s a  i yesterday i had a chance to talk to michael phelps  and then i spoke to the fab five  these gymnasts  and let me just say i was saying this to some folks in ohio yesterday i understand how to swim and how to run  although i don't swim and run like these folks do   i laughter i  but this whole gymnastics thing  i don't get that   i laughter i  i don't understand how you're standing on a little beam and then you flip around a bunch of times without breaking your neck   i laughter i  it's unbelievable  it's unbelievable  so the we could not be more proud of them  and obviously  it's a reminder that even when we've got our differences  we come together when it's about presenting ourselves to the rest of the world  that we are americans first  and we are so grateful for them and the classy way that they're representing us  now  unless you've been able to hide your television set somewhere or your cable is broke i laughter i you are aware that there's a pretty intense campaign going on right now   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  and the reason for that is because the choice that we face this november could not be bigger  could not be more significant  in some ways  it's more important than   this is not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties  this is a choice about two fundamentally different visions for america  two fundamentally different paths for our future  and here's the good news  you choose the direction  you are the tie breaker  you will decide the direction that we go in not just when you walk into that voting booth  it won't just be for next year or the year after that  you'll be making decisions that will have an impact on our kids and our grandkids for years to come  for decades to come  now    years ago  we came together as democrats  but also independents and some republicans to restore that basic bargain that built this country  what made us an economic superpower  what made us the most prosperous economy that the world has ever known  and it is a simple bargain  it's a simple deal  a simple credo  it says that if you work hard  your work should be rewarded  it's a deal that says  if you put in enough effort  you should be able to find a job that pays the bills  you should be able to afford a job you should be able to afford a home that you call your own  you should be able to count on health care if you get sick and retire with dignity and respect  and most of all  you should be able to give your kids an education that allows them to dream even bigger than you did and do even better than you ever imagined  it's a simple idea  it's the basic american promise  and we knew that restoring it wasn't going to be easy  we knew it would take more than one year or one term or even one president  after all  we had gone through a decade of sluggish job growth and jobs being shipped overseas and going from surpluses to deficits  all culminating in a financial crisis on wall street  so we understood it was going to take some time to deal with challenges that didn't happen overnight  and that was even before the middle class was hammered by the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  a crisis that robbed too many of our friends and neighbors of jobs and their homes and their savings and pushed the american dream even further out of reach for too many working families  but you know what  over the last   years  i have taken strength from you  the american people  because i've seen your resilience  i've seen folks get knocked down and get right back up  you are tougher than tough times  and that is the reason why we've been able to see   million jobs created  that's why we've been able to see the housing market just barely  slowly start to tick back up  that's the reason that we've seen the auto industry come all the way back  it's because of you  see  there's one thing that the crisis did not change  it did not change who we are  it has not changed our fundamental character  it hasn't changed what made us great  it hasn't changed how we came together in   it's only made us more determined to make sure that america is doing right by everyone  that our prosperity is broadly based and broadly shared  and we're here to build an economy in which work pays off  so that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from  what your last name is  here in america  you can make it if you try  that's what we're fighting for  that's what this campaign is about  florida  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  there are no quick fixes or easy solutions to our challenges  but let me say this  we know what we need to do  there are no challenges that are not within our power to solve  we've got the capacity to meet any challenge  we have the best workers in the world  we've got the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best scientists  the best researchers  the best colleges  the best universities  we're a young nation we're still a young nation  and we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity that comes from every corner of the globe  nobody knows that better than florida  so no matter what the naysayers tell us  no matter how dark the other side tries to paint the situation  there is not another country on earth that would not gladly trade places with the united states of america  so i want you all to understand  we can solve our problems  and we've made significant strides on a whole range of areas  but what's standing in our way still is our politics  what's standing in our way is a group of folks in washington with some uncompromising views  folks who believe that the only way we can get back on track is to go back to the same top down economics that got us into this mess in the first place   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  what do i mean by top down economics  their basic theory mr  romney  his friends in congress  they basically believe that if we just give more tax cuts  on top of the bush tax cuts  to the wealthiest americans and we get rid of regulations that we've placed on wall street banks  for example  to make sure we don't have another crisis  or on the health care industry to make sure that they don't discriminate against you because you've got a preexisting condition  or the idea is that somehow  if we cut taxes for folks at the top and get rid of regulations  this will lead to more jobs and more prosperity to everybody  that's their theory  that's the path that they're proposing  it's not that complicated  that's where they will take us if they win  i guarantee you  the centerpiece of mr  romney's economic plan is a new   trillion tax cut  that's the heart of his economic plan  now  we know that this tax cut would probably be going to the wealthiest   percent of all households  we knew that  but yesterday an independent  nonpartisan organization  they dug into the numbers  they investigated  what would it mean to give this romney plan a try  and this by the way  this is an organization that's headed by an economist who worked for president bush  all right  so this was not my opinion  this was not our team's opinion  this is something that was looked at by a nonpartisan group  here's what they found  they found that folks making more than   million a year  the top one tenth of   percent  would get a tax cut under mr  romney's plan of almost a quarter of a million dollars   i audience members i  boo   i the president   i two hundred and fifty thousand dollars would go to folks who are making   million a year or more  that's the average  that's the typical  now  mr  romney claims that he's going to get this tax cut and he's going to bring down the deficit  so then the question is  who do you think gets the bill for these   tax cuts   i audience members i  we do   i the president i  this is a smart crowd   i laughter i  you do  this analysis also found that if governor romney wants to keep his word and pay for his plan so that he does not increase the deficit even more  the average middle class family with children would be stuck with a tax increase of more than    i audience members i  boo   i the president i  so i want everybody to understand here  he's not asking you to pay an extra   to reduce our deficit  he's not asking you to pay an additional   to help care for our seniors  he's not asking to pay an additional   in order to rebuild america or to fight a war  he's asking you to pay more so that people like him can pay less   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  so that people like me pay less  look  in order to afford one   tax cut for somebody like mr  romney  a hundred and twenty five families like many of yours would have to pay an additional   in taxes  and that's not a one time thing  this would be each and every year   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  i just want you to know this study was released yesterday  so his campaign was asked about it   well  what do you think  so well  first they said  well  this is a liberal organization  despite the fact that it's headed by an economist who worked for george bush  then they said that the study failed to fully take into account the massive economic boom that would come from cutting taxes on the wealthiest americans and the biggest corporations  because we all know how well that worked out the last time we tried it  look  orlando  we know better  they have tried to sell us this trickle down tax cut fairy dust before   i laughter i  and guess what  it didn't work then  it will not work now  it's not a plan to create jobs  it is not a plan to reduce the deficit  it is not a plan to build our middle class  it is not a plan to move our economy forward  it takes us backwards to a place we don't need to be  we do not need more tax cuts for folks who have done very  very well  we need more tax cuts for working americans  we need tax cuts for families who are trying to raise your children and keep your children healthy and send them to college and put roofs over their heads  we don't need more tax cuts for companies that are shipping jobs overseas  we need tax cuts for companies that are investing here in florida and here in the united states of america  hiring american workers  sending products around the world stamped with those proud words  made in america  that's what we're fighting for  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running again for president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  so listen  when it comes to taxes and reducing the deficit  i've got a different plan for america  four years ago  i promised to cut middle class taxes  that's exactly what i did  by a total of about   for the typical family  now i want to keep income taxes exactly where they are on the first   of everybody's income tax  so if you're a family that makes under   a year  like   percent of american families do  you won't see your income taxes increase by a single dime next year  on the other hand  if you're fortunate enough to be in the other   percent of americans  like i am  all we're asking is that we contribute a little bit more so that we can pay down our debt and so that we can still invest things in things like education and infrastructure and basic science and advanced manufacturing  all those things that help us grow as an economy  and look  i'm going to make sure government does its part  we're going to have to cut away spending that we don't need  we've made enormous progress in making government more efficient and streamlining it  but we can do more  we've cut a trillion dollars already  we can do more  but i'm not going to pay for a massive new tax cut for folks who don't need it by gutting the investments that have always kept us at the forefront and have kept our middle class strong  and by the way  florida  just like we tried their way  what i'm talking about we've tried too  all i'm asking is that we go back to the rates that were paid by wealthy individuals under bill clinton  and if you remember  that's when our economy created nearly   million new jobs  we created the biggest budget surplus in history  and here's the kicker  it was good for everybody  people at the top  they did well  because if a construction worker has a job and he's got some money in his pocket  then he might go out and buy that new appliance  and if that small business just opened a restaurant and now everybody in the community has a little extra money to spend  that restaurant will do better  and if you've got a job and you're feeling pretty good  got some money in your pocket  you might decide to get rid of that old beater and buy a new car  so and then  those businesses hire more people  and you get what's called a virtuous cycle  so  florida  if you believe their plan will make us better   i audience members i  no   i the president   i if you believe that it's okay to pay for a big tax cut for folks who don't need it   i audience members i  no   i the president   i and asking you to pay for it  and cutting our investments in education and voucherizing medicare and making a whole other range of changes that will impose greater hardship on the middle class if you think we should set our sights lower like that  settle for something less then go ahead and send these folks to washington  now   i audience members i  no   i the president i  obviously  that was a rhetorical question   i laughter i  but let me ask you this  wouldn't we be better off if we keep fighting for the things that have always made us strong  making sure our young people can afford to get a higher education  wouldn't we be better off if we're developing new sources of american energy because we've put the money into the research to develop them  wouldn't we be better off if we were investing in things like advanced manufacturing to sell goods around the rest of the world made right here in florida with american workers  five years or   years or   years from now  won't we be better off if we've made these smart sometimes tough decisions  understanding that we grow this economy not from the top down  but from the middle out and from the bottom up  creating an economy where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules  won't we be better off if we've got the courage to keep working and fighting and moving forward  that's what i believe  that's why i'm running for president  you know  my listen  florida  orlando  i want you to know my hair may be grayer than it was   years ago i laughter i i may be turning   but my determination to do right by you  to fight for you  to think about you every single day  that determination is stronger than ever  my faith in you is stronger than ever  i still believe in you  and if you still believe in me  if you're willing to stand with me  if you're willing to organize with me  if you're willing to make some phone calls for me  if you're willing to register some voters for me  if you're going out there and voting with me  i promise you  we will finish what we started and we will remind the world just why it is that the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  everybody  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  colorado  it is good to be back in grand junction  love grand junction  it was about   years ago  around this time  that i was first in grand junction  we had a bunch of bales of hay   i laughter i  you remember that  everybody was nice  weather was a little warm   i laughter i  and it is great to be back  i've got a couple of people i want to acknowledge  first of all  please give deanne a big round of applause for the great introduction  and i'm a little sweet on deanne  not just because of a great introduction  but also because she's a nurse  and i just love nurses because they do such a great job every day  also  we've got one of your outstanding u s  senators  michael bennet  in the house  there he is  and one of your former senators  who is now doing an outstanding job looking after the natural resources of this great country of ours  secretary of the interior ken salazar  now  those of you who have a seat  feel free to take a seat   i laughter i  those of you who don't  just remember to bend your knees because i laughter i sometimes i have people drop off in the middle of i laughter i even when i'm not talking too long  just because they've been standing too long  so especially when it's warm like this   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  who was that  i do  now  obviously  this is a smart crowd  and so i know that most of the last couple of weeks  you've been watching the olympics  cheering on our u s  athletes over in london  you've been spending time with family and trying to get outdoors  at least when it cools off  but unless you've been able to hide the television completely or your cable is broke  then you may be aware there's a pretty intense campaign going on right now  and the reason it's such an intense campaign is because the choice that we face in november could not be bigger  this is not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties  it's a choice about two fundamentally different visions for the country  two fundamentally different paths  and the direction that we choose the direction that you choose when you walk into that voting booth in less than   months is going to have a direct impact not just on our lives  but on the lives of our children and our grandchildren for decades to come  now    years ago  we came together democrats  but also independents and some republicans to restore the basic bargain that had built this country  that had made us the most prosperous nation on earth  and it's a very simple bargain  it says  if you work hard  your work will be rewarded  it says that if you put in enough effort  you can find a job that pays a decent wage  pays the bills  that you can afford to have a home that you call your own  that you have health care you can count on when you get sick  that after a lifetime of labor  you can put away enough to retire with dignity and respect  and most importantly  that you can give your kids the kind of education and opportunity that allows them to dream even bigger and do even better than you could ever imagine  that's the promise of america   i applause i  that's the promise of america  now  when we came together  we knew restoring that bargain that deal  that compact was not going to be easy  we knew it would take more than one year or one term or maybe even one president  because   i audience member i  four more years   i the president   i because we had seen what had happened in the previous decade  jobs had moved overseas  folks were working harder and harder  but their wages or incomes  they were staying flat  sometimes even going down  the cost of everything from health care to college was going up  and then  it all culminated in the worst economic crisis since the great depression  a crisis that robbed too many of our friends and our neighbors of jobs  the value of their homes  their savings  and all that pushed the american dream even further out of reach for too many working people  but you know what  we've spent the last   years digging ourselves out of that hole  we averted a depression  created   million new jobs    in manufacturing  we saved an auto industry  we made sure that we worked to make college more affordable  we worked to make sure that health care was secure for families  and what we discovered during the course of these difficult times is that a crisis doesn't change our character  it doesn't change who we are as a people  it doesn't change what makes us great  our toughness  our grit  our resilience  and our ability to come together and work together on behalf of this country  and when we came together in   we understood that there is a core decency  that there is a goodness to the american people  and we need to make sure that that's reflected in what happens in washington  and our mission has never been more urgent  so after   tough years  we're still going  we're here to build an economy where hard work pays off  so that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from  here in america  you can make it if you try  that's what this campaign is about  colorado  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  now  understand  there are no quick fixes or easy solutions to some of these challenges  but here's the thing that i constantly am reminded of wherever i travel across the country  we have the capacity to meet any challenge  because we've still got the best workers in the world  we've got the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best scientists and researchers in the world and the best colleges and the best universities in the world  we're still a young nation  and we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity  and people want to come here from every corner of the globe  and so no matter what the naysayers tell us  no matter how dark the other side tries to make things look  the fact is  there is not another country on earth that would not gladly trade places with the united states of america  so we can solve our problems  what's standing in our way is not that we don't have good ideas or we don't have solutions to problems like energy independence or improving our schools  what is standing in our way is our politics  you've got a bunch of folks in washington who think the only way is their way and who think that the only way to go forward is to go right back to the same policies that got us into this mess in the first place   i audience members i  no   i the president i  they believe in the old top down economics that we spent an entire decade trying and that did not work  and look  i'm not exaggerating here  my opponent  mr  romney  and his friends in congress  when you look at their economic ideas  when you look at  you know  they've spent a lot of time on commercials  saying how there aren't enough jobs and the economy is not growing fast enough  and then you ask them  okay  well  what is it that you're thinking about doing  and you know  i am not exaggerating  it boils down to two things  first of all  they want to give more tax cuts to folks at the very top   i audience members i  boo   i the president   i five trillion dollars' worth of tax cuts on top of the bush tax cuts  and then so that's idea number one  idea number two is let's get rid of regulations that we put into place to make sure that wall street does not misbehave again and we don't have another meltdown or getting rid of regulations that help protect our air and our water or getting rid of regulations that protect consumers from unscrupulous lenders  that's their basic idea  you get rid of regulations  and you cut taxes for wealthy americans  and somehow jobs and prosperity will all rain down on all of us   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  this is the path they're proposing  if you think i'm exaggerating  you go to their web sites  you look at the bills that have been passed by this house of representatives  that is where they will take us if they win  in fact  the centerpiece of mr  romney's entire economic plan is this new   trillion tax cut  and now  i want you to pay attention here  we're going to do a little math  i know it's not everybody's favorite subject  but math is important   i audience member i  i love math   i the president i  i like that  somebody said they love math  there you go  all right  so we've known for a while that a lot of this new   trillion tax cut would go to the wealthiest   percent of all households  but last week  an independent nonpartisan organization crunched the numbers  they looked  what does this mean    trillion  keep in mind  by the way  the defense budget is about   billion  so a   trillion tax cut is over   years is like a tax cut that's as big as our entire defense budget every single year  all right  so these guys were trying to analyze what does this mean  they found that governor romney's plan would raise taxes on middle class families with children by an average of    i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  the reason is as he says that this   trillion tax cut he'll pay for by doing other things  by slashing education or making medicare into a voucher   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  but even after he makes all the cuts to education and training and science and research and transportation and environmental protection  you name it  it turns out  he is still short  so the only way that you could actually pay for it is to have you pick up the bill  so you would then pay   extra every year not to reduce the deficit  not to help our kids get an education  not to rebuild our roads and our bridges or lay broadband lines into rural communities  he would ask the middle class to pay more in taxes so he could give another   to people making more than   million a year   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  he was asked about this  his campaign was asked about it  and if this sounds like an idea that would be difficult to explain to the american people  you're right   i laughter i  let's just say there was a whole different kind of gymnastics being performed by mr  romney than what's been happening in the olympics   i laughter i  so they were twisting  and they were turning and doing backflips and trying to say  well  this is a biased report  despite the fact that the head of this nonpartisan center used to work for president bush  but it's not surprising that he was trying to scramble a little bit  because they've tried to sell this old  trickle down tax cut fairy dust before   i laughter i  and you know what  it did not work then  it won't work now  it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to lower the deficit  it's not a plan to move our economy forward  it's not a plan to build the middle class  we don't need more tax cuts for folks like me  we need tax cuts for working americans who are trying to raise a family and keep our families healthy and send our kids to college and keep a roof over their heads  that's who needs some help  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for president  to fight for you  now  you guys still bending your knees   i laughter i  all right  you got some water  get hydrated   i audience member i  sing for us   i the president i  michelle made me promise that i can't sing to others anymore b   b i audience members i  boo   i the president   i because she wants me to just sing to her  you know   i laughter i  but look  grand junction  i've got a different plan for america  their ideas aren't going to work  four years ago  i promised to cut middle class taxes  that's exactly what i've done  the typical family has seen their taxes go down by about   so when you talk to your friends or neighbors and they say  he's a big  spending  tax raising democrat i laughter i you've got to tell them  no  actually  if you're in the middle class  your taxes have gone down  so now i want to keep taxes exactly where they are for the first   of everybody's income  so if your family makes under  which  by the way    percent of americans do    percent of small businesses do you will not see your income taxes increase by a single dime next year  that's my plan  and by the way  i've told congress i told the republicans in congress i said  let's do it now  you guys say you don't want to see anybody's taxes go up  i don't want to see anybody who's making   or less see their taxes go up  let's go ahead and sign a bill  but shockingly enough i laughter i they haven't agreed so far  because they're holding you guys hostage to try to get tax cuts for the top   percent  now  look  if you're fortunate enough to be in the other   percent of americans  you're still going to get a tax cut on the first   of your income  so if you make   the first   you're still keeping all that tax cut  it's just that little bit over   now  if you're making   million  you can afford it  right  all we're asking for folks who have been blessed like me i mean  i'm not being self interested here  it's not like i love paying taxes  but i understand i've got certain obligations because this country has been so good to me  so what i've all we're saying is for folks in the top   percent  let's go back to what we were paying under bill clinton  let's contribute a little bit more so we pay down our deficit and we can still invest in things like education that help our kids succeed  now  keep in mind  just in case you're talking to your friends or neighbors again and they say  well  that just a little bit of tax increase on the top   percent  that won't cut the deficit  they're right  we got to do more  so we've already cut a trillion dollars  federal spending is growing at a slower rate than any time since dwight eisenhower  i'll make sure government continues to do its part  and we'll cut out spending we don't need  but i'm not going to pay for a massive new tax cut for millionaires and billionaires by gutting investments that have always made us strong as a country  and by the way  just like we tested their plan under the previous administration and it didn't work  we've tested my plan because  as you'll recall  under bill clinton  when those taxes were a little bit higher on folks like me  the economy grew faster than it has in years    million new jobs  we went from a deficit to a surplus  and folks at the top did well  we created a lot of millionaires to boot  and the reason is that  look  when a construction worker has a got a little money in his pocket  now he starts thinking about buying a new car  when a teacher has security in her job  now she might go to a restaurant once in a while  and so what happens is  when the middle class is strong  suddenly  businesses have more customers  businesses have more profits  businesses decide to hire more workers  everybody does well  that's how we build a strong economy  not from the top down  from the middle out  from the bottom up  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term for president of the united states   i audience members i  obama  obama  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  let me say  you can see how this plays out on a whole bunch of issues  not just taxes and the deficit  when the american auto industry was on the brink of collapse  more than   million jobs at stake  governor romney says  let's  let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i said let's bet on american workers  and the american auto industry has come roaring back  so now i want to make sure that the jobs of tomorrow  including advanced manufacturing jobs  that they're not taking root in china or germany  i want them to take root in colorado  in ohio  in michigan  governor romney and i have a different theory  he spent his private sector experience investing in companies that were called  pioneers  of outsourcing  i want to insource  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give those tax breaks to companies that are investing in colorado  investing in grand junction  hiring american workers  selling american products  stamping those goods with three proud words  made in america  that's what i believe  mr  romney says it was  tragic  for me to end the war in iraq  like i promised  i think after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building here at home  thanks to the incredible service of our men and women in uniform  iraq is in charge of its own destiny  we are bringing troops home from afghanistan  we went after bin laden and al qaida  and we got them  so now let's take half of the savings that we were spending on war  and let's use it to put people back to work rebuilding schools  rebuilding bridges  rebuilding roads  improving our airport systems  improving our ports so that we can move goods and services that will make our economy strong not just now  but in the future  and by the way  that also helps us pay for providing services that our men and women in uniform have earned  our veterans fought too hard for us for them to have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  that is a sacred trust we've got to keep  i'm running to make sure america once again leads the world in educating our kids  i want to hire new teachers  especially in math and science  help   million people go to community colleges to train for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  and i want to make sure that every young person can afford to go to college  we have already expanded student aid  now we need to bring tuitions down  that's why i'm running for president  to give our young people a chance  on every issue  there's a difference  on housing and foreclosures  mr  romney says let the market just bottom out  i say let's let every american refinance their homes at historically low rates  save   per family  per homeowner  that could actually boost the economy and strengthen the housing market  when it comes to health care  he wants to kill obamacare  i'm implementing obamacare because it was the right thing to do  already  as we speak    million young people under the age of   can stay on their parent's plan  millions of seniors have saved hundreds of dollars on their prescription drugs  and we're closing the doughnut hole  individuals and businesses are getting rebates from their insurance companies because insurance companies have to use most of the money they get in premiums to provide care  not for ceo bonuses and administrative costs  if your child has a preexisting condition  insurance companies can't turn them down  soon  adults who have preexisting conditions cannot be turned down  so if that's what mr  romney wants to get rid of despite the fact that he did the same thing in massachusetts and it worked pretty well i laughter i then that's a different that's a choice in this election  you know  i don't think we should be refighting some of the battles he wants to refight  i think it was the right thing to do to end  don't ask  don't tell  i think you should be able to serve your country no matter who you are  i don't think it makes sense for us to take away control that women have over their own health care decisions  but most of all  most of all  i want to make sure that that original bargain that made this country great  that basic idea that if you work hard you can make it  that that is restored  and everything we do from health care to education  to manufacturing  to our infrastructure  to our investment in science and research all of this is designed to make sure that we've got a strong middle class going forward  that no matter what you look like  where you come from  that everybody has got a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules  that's the same promise our parents and our grandparents and our great grandparents believed in  and now we've got to pass on that same promise to the next generation  now  over the last over the next   months  days  to be precise i laughter i the other side will be spending more money than we've ever seen  you've got these guys writing   million checks  you've got these super pacs that are just going crazy   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and now  here's the thing  i don't know why they're running all these ads  because basically  they only have one ad  it's just a variation on the same ad  which is  the economy is not where it should be and it's obama's fault  that's their basic argument  because they know they can't sell their actual plans  they don't have plans  their message is designed to try to win an election  but it's not a plan to create jobs  they don't have a plan to grow the economy  they don't have a plan to revive the middle class  but i do  and so when you're talking to your friends and your neighbors  and they say  well  i don't know  mr  romney  he ran a business and i think maybe that might work  look  if you believe that trying what we already tried and it didn't work is worth trying again  if you believe it's okay to cut taxes for folks who are doing really well and ask folks who are struggling to do more  if you think it's okay for us to cut back on our investments in education and science and set our sights lower  then their that's your choice  that's how our democracy works  try it out  but you know what  if you believe that we're on the right track if you think like i do that we've come too far to turn back now then i'm going to need you  colorado  we've got too many good jobs to create  we've got too many good teachers to hire  we've got too many great schools to build  we've got too many students we need to help go to college  we've got too much homegrown clean energy to generate  we've got more troops to bring home  we've got more doors of opportunity to open to everybody who is willing to work hard  to walk through that door  we've got to leave something behind for the next generation so they can do even better  so they can do even bigger than we ever imagined  that's what's at stake  that's why i'm running  and if you're willing to stand with me and if you still believe in me just like i believe in you  we will win  colorado  we will win this election  we'll finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  denver  oh  it is good to be back in denver   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  well  i tell you what  we win colorado  i'll get   more years  a couple of people i just want to acknowledge  first of all  i just want to say thank you to sandra for that wonderful introduction  she is one tough and poised young lady  she was generous to stand up for her friend  she was brave to stand up for herself and an eloquent advocate for women's health  and i suspect she's going to be doing some even greater things as time goes on  so give her a big round of applause  a couple other people i want to acknowledge  your own mayor  michael hancock is in the house  one of the best senators in the country  michael bennet is in the house  a passionate advocate for working families  ed perlmutter is here  my dear friend  campaign cochair  former mayor  former secretary of transportation and energy i'm getting tired just listing his resume federico pena is in the house  he's here somewhere  where did federico go  and finally  i also want to acknowledge another campaign cochair  john register  a veteran and paralympian  we are very proud of him  john register  it's been   weeks since i was last here in colorado  and  well  as many of you know  i was in aurora to meet those who lost loved ones during that terrible shooting  and i just had a chance to see some of the first responders who helped to save lives and comfort families during that terrible  terrible day  unfortunately  since that time  we've had another tragedy in oak creek  wisconsin  where six members of our community were killed as they entered into a house of worship  and so i think we can all acknowledge  we've got to put an end to this kind of senseless violence  whether it's in aurora  whether it's in oak creek  whether it's in tucson  whether it's in cities all across america where too many lives are cut short because of senseless violence  this is going to have to stop  and as an american family as one american family we're going to have to come together and look at all the approaches that we can take to try to bring an end to it  and i want you to all know that the thoughts and prayers of the entire nation remain with those in aurora  and even though the perpetrators of these acts have received a lot of attention  attention on them will fade and what will be replaced are the stories of heroism and hope that we've seen here in colorado and in wisconsin and across the nation  that's what we'll remember  that's what's going to matter  that's what we will value  the strength and the resilience and the care and the love of the american people  now  unless you've managed to completely avoid your television set i laughter i or your cable is broken  you are aware that there is a pretty intense campaign going on right now  and the reason it's intense is because the choice that we face in november could not be bigger  it's not just a choice between two candidates  it's not even just a choice between two parties  more than any election in recent memory  this is a choice between two fundamentally different paths for our country's future  and the direction that you choose the direction you choose when you walk into that voting booth   months from now will have a direct impact not just on your lives  but on the lives of your children and the lives of your grandchildren  and that's true for everybody  but it's especially true for the women in this country  from working moms to college students  to seniors  because when it comes to the economy  it's bad enough that our opponents want to take us back to the same policies of the last decade  the same policies that got us into this mess in the first place  the same policies that saw jobs going overseas and ended up seeing people's wages and incomes going down even as the costs of everything from health care to college were going up  policies that culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression and that we've spent  now    years trying to recover from  that's bad enough  but when it comes to a woman's right to make her own health care choices  they want to take us back to the policies more suited to the  s than the  st century  and  colorado  you've got to make sure it does not happen  the decisions that affect a woman's health  they're not up to politicians  they're not up to insurance companies   i audience members i  no   i the president i  they're up to you  and you deserve a president who will fight to keep it that way  that's the president i've been  that's the president i will be if i get a second term as president of the united states  to keep moving this country forward  on the issues that matter  you don't have to take my word for it  you can take me at my record  four years ago  i delivered on my promise to pass health reform before the end of my first term  that's what we did  the affordable health the affordable care act  also known as obamacare i actually like the name i laughter i because i do care  that's why we fought so hard to make it happen  the affordable care act helps make sure you don't have to worry about going broke just because one of your loved ones gets sick  insurance companies can no longer place lifetime limits on your care  they can no longer jack up your premiums without reason  they can no longer drop your coverage when you need it most  they can no longer discriminate against children with preexisting conditions  and pretty soon  they'll no longer be able to deny you coverage based on a preexisting condition  like breast cancer or cervical cancer  or charge you more for care just because you're a woman  they can't do that anymore  those days are over  this is a law that allows young adults under the age of   to stay on their parents' health care plans  and that's already helped   million young americans  if you're a little bit over   it gives seniors a discount on their prescription drugs  a discount that's already saved millions of seniors on medicare hundreds of dollars each  right now nearly   million americans are getting a rebate from insurance companies that's right  they're sending you a check because under the law  we've capped the amount of money that they can spend on administrative costs and ceo bonuses instead of your health care  and when they violate that rule  they've got to send you a check  last year  obamacare secured new access to preventive care like mammograms and cancer screenings with no co pay  no deductible  no out of pocket cost for more than   million women  last week  insurance companies began covering even more services  and now most health plans are going to begin covering the cost of contraceptive care  now  understand this is crucial for women's health  doctors prescribe contraception not just for family planning  but as a way to reduce the risk of ovarian and other cancers  and it's good for our health care system in general  because we know the overall cost of care is lower when women have access to contraceptive services  and listen  we recognize that many people have strongly held religious views on contraception  which is why we made sure churches and other houses of worship  they don't have to provide it  they don't have to pay for it  we worked with the catholic hospitals and universities to find a solution that protects both religious liberty and a woman's health  so the fact is nearly   percent of women have relied on contraception at some point  and more than half of all women between the ages of   and   have struggled to afford it   i audience member i  thank you   i the president i  and we're changing that  before health care reform  many health care plans charged high deductibles or co pays for all these preventive services  or they just didn't cover them at all  and according to one study  more than half of all women put off the care they needed because of that  how many of you have gone without care that you needed or a checkup because you knew that you might not be able to afford the insurance co pays  and you had to choose between gas or groceries or your kid's new soccer uniform  i don't think a working mom in denver should have to wait to get a mammogram just because money is tight  i don't think a college student in colorado springs should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs  that's why we passed this law  it was the right thing to do  now  my opponent has a different view  as sandra said  he said he would take the affordable care act and  kill it dead  on the first day of his presidency kill it dead   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  which  i mean  just understand what this means  this means  year olds    million young people don't have health insurance  the preventative care gone  seniors paying more for prescription drugs  preexisting conditions  you're out of luck  then he said he'd  get rid of  planned parenthood   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  then he said he would have supported an extreme measure in mississippi that could have outlawed some forms of contraception   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  then he joined the far right of his party to support a bill that would allow any employer to deny contraceptive coverage to their employees  so it would be up to the employer to decide   i audience members i  boo   i the president i   your boss telling you what's best for your health and your safety  now  let me tell you something  denver  i don't think your boss should get to control the health care that you get  i don't think insurance companies should control the care that you get  i don't think politicians should control the care that you get  i think there's one person to make these decisions on health care  and that is you  you should make that decision  mr  romney is running as the candidate of conservative values  there's nothing conservative about a government that prevents a woman from making her own health care decisions  he says he's the candidate of freedom  but freedom is the chance  the opportunity to determine for yourself the care that you need  when you need it  it's the ability to change jobs or start your own business without fear of losing your health insurance  we're not going back to the days when it was acceptable to charge women more than men for health care  and we're not going back to the days when women with preexisting conditions  like being a cancer survivor  were denied affordable care  we're not going to kick more than a million young women off their parent's plan  we are not going backwards  denver  we're moving forward  that's why i'm running for president again  and understand this  at a time when women make up nearly half the workforce  an increasing share of family breadwinners  these aren't just health issues  and they're not just women's issues  these are economic issues  they affect every family in america  think about it  think about what it means when a woman is the main breadwinner for her family  but she's taking less pay home  doing the same work as a man  just because she's a woman  that's not right   i audience members i  no   i the president i  when my opponent's campaign was asked if he'd fight to guarantee an equal day's pay for an equal day's work  you know what the campaign said  they said   we'll get back to you on that   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  that's not a good answer   we'll get back to you on that  he won't say what he'd do about it  you've got my answer  upholding the principle of equal pay for equal work was the first bill i signed into law  the lilly ledbetter act  first bill i signed  and one other thing  today is the  year anniversary of sonia sotomayor taking her seat on the supreme court  yesterday was the  year anniversary of elena kagan taking her seat on the supreme court  so let's be very clear  the next president could tip the balance of the court in a way that turns back the clock for women and families for decades to come  the choice between going backward and moving forward has never been so clear  and let me say this  when i talk about women's issues  i'm talking about the experiences that i've seen in my own life  everybody knows michelle  the fact that we are partners in this process  this journey of life  has been my source of strength  and i want to make sure that she has control over her health care choices  i want to make sure that when she's working  she is getting paid the same as men  i've got to say  first ladies right now don't i laughter i even though that's a tough job  you know  my own mom would have been   years old this year  and my sister and i lost her to cancer when she was just   years old  and she got to meet michelle  but she never got a chance to meet her granddaughters or watch them grow up  and i often think about what might have happened if a doctor had caught her cancer sooner  or if she had been able to spend less time focusing on how she was going to pay her bills and more time on getting well   i audience member i  she is still with us   i the president i  she is still with us  she is in a better place  i think about malia and sasha  and i think to myself  well  we're not going to have an america where they have fewer opportunities than somebody's sons   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i don't want them having fewer choices than anybody's boys do  and then    years ago  as i had the privilege to travel all across this country and meet americans from all walks of life  i heard so many stories like mine  and i decided nobody else should have to endure the heartbreak of a broken health care system  no one in the wealthiest nation on earth should go broke because they get sick  nobody should be able to tell their daughters or sons that the decisions they can and cannot make for themselves are constrained because of some politicians in washington  and thanks to you  we've made a difference in people's lives  thanks to you  there are folks that i meet today who have gotten care and their cancer has been caught  and they've got treatment  and they are living full lives  and it happened because of you  because of your efforts   years ago  and  denver  we've come too far to turn back now  we've got too much work to do to implement health care  we've got too much work to do to create good jobs  we've got too many teachers that we've got to hire  we've got too many schools we've got to rebuild  we've got too many students who still need affordable higher education  there's more homegrown energy to generate  there are more troops that we've got to bring home  there are more doors of opportunity that we've got to open to anybody who's willing to work hard and walk through those doors  we've got to keep building an economy where no matter what you look like or where you come from  you can make it here if you try  and you can leave something behind for the next generation  that's what at stake right now  colorado  that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  that's why i'm asking for your vote  i still believe in you  and if you still believe in me  and if you're willing to stand with me  and knock on some doors with me  and make some phone calls with me  and talk to your neighbors and friends about what's at stake  we will win colorado  and if we win colorado  we will win this election  we will finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  pueblo  hello  colorado  it's good to be back  it is good to be back  and thank you so much for being here  this is a good looking crowd  can everybody please give crystal a big round of applause for that great introduction  there are a couple other people i want to acknowledge  first of all  one of our campaign cochairs  former secretary of transportation  former secretary of energy  former mayor  good friend  please give a big round of applause to federico pena  and we've got one of the finest senators that the state of colorado ever had  who is now doing a great job looking after the natural resources of this beautiful country of ours  your own secretary of interior ken salazar  it is great to be with all of you  we spent the night here last night  and everybody has been so hospitable  and then  this morning  before we came here we stopped by romero's for some green chili  i got to admit that we're saving some to take back to the white house   i laughter i  so i'm going to work with the white house chefs to see if we can figure out some of the secrets here   i laughter i  but listen  unless you've been able to hide from your tv set or your cable is broke  you're probably aware right now that we've got a pretty intense campaign going on  and the reason it's so intense is because the choice that we face this november could not be bigger  it's not just a choice between two candidates  it's not just a choice between two parties  more than any election in recent memory  this is a choice between two fundamentally different paths for our country  two fundamentally different visions of where this country needs to go  and the direction that we choose the direction that you choose when you walk into that voting booth in november it won't make a difference just in our lives  it will make a difference in our kids' lives and our grandkids' lives for decades to come  now  remember that   years ago  we came together as democrats  but also independents and republicans to restore the basic bargain that built the greatest middle class and the most prosperous economy the world has ever known  and it's a bargain that says it's very simple it says  if you work hard  hard work should be rewarded  it's an idea that says if you put in the effort  if you take responsibility for yourself and your community  you should be able to find a job that pays the bills  you should be able to afford a home that you can call your own  you should be able to count on health care if you get sick  you should be able to retire with dignity and respect  and most importantly  you should be able to give your kids the kinds of education and opportunity that lets them dream even bigger than you dreamed and do even better than you did  that idea is at the heart of america  that's the american promise  now  we understood that restoring that promise wouldn't be easy  it would take more than one year or one term or even one president  after all  we had been coming off a decade in which the middle class had been getting hammered  jobs had been getting shipped overseas  wages and incomes were going down  the cost of everything from health care to groceries was going up  and it all culminated in the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  a crisis that robbed too many of our friends and neighbors of their jobs and their homes and their savings and put the american dream even further out of reach  so we knew that we had a lot of work to do  and over the last   years  we have focused on righting the ship  making sure that we didn't slip into a depression  saving an auto industry  creating   million new jobs  half a million new manufacturing jobs  getting health care done  helping young people go to college  we have been working to get us moving forward  to get moving forward  and as tough as things have been and we know our job is not done yet what we've learned over these last   years is that the crisis didn't change who we are  it hasn't changed our character  it hasn't changed what has made us great  it hasn't changed why we came together  what we believe in  why we feel such an urgency to get to work  because we understand that we need to build an economy where hard work pays off  so that no matter who you are  what you look like  where you come from  what your last name is  here in america  you can make it if you try  that's what this campaign is about  colorado  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  now  look  there are no quick fixes  there are no easy solutions to the challenges we face  but i know in my bones that we have the capacity to meet those challenges  think about what we've got going for us  we've still got the best workers in the world  we've got the best business people in the world  we've got the best scientists  the best researchers  the best colleges  the best universities  we are a young nation  and we've got a diversity of talent and ingenuity that comes from every corner of the globe  so when you hear people saying  america is in decline or you hear folks for political reasons trying to paint things as dark as they can  let me tell you something  there isn't a country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states of america  what is standing in our way right now isn't the lack of technical solutions or good plans  what's standing in our way is the politics in washington  folks who think compromise is a dirty word  folks who think the only thing we can do to grow the economy is to go back to the same top down economics that got us into this mess in the first place   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and i promise you  that's their only idea  to go back to the things that didn't work  mr  romney  his friends in congress  they believe they've got two ideas  one  tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  two  they want to get rid of regulations that help keep our air and water clean  regulations that protect our consumers  regulations that make sure that wall street doesn't do the same kinds of things that created the financial crisis  and their idea is  is that if we give these big tax cuts to folks who don't need them and are doing really well and we let corporations run roughshod  even if they're not doing the right thing  that somehow that's going to lead to jobs and prosperity for everybody  that's what they're proposing  that's what they will do if they win this election   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  crystal mentioned this  the centerpiece of mr  romney's entire economic plan is a new   trillion tax cut  a lot of it is going to the wealthiest americans  but last week  we found out he expects the middle class to pick up the tab to pay for it   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  so you've got a   trillion tax plan and to pay for it you raise taxes on middle class families with children by an average of   not to reduce the deficit  not to grow jobs  not to invest in education  but just to give another   tax cut to people making more than   million a year   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  you know what  they have tried to sell us this trickle down  tax cut fairy dust before  it did not work  it did not work then  it is not going to work now  it is not a plan to create jobs  it is not a plan to cut the deficit  it's not a plan to move our economy forward  we do not need i do not need a tax cut  we don't need tax cuts for folks who are doing really  really  really well  we need to keep taxes low for working americans like you  we need to keep tax cuts in place for families who are trying to raise kids and keep them healthy and send them to college and keep a roof over their heads  and that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  four years ago  i promised that i would cut middle class taxes  i kept that promise  and the average middle class family  their taxes are about   lower than when i came into office  so if you talk to your friends and they say  oh  he's some big taxing democrat  you tell them  actually  he's cut your taxes  now i want to keep taxes exactly where they are on the first   of everybody's income  so if you're a family making under  which is   percent of american families you won't see your income taxes go up by one single dime  now  if you're fortunate enough to be in the other   percent  if you make more than   a year  you still get a tax cut on your first   but if you make   million  then we're going to go take the rest of it and tax that a little bit more at the rate we taxed it under bill clinton  and listen  the reason we do that is not because we love taxes  i would end up having to pay more under my plan  but and it's not like i love paying taxes  but i understand that i've got to do a little bit more  i've been so blessed  and it will help us bring down our deficit and invest in things like education that will help us grow as an economy   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  understand also  we're going to make sure that government does its part  we've already cut a trillion dollars of spending that we didn't need  and we'll keep streamlining government to make it more effective  but we're just asking folks like me to go back to the rates we paid under bill clinton  and that was a time when the economy created nearly   million new jobs  the biggest budget surplus in history  and it actually was good for businesses and good for folks at the top too  because you know what happens  if a steelworker or a construction worker  they've got a job and they've got a little more money in their pockets  maybe they buy that new car  and that means that now that business has more profits  maybe they hire more workers  if a teacher or a receptionist has a little bit more money in their pockets  maybe they go over to another restaurant  maybe they go to romero's  and they eat out  and now the restaurant hires a couple more workers  everybody does better  that's how the economy grows best  from the middle out  from the bottom up  not from the top down  when all of us share in prosperity  we all do better  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for president  because i believe we're all in this together  we've got a bunch of examples of the differences  the choice in this election  when the american auto industry was on the brink of collapse  more than   million jobs at stake  governor romney said  let's  let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i said i believe in american workers  i believe in this american industry  and now the american auto industry has come roaring back  and gm is number one again  so now i want to do the same thing with manufacturing jobs not just in the auto industry  but in every industry  i don't want those jobs taking root in places like china  i want them taking root in places like pueblo  now  governor romney brags about his private sector experience  but it was mostly investing in companies  some of which were called  pioneers  of outsourcing  i don't want to be a pioneer of outsourcing  i want to insource  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the united states of america  making american products with american workers and selling them around the world  that's why i'm running for a second term  here's another difference  at a moment when homegrown energy  renewable energy is creating new jobs in states like colorado and iowa  my opponent wants to end tax credits for wind energy producers   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  think about what that would mean for a community like pueblo  the wind industry supports about   jobs across this state  without those tax credits    american jobs  including potentially hundreds of jobs right here  would be at risk  colorado  it's time to stop spending billions in taxpayer subsidies on an oil industry that's already making a lot of profit  and let's keep investing in new energy sources that have never been more promising  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for president  i'm running because in   i promised to end the war in iraq  and i ended it  i promised to go after al qaida and go after bin laden  and we did it  we've set a timeline to end the war in afghanistan  to make afghans responsible for their own security  and we could not have done all this if it had not been for our outstanding men and women in uniform  here in pueblo  the home of heroes  you know what it means to care for our veterans  i want to thank you for everything you've done and are doing to look after our men and women who have worn the uniform  and i promise you that as long as i'm commander in chief  this country will care for our veterans and serve them as well as they've served us  nobody who has fought for our country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  so my plan will create a veterans job corps  so we can put returning heroes back to work as cops and firefighters in communities that need them  and i want to take about half the money that we're no longer spending on war  and let's put people back to work  do some nation building right here at home  let's renew our roads and our runways and our wireless networks  and let's work on our water infrastructure  here in the southwest  water is the lifeblood of our communities  it was   years ago  this month  that president kennedy came to pueblo and he signed the fry ark bill  today  my administration is making sure    years later  that you've got the resources to finish the job so that we are leaving your kids and your grandkids clean water  clean drinking water that is long overdue  that's the kind of investment in america that creates jobs now and makes life better for the future  that's what this election is about  that's the america we want to build  colorado  i'm running to make sure that we're once again the country that leads the world in education  i want to help our schools reward and hire the best teachers  especially in math and science  i want to give   million more americans the chance to study at community colleges and get the skills they need for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  i want to get colleges and universities to bring tuition down once and for all  because in the  st century  higher education is not a luxury  it's an economic necessity  and i want to make sure none of our young people who are willing to put in the effort are locked out of opportunity  so the stakes are big in this election on every issue  on homeownership  my opponent says  let's just let foreclosures bottom out  that's his answer  what i've said is  let's let every homeowner refinance at historically low rates  save you   that you can then spend to restore equity in your home or help your kids go to college  that is good for the economy  it'll be good for the housing market  mr  romney wants to reverse the affordable care act  obamacare  let me tell you something  right now   million young people can stay on their parent's plan because of the health care law i passed  millions of seniors are seeing lower prescription drug costs  we are going to make sure that if you've got a preexisting condition  you can now get health insurance  we're not going backwards  we're not going to take that away  and we're certainly not going to follow mr  romney's lead and go back to the days when women didn't have control of their own health care choices  women can make their own decisions  we don't need politicians doing it  mr  romney thinks  don't ask  don't tell  was a good idea  i think anybody who loves this country should be able to serve this country  that was the right thing to do  mr  romney believes in something called self deportation  thinks arizona is a model for immigration laws across the country   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i think we did the right thing to say that a young person who comes to america is brought here  is raised here  is friends with our kids  is going to school with our kids  is american in every single way except for a piece of paper should have the chance to be a part of the american family  that was the right thing to do  we're going forward  not backwards  on every single one of these issues  there is a choice  and it's about whether we go back to the failed policies of the past or whether we actually finally start once again working around that core idea that built this country  the idea that if you work hard here you can make it  the idea that in america  everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same set of rules  the idea that in america we rise or fall together and government can't solve every problem and it shouldn't try and it certainly can't help folks who are aren't willing to help themselves  but there are some things that we can do together as a people that makes us all better off  that makes our country strong  and that our economy works best when the middle class is growing and feels secure  now  i've got to tell you  we've got less than   months left in this election less than   months  time is flying  and over the next   months  you will see more negative ads  more money spent than you've ever seen in your life  i mean  these super pacs  these guys are writing   million checks and giving them to mr  romney's supporters   i audience members i  boo   i the president   i and basically  they all have just the same argument  they all say the same thing  they say the economy is bad and it's obama's fault  every ad is the same argument  now  let me tell you something  that may be a strategy to try to win an election  but they can't hide the fact that they don't have a plan to grow the economy  they don't have a plan to create more jobs  they don't have a plan to revive the middle class  i've got that plan  that's why i'm running  so when you talk to your friends and your neighbors  some of them may think we'll be better off if we cut taxes for the wealthy and get rid of every regulation  set our sights lower and stop providing the kind of assistance we need to kids to go to college  and you've got to tell them  look  if you think that's going to work better that's how democracy works you should vote for those other folks  feel free to try to send them to washington  but i believe and you believe we've come too far to turn back now  we've got too much more work to do  we've got too many good jobs we've got to create  we've got too many teachers we still need to hire  we've got too many schools we need to rebuild  we've got too many students we need to help go to college  we've got too much homegrown energy we need to generate right here in colorado  we've got more troops we need to come home  we've got more doors of opportunity that we need to open for every young person here in pueblo  here in colorado  all across the country  that's what's at stake right now  that's why i'm running for president  that's why i'm asking for your vote  not just for me  but for the country that you believe in  you've got to be registered to vote  we've got folks here who are ready to help you do that  here in colorado  you can register online  you go to gottaregister com  gottaregister com  but don't wait until the last minute  grab some friends  get online  let's get this done  back in   i made a promise to you  i said  i'm not a perfect man and i won't be a perfect president  but what i did say is i'd always tell you what i thought  i'd always tell you where i stood  and most importantly  i would spend every waking minute fighting as hard as i knew how for you  i have kept that promise  colorado  i kept that promise because i believe in you  i believe in this country  and if you still believe in me and you're willing to stand with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls with me and take your friends to the polls for me  i promise you we will win colorado  we will win this election  we will finish what we started  and we will remind the world why the united states is the greatest nation on earth  thank you very much  everybody  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  colorado  oh  what a beautiful day  can everybody please give christy a big round of applause for the great introduction  and then  i want everybody to acknowledge one of the outstanding alums of colorado college  an outstanding senator for this great state of colorado  an unbelievable secretary of the interior  looking after our natural resources  ken salazar  now  audience member  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  i really do  now  i have to say  first of all  this looks like a very smart crowd  which means that you've been spending a lot of time watching our olympic games and the unbelievable athletes and all the great training  right here  we've got do we have one of our outstanding athletes  thank you  colorado  because colorado springs has been a training site for all our outstanding athletes  and we're so proud of them  thank you so much  and for those of you who are curious  the women are doing pretty good right now in soccer  i know some of you may be the game is not over  and some of you may have dvr'd it  so i'm not going to say anything more   i laughter i  but we're making progress   i audience member i  moving forward   i the president i  moving forward  now  even though we've been spending most of our time  sensibly  watching the olympics  unless your cable is broken  you've probably also noticed there's this pretty intense campaign going on right now  and the reason it is an intense campaign is because the choice that we face in november could not be bigger  it's not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties  it is a choice between two fundamentally different visions about how we move this country forward  and the direction that we choose the direction you choose when you walk into that voting booth is going to have a direct impact not just on us  it will have an impact on our kids and our grandkids for decades to come  now    years ago  we came together and it wasn't just democrats  we had independents and even some republicans come together because we wanted to restore the basic bargain that made this country great  that built the greatest middle class and the most prosperous economy in the history of the world  and it's a bargain that says very simply  if you work hard  your work will be rewarded  if you work hard  you can get ahead  it's a deal that says if you put in enough effort  if you act responsibly  you can find a job that pays the bills  have a home you call your own  you can count on health care when you get sick  you can retire with dignity and respect  and most importantly  you can provide your kids with the education and opportunity so that they can dream bigger than you ever dreamed and they can achieve things you couldn't even imagine  that's the american promise  that's the core of who we are as a people  and unfortunately  we had gone through a decade where that dream felt like it was slipping away  jobs had gotten shifted overseas  incomes had gone down  when you account inflation  even though the cost of everything from health care to college had gone up  and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  so we knew restoring this dream  reinstating this basic bargain was not going to be easy  and we understood it would take more than one year or one term or maybe even one president  and that was before the middle class got clobbered by this financial crisis  and a lot of our friends and neighbors lost their jobs  lost their homes  lost their savings  and it made that dream seem even further out of reach  but here's the good news  the american people are tougher than tough times  not only is there a fundamental goodness and decency to the american people  but there's also grit and resilience  and when we get knocked down  we get back up  and so for the last   years  we've worked to make sure that we didn't slip into a great depression  and we created   million new jobs  we saved an auto industry on the brink of collapse  and although we are far away from where we need to be   i at this point  there was a disturbance in the audience i   i the president i  okay  we'll be okay  i hear you  what will happen is that the medical services we've just got somebody who fainted  which reminds me  everybody  if you've been standing for a long time  bend your knees a little bit  because this happens every time we have a rally  they'll be okay  just give them some space  and make sure that you drink some water if you've got some  now  we know that we've still got a long ways to go and the medical folks are coming right here  they're on their way  but you know  what hasn't changed as a result of this crisis is our character  what's made us great in the past is going to make us great in the future  we came together in   understanding that we had an urgent mission to make sure that here in america everybody gets a fair shot  everybody does their fair share  and everybody plays by the same set of rules  we're here to build an economy where hard work pays off  so that no matter who you are or where you come from  you can make it if you try  that's what this campaign is about  colorado  that's what the choice is in november  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  here's the good news  even though there are no quick fixes  there are no easy solutions some of these problems built up over decades  and they're not going to be solved overnight we've got everything we need to meet the challenges we face  we've got the best workers in the world  we've got the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best scientists and researchers in the world  we've got the best colleges  and we've got the best universities in the world  we're a young nation  we've got this incredible diversity of talent and ingenuity  people come here from every corner of the globe because they believe in our creed  they believe in our ideas  and so no matter what the naysayers say  no matter how bad folks try to paint the picture just to sell newspapers or sound sophisticated i laughter i the truth of the matter is  is that there's not a country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states of america  we've got what we need to succeed  what is standing in our way right now is our politics in washington  it's a bunch of folks who think compromise is a dirty word  who think that the right way forward is to go backwards to the same top down economic policies that got us into this mess in the first place  audience members  boo   i the president i  and look  mr  romney  his friends in congress  their basic economic plan is really simple to describe  it's not complicated  what they say is  on the one hand  they want to eliminate regulations on wall street banks  even after this crisis  or regulations on insurance companies or regulations on unscrupulous lenders or regulations that keep our air and water clean  so that's part number one  and then part number two big part of their plan is to cut taxes a lot more for the wealthiest americans  audience members  boo   i the president i  and the idea is that somehow  if you combine these two concepts  that this is going to lead to jobs and prosperity for everybody  that's what they're proposing  i'm not making this stuff up   i laughter i  go to their web sites  look at what the house republicans voted on  their budget  that's where they're going to take us if they win  that's their idea  and look  if you believe in that idea  then you're probably not going to be voting for me  mr  romney's the centerpiece of his entire economic plan is a new   trillion tax cut on top of the bush tax cuts  a big chunk of it going to the wealthiest americans  and last week  we found out that he expects you  middle class families  to pay for it  audience members  boo   i the president i  governor romney's tax plan this is not according to me  this is according to independent analysts assuming he kept his promise that it wasn't going to add to the deficit  would mean raising taxes on middle class families with children by an average of   and keep in mind  this would not be to pay down our deficit  it wouldn't be to grow jobs or invest in education or make college more affordable or invest in science and research or clean energy  because he wants to gut all those things  he wants to cut away that stuff  your tax increase would be to pay for another   tax cut for people making more than   million a year  audience members  boo   i the president i  how many people think that's a good idea  audience members  no   i the president i  how many people honestly believe that that's going to unleash incredible job growth in this country  audience members  no   i the president i  look  we have tried this before  they tried to sell us this trickle down  tax cut fairy dust before   i laughter i  and guess what  it didn't work  it didn't work then  it won't work now  it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to cut the deficit  it's not a plan to move our economy forward  we don't need more tax cuts for folks like me  we need tax relief for working families  we need tax cuts for folks who are trying to make sure their kids get a good education  trying to keep their kids healthy  trying to keep a roof over their heads  trying to send them to college  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  because our work is not yet done  i've got a different idea  four years ago  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  i did that  the average  typical family  their income taxes their tax burden is about   lower than it is now  i want to keep taxes exactly where they are for the first   of everybody's income  i've already told congress  let's get it done  we should do it before the election  now  if your family makes under  which  by the way  is   percent of american families and   percent of small businesses under my plan  your income taxes would not increase a single dime next year  that's my plan  but if you're fortunate enough to be in the other   percent  if this country has blessed you the way it's blessed me  you still get a tax cut on the first   of income  it's just that after that  we're going to ask you to contribute a little bit more so we can pay down our deficit responsibly and invest in things like helping young people go to college  invest in basic science and research  rebuild our roads all the things that help us grow and make the middle class strong  and by the way  this doesn't mean that we don't still have more work to do to make government more efficient  i'm not somebody who believes government can solve every problem  government has to do its part by cutting out spending that we don't need  we've already cut a trillion dollars a trillion that's with a  t out of our budget  and we can do more to make government more efficient  more customer friendly  but that doesn't do enough to bring down the deficit  so all i'm asking is that folks like me go back to the rates that we paid under bill clinton which  by the way  you may remember  we created   million new jobs  the biggest budget surplus in history  and we created a whole bunch of millionaires to boot  because what happens is  when a construction worker or a police officer  they've got a little more money to spend  you know what  maybe they go out and buy that new car  and suddenly  the car company has more profits  which means that hire more workers  and everybody does better  when a teacher or a receptionist has a little bit more money to spend  maybe they go to that local restaurant  maybe they buy a computer for their kid for school  and now  suddenly  all businesses are doing better  that's the history of america  when we grow from the middle class out  when we provide ladders of opportunity for those who want to get into the middle class and are willing to work hard to do it  everybody does well  top  middle  bottom  we are in this thing together  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  this difference in vision  it shows up on all sorts of issues  when the american auto industry was on the brink of collapse    million jobs at stake  mr  romney said   let detroit go bankrupt  i said  let's bet on america's workers  and we got management and workers to come together  making better cars than ever  and now gm is number one again  and the american auto industry has come roaring back  so now i want to say what we did with the auto industry  we can do it in manufacturing across america  let's make sure advanced  high tech manufacturing jobs take root here  not in china  let's have them here in colorado  and that means supporting investment here  governor romney talks about his private sector experience  but he invested in companies that were called  pioneers  of outsourcing  i don't want to outsource  i want to insource  let's reform our tax code  and let's make it simpler  and let's make sure that we're providing tax breaks to companies that are investing here in colorado springs  here in colorado  not overseas  they're the ones who need tax breaks  let's give tax breaks to companies that are investing here  it's the right thing to do  at a moment when homegrown energy is creating new jobs in states like colorado and iowa  my opponent wants to end tax credits for wind producers  audience members  boo   i the president i  the wind industry supports about   jobs across this technologiesstate  without those tax credits  jobs would be at risk    jobs across this country would be at risk  why would we want to stop promoting clean  renewable energy that can make our environment better  put people back to work  free our dependence from foreign oil  we should stop spending billions of taxpayer subsidies on the oil industry that is very profitable  let's keep investing in a clean energy industry that's never been more promising  that's the choice in this election  here's another choice  i promised in   i'd end the war in iraq  we ended it  i said we'd go after bin laden and al qaida  we did  we're transitioning in afghanistan and starting to bring our troops home  and so none of this could have been accomplished had it not been for our outstanding men and women in uniform  we are safer and more respected because of them  but now we've got to make sure that the country they come back to is going on all cylinders  so what i've said is  let's set up a veterans jobs corps that helps returning veterans get jobs as firefighters and police officers in communities that need them  let's make sure that they are getting the training that they need  and let's make sure that we take some of those savings that we are spending after a decade of war  let's do some nation building here at home  let's put people back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges  laying broadband lines  rebuilding our schools  putting in new science labs  i was just down in pueblo  and we were talking about a water project that john f  kennedy had signed  authorizing   years ago  years ago  it has never been funded  you know what  under my administration  it's getting funded  there are projects like that all across america  and we can put people back to work right now  that's good for the economy right now lower unemployment right now but it also lays the foundation for economic growth for decades to come  that's a choice in this election  i believe that we  once again  should be leading the world in educating our kids  so i've said  let's make sure that we're helping local school districts hire the best teachers  especially in math and science  let's help to provide millions of new slots at community colleges so people can train for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  and i want to make college and university tuitions lower so young people aren't burdened with tens of thousands of dollars' worth of debt  we can do it  because higher education is not a luxury  it's an economic necessity in the  st century  my opponent doesn't have a plan for higher education  he doesn't have a plan for homeownership  he was asked  what should we do about the housing crisis  he says  well  we'll just let foreclosures bottom out  that's not a plan  what i've said is let's help all families take advantage of historically low rates  refinance your homes  get an extra   a year  which you will then spend and will make the economy stronger and the housing market stronger  that's a choice in this election  doing nothing or putting   in your pocket  i'm running because i believe nobody in america should go broke because they get sick  mr  romney says he wants to repeal obamacare  audience members  boo   i the president i  let me tell you  i'll work with anybody to keep improving our health care system  but the supreme court has spoken  six and a half million young people are able to stay on their parent's plans now  seniors are getting discounts on their prescription drugs  insurance companies can't prevent you from getting health insurance if you've got a preexisting condition  folks are getting free preventive care  i think it was the right thing to do  we're not going backwards  we're going forwards  that's the choice in this election  we're not going back to  don't ask  don't tell  everybody should be able to serve the country they love  that's a choice in this election  helping out the  dream act  kids  that was the right thing to do  we're not going backwards  we're going forwards  that's a choice in this election  all these things tie together  because my vision is one in which whether we're talking about housing or education or rebuilding america the idea is you've got to show individual initiative  government can't solve all your problems  government can't help folks who won't help themselves  but there are things we can do to make sure that everybody has got a chance  everybody has got opportunity  if everybody is willing to work hard  they've got those rungs on the ladder to have a secure middle class life  that's the promise our parents passed down to us  that's why i'm standing here today  because somebody helped me along the way  that's the promise i want to pass on to the next generation  that's why i'm running for another term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i   i i the president i  now  over the next   months  the other side will spend more money than we've ever seen on ads that tell you the same thing we've been hearing for   years now  which is the economy is not good enough and it's obama's fault  basically  they should just have one commercial and they can just run it over and over again  because they don't say anything new   i laughter i  and the reason that's their argument is because they don't have a plan  and the plan they've got they can't sell  so they will do their best  like they've been trying to do for the last   years  to just run me down  the problem is they don't have a plan to create jobs  they don't have a plan to strengthen the economy  and they don't have a plan to revive the middle class  and i do  but in order to implement that plan  i'm going to have to have your help  this election is going to be close  colorado is going to be close  so i've got to make sure your friends are registered  i've got to make sure you're registered  in colorado  you can register online  so you got to go to gottaregister com that's  gotta  g o t t a   i laughter i  but we're going to have to work hard  here is the good news  here is the good news  i've been outspent before  i've been counted out before  but you know what we learned in   when the american people decide that they want to see change  they make it happen  when the american people come together and focus on those values that have made us strong  they cut through all the nonsense  it doesn't matter how much the other side spends  change happens  colorado  we've come too far to turn back now  we've got too many good jobs we still have to create  we've got too many teachers we've got to hire  we've got too many schools we've got to rebuild  too many students we want to send to college  we've got too much homegrown energy we still have to generate  too many troops we've still got to bring home  we've got too many doors of opportunity we still have to open up for everybody who is willing to work hard and walk through those doors  that's what's at stake right now  that's why i'm running  that's why i need your help  in   i said to you i am not a perfect man and i won't be a perfect president  but i promised you that i would spend every single day fighting as hard as i knew how for you  and i have kept that promise  because i still believe in you  and  colorado  if you still believe in me  if you're willing to work with me and stand with me and knock on doors with me and make phone calls with me  we will win colorado  and we will win this election  and we will finish what we started  and we will remind the world why america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  chicago  thank you  how's everybody doing  it is good to be back home  chicago looks good  and all of you look good   i at this point  audience members sang  happy birthday i   i the president i  thank you  thank you very much  it is true  i am now   michelle   i audience member i  so am i   i the president i  you are too  you look better than i do   i laughter i  michelle says i do not look a day over    i laughter i  there are a couple of people i want to acknowledge  first of all  dj vince adams  thank you so much  dj cassidy  thank you so much  my great friend  kal penn  thank you for all that you do  and everybody on the gen   host committee  thank you for the great job you guys did  now  we just had the olympics closing ceremony  we could not be prouder of our u s  athletes  bringing home the gold  conducting themselves as we would hope that somebody would conduct themselves representing the united states  they just did an outstanding job  and i know that all of you look like pretty smart folks  so you were spending most of your time watching the olympics  if you were watching tv  but unless your cable is broken  you probably also know we've got a pretty intense campaign going on right now  and the reason that this is such an intense campaign is because we could not have a bigger choice in front of us than the one that we face in november  it's not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties  more than any other election  this is a choice about two different visions for the country  for two different directions of where america should go  and the direction that we choose  the direction that you choose when you walk into that voting booth in november  is going to make a difference not just in your life  but in the lives of your children and in the lives of your grandchildren  it will make a difference for decades to come  now    years ago  we came together  not just democrats we had republicans  we had independents we came together because we felt as if the basic bargain that built this country was in danger  it was a bargain that said here in america  if you work hard  you can get ahead  the basic idea that if you act responsibly  if you are putting in all your effort  then you can find a job that pays the bills  you can find a home you can call your own  you can send your kids to college  you won't go bankrupt when you get sick  you can retire with dignity and respect  and most importantly  the next generation can dream even bigger and do even better than we ever imagined  that's the core of the american dream  that's the basic american promise that made us the envy of the world  that made us the most powerful economy in the world  that built the largest middle class in the world that idea that here in america  you can make it if you try  now  we had gone through a decade in which that basic compact seemed as if it wasn't true for too many people  folks at the top were doing very well  but for ordinary families all across america  it felt as if people were working harder  making less while the costs of everything from health care to college were going up  jobs were being shipped overseas  we ran two wars on a credit card  we turned surpluses into deficit  and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  now  we've spent the last   years trying to get us back on track  we saved an auto industry on the brink of collapse  we worked with the financial sector to start doing things the old fashioned way  lending to businesses and families  instead of engaging in reckless speculation  four and a half million new jobs have been created  half a million manufacturing jobs the most since the  s  but  chicago  we've got a long way to go  all of us know friends  neighbors  family members who are still out of work or whose homes are still underwater  too many folks are still burdened by enormous college debt  too many folks still don't have a sense that tomorrow will be better than today  and so the question in this election is  which way do we go  do we go forward towards a new vision of an america in which prosperity is shared  or do we go backward to the same policies that got us into this mess in the first place   i audience members i  forward   i the president i  i believe we have to go forward  i believe we've got to keep working to create an america where no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your last name is  no matter who you love  you can make it here if you try  that's what's at stake in november  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  now  the good news is even though there are no quick fixes to our challenges  we've got everything we need to make things work here in america  we still have the best workers in the world  we've still got the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best colleges  the best universities  the best scientists  the best researchers  we're a young nation  and we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity from every corner of the globe  witness this room  chicago is an example of what makes this country great  right  so what's holding us back is not the lack of big ideas or good plans  what's holding us back is a brand of washington politics that says we are not going to compromise  no matter what  it's gridlock and stalemates and dysfunction  and it's an idea propagated by the other side that somehow we're going to grow this economy from the top down  and that if people at the top are doing really  really well  then everybody else is automatically going to benefit   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  this kind of top down economics is central to governor romney  and it is central to his running mate  just yesterday morning  my opponent chose his running mate  the ideological leader of the republicans in congress mr  paul ryan  and i want to congratulate   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  no  no  no  look  i want to congratulate congressman ryan  i know him  i welcome him to the race  congressman ryan is a decent man  he is a family man  he's an articulate spokesman for governor romney's vision  but it's a vision that i fundamentally disagree with  my opponent and congressman ryan and their allies in congress  they all believe that if we just get rid of more regulations on big corporations and we give more tax breaks to the wealthiest americans  it will lead to jobs and prosperity for everybody else  that's what they're proposing  that's where they'll take us if they win  and this is not speculation  it's on their web sites  it's embodied in the budget that the house republicans voted for repeatedly  the centerpiece of governor romney's entire economic plan is a new   trillion tax cut  a lot of it going to the wealthiest americans  this is on top of the bush tax cuts  last week we found out that to pay for this   trillion tax cut  not only would we see them gut education investments   i audience members i  boo   i the president   i gut investments in science and research  gut investments in things like rebuilding our roads and our bridges  but it turns out that governor romney's tax plan would also raise taxes on middle class families by an average of   each   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  not to reduce the deficit  mind you  not to create more jobs  independent economists have looked at it  they said there's nothing in governor romney's plan that would create jobs right now  this would all be in order to give another   tax cut to people who are making   million a year or more   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  let me tell you something  they have tried this before  they have tried to sell us this trickle down fairy dust before   i laughter i  and guess what  it did not work  it did not work  it's not a plan to cut the deficit  it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to revive the middle class  it's not a plan to move our economy forward  we don't need more tax cuts for folks like me  we need to give tax relief to working americans  to middle class families  for folks who are trying to raise their kids and keep them healthy and send them to college and keep a roof over their heads  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  four years ago  i promised the american people i was going to cut taxes on middle class families  and that's what i did  the typical middle class family is actually paying   less in their taxes than when i came into office  and i want to keep income taxes exactly where they are for everybody who's making   a year or more  which is about   percent of the american people  and   percent of small businesses  so if your income is   a year or less  your income taxes will not go up a dime  on the other hand  if you're lucky enough  like i am  to be in the top   percent  what we've said is you can afford to do a little bit more so that we can pay down our deficit and still help young people go to college and still make sure that we're investing in basic research to cure things like alzheimer's and cancer  we're asking you to contribute a little bit more  and look  government is still going to have to do its part  we've already cut a trillion dollars of spending  an additional   trillion is slated to be made  we can cut out programs that don't work to make sure we can invest in the things that do  we can make government more streamlined  more efficient  but if we're really going to be serious about reducing the deficit and growing the economy  then for folks like me to go back and pay at the rates that existed when bill clinton was president  when we created   million new jobs  went from deficit to surplus  and created a whole bunch of millionaires to boot that is the right plan for america  and by the way  the reason that it's the right plan is because when a construction worker or a teacher or a receptionist when they've got a little money in their pocket  what do they do   i audience members i  spend it   i the president i  they maybe go out and buy that new car or buy that new appliance or go to a restaurant or  heaven forbid  they take a vacation once in a while   i laughter i  and so that means business has more customers  and they hire more workers  historically  that is how our economy has grown  not from the top down  but from the middle out  from the bottom up  when we create opportunity for everybody who works hard to get ahead  this economy grows  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  now  that choice you can see it in every issue between myself and mr  romney  when the auto industry was on the brink of collapse  governor romney said  let's  let detroit go bankrupt  i said  with a million workers and an iconic american industry on the line  i'm going to bet on the american worker  and you know what  three years later  gm is number one again and the american auto has come roaring back  that's the choice in this election  so now i want to make sure that high tech manufacturing takes root not in china  not in germany  but here in the united states  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in chicago  investing in cleveland  investing in pittsburgh  let's create jobs here in the united states  hiring american workers  making american products  selling them around the world  stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's the choice in this election  i'm running to make sure that after a decade of war  we start doing some nation building here at home  in   i promised we'd end the war in iraq  we've ended it  i said we'd go after al qaida and bin laden  we did  now we're beginning a transition in afghanistan  making afghans more responsible for their own security  and bringing our troops home  all of this is possible only because of the extraordinary men and women in uniform who protect our freedom every single day at great sacrifice to themselves  but the question now is what country are they coming back to  we want to give them a country full of opportunity  now  part of that means making sure that we're doing right by them  and as long as i am commander in chief  they are going to get the benefits that they have earned  because if you fought for america  you shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over your head when you come home  but it also means making sure the economy is absorbing all these folks who are coming home  which means i want to take about half of the money that we were spending on war and let's start investing it here in rebuilding our schools and roads and bridges  let's make sure that we're putting teachers back to work  there is so much that we can do with the savings that we had and it will make america stronger  it will make america safer not just for the next   years or the next   years  but for decades to come  that's the america we want to build  that's the choice in this election  i'm running because i want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world  so i want to help local school districts  i want to help local school districts hire and retain the best teachers  especially in math and science  i want to give   million more people the opportunity to go to community colleges and get trained for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  and i want to make sure  building on the work that we've already done  that we make college affordable not only by making sure that we continue to expand our efforts in pell grants and student loans  but also that we're making sure that colleges and universities are keeping their cost down  because higher education is no longer a luxury  it is an economic necessity in the  st century  and we've got to fight for it  that's the choice in this election  on every issue  there is a stark contrast  when it comes to homeownership  my opponent says  just let the foreclosures bottom out  that's not a solution  i want to make sure that homeowners across american can refinance at historically low rates  save   how many people here can use an extra   that would strengthen the housing market and put money in people's pockets that will make the economy stronger  my opponent says that we should go back to the days when folks went broke because they got sick  he wants to kill the affordable care act  also known affectionately as obamacare  i believe that it was the right thing to do for young people to be able to stay on their parent's plan  million young people have insurance that didn't have it before  i think it was the right thing to do to make sure that folks without preexisting conditions are able to get health insurance  i think it is the right thing to do for seniors to get discounts on their prescription drugs  i think it's the right thing to do for everybody to be able to get preventive care  including women who can have some control over their own health care decisions  we're not going backwards  we're going forwards  that's a choice in this election  we did the right thing to end  don't ask  don't tell  we're not going back  we're going forward  we did the right thing helping out  dream act  kids  we're not going to go backwards we're not going to go backwards  we're going forward  across the board  on these issues all of these things whether we're talking about manufacturing  a fair tax code  a strong housing market  affordable college  a k  system that works all these things stitch together  it has to do with how do we create security for middle class folks and how do we create ladders of opportunity for everybody  that's how we've always grown this economy  that is at the heart of what we believe that everybody who works hard has a shot  that everybody gets a fair shot  everybody does their fair share  everybody plays by the same set of rules a belief that we are in this together  that we are not all on our own  that's the vision that we put forward in   that is the vision that we are fighting for in   that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for president   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  let me just close up by saying this  we've got less than   months less than   months  that goes by quick  and as you get older  as you get to be like  i laughter i you will find out it goes by even quicker  and during this time we will see the other side spend more money through these super pacs than we've ever seen ever  i mean  they are writing   million checks  just they are just cranking it out  if you live in a battleground state  you cannot get away from their advertising  now  the reason they have to advertise like this is because they know their economic theories don't sell  they know we didn't get amnesia  we remember trying what they're selling  and it didn't work   i laughter i  so they're basically just going to repeat over and over again  the economy is not good and it's obama's fault  they'll have variations on the theme  but it's the same thing over and over again   i laughter i  now  that may be a plan to try to win an election  but it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to strengthen the economy  it's not a plan to revive the middle class  it's not a plan to make america stronger  it feeds into fear and the cynicism that so many americans feel about washington  but it's not a plan for hope  it's not it doesn't capture america at its best a big  bold  generous  optimistic america  and so the good news is we've been outspent before  i've been counted out before  but what has always given me faith  what's given me hope  what's given me confidence is you  it's all of you  it's the fact that when the american people come together  they cannot be stopped  when people power is harnessed  when you guys are out there knocking on doors  making things happen  you can't be stopped  so i'm going to need your help  we've come too far to go back now  we've got too many good jobs to create  we got too many teachers we need to hire  we've got too many schools we've got to rebuild  we've got too many students who need help affording college  we've got too much homegrown energy that we've got to generate  we've got more troops we've got to bring home  we've got more doors of opportunity that we have to open  and that's what's at stake  and so i am not just asking for your vote  i am asking for your work  i need your help over the next   months  i don't need you just knocking on doors  i need you to make phone calls  i need you to talk to your friends  i need you to talk to your neighbors  i need you guys to load up and go over into iowa  a battleground state  and knock on some doors and make some phone calls over there  we've got to get help  you've got to get involved in the election  you've got to get on our web site  you've got to make sure that you are signing up  if you are as passionate and as energized and as determined as you were before  then we won't lose  and it is true that i am older and a little grayer  but i made a promise to you in   i said i'd always tell you what i thought  i'd always tell you where i stood  and most importantly  i told you i would always  every single day  every minute of every day  think about you  and fight as hard as i knew how for you  i have kept that promise  i still believe in you  and if you still believe in me  and are willing to get out there and work over the next   days  we will not just win this election  but we will finish what we started and remind the world just why it is the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  chicago  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  iowa  it's good to be back  well  it is good to be back in iowa  i miss you guys   i audience members i  obama  obama  obama   i the president i  thank you  first of all  can everybody please give patricia a big round of applause for the great introduction  a couple other people i want to acknowledge  your outstanding former governor  now i think the best secretary of agriculture we've ever had  tom vilsack  congressman leonard boswell  and mayor tom hanafan  see  the sun is coming out  i love being back in iowa  now  we're starting here in council bluffs  but we're going to be heading east  and i think i'm going to end at the state fair  michelle has told me i cannot have a fried twinkie   i laughter i  but i will be checking out the butter cow  and i understand this year there's a chocolate moose   i laughter i  so i'm going to have to take a look at that if i can  the last time i went to the state fair  secret service let me do the bumper cars  but they said this year i wasn't president yet  so i could do that but not this time   i laughter i  now  before i get started  i just want to say a few words about the drought  because it's had such an impact on this state and all across the country  right now folks here in iowa and across the heartland we're suffering from one of the worst droughts in   years  farmers  ranchers depend on a good crop season to pay the bills and put a roof over their heads  and i know things are tough right now  the best way to help these states is for the folks in congress to pass a farm bill that not only helps farmers and ranchers respond to natural disasters  but also makes some necessary reforms and gives farmers and ranchers some long term certainty  unfortunately  right now too many members of congress are blocking the farm bill from becoming law   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i am told that governor romney's new running mate  paul ryan  might be around iowa the next few days  he is one of the leaders of congress standing in the way   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  so if you happen to see congressman ryan  tell him how important this farm bill is to iowa and our rural communities  we've got to put politics aside when it comes to doing the right thing for rural america and for iowa  now  it's always a problem waiting for congress  so in the meantime  i've made sure my administration  led by tom vilsack  is doing everything we can to provide relief to those who need it  so last week  we announced   million to help ranchers and farmers get more water to livestock and rehabilitate land affected by drought  and today we're announcing that the federal government will help livestock producers by purchasing over   million worth of meat and fish  right now  while prices are low  we'll freeze it for later  but we've got a lot of freezers   i laughter i  and that way  that will help ranchers who are going through tough times right now  and also over the long term  obviously  that food is going to be spent by folks at the pentagon and other places  america depends on farmers and ranchers to put food on the table  depends on farmers and ranchers to feed our families  so we've got to be there for them  not just today  but tomorrow  and every day until this drought passes  because we are americans  that's what we do  we take care of each other  and when tough times strike our neighbors  we give them a hand  now  that speaks to the larger idea of why i'm here  the notion that i'm my brother's keeper  i'm my sister's keeper  the idea that we're in this together  that was at the heart of the journey that began here in iowa   years ago  we spent a lot of time on bus tours like this one at school gyms and family farms and small businesses across this state  although  i have to say the bus we had wasn't as nice as this one  we used to get some buses   i laughter i  and you know  that campaign back in     it had plenty of ups and downs  but no matter what  you the people of iowa had my back  you had my back  when the pundits had written us off  when we were down in the polls  you believed in me  and i believed in you  and it was on your front porches and in your backyards where the movement for change in this country began  but our journey is not finished not yet  i'm going to spend the next   days driving all across this state just like i did in   from council bluffs to the quad cities  because once more  you face a choice in november  and that choice could not be bigger  it is not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties  more than any other election in recent memory  this is a choice between two fundamentally different visions of this country and the path that we have to take  and the direction that you choose when you walk into that voting booth in november is going to have an impact not just on your lives  but on your children's lives  your grandchildren's lives  for decades to come  this one counts  i mean  think   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  think about this  council bluffs  four years ago  we came together and it wasn't just democrats  it was independents and some republicans because we understood that we needed to restore the basic bargain that made this country great  the basic deal that created the greatest middle class and the most prosperous economy the world has ever known  and it's a simple bargain  it says  if you work hard  your work should be rewarded  if you act responsibly and you put in enough effort  you should be able to find a job that pays the bills  have a home you can call your own  count on health care when you get sick  put away enough to retire with dignity and respect  and most of all  give your kids an education that allows them to dream even bigger than you did and do even better than you did  that's the american promise  that's the american dream  and the reason we came together was because we had seen a decade in which that dream was being betrayed  we had gone through a decade where jobs were being shipped overseas  where you were working harder  but making less  while the cost of everything from health care to a college education kept on going up  and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  and so we knew that restoring the basic bargain that made this country was not going to be easy  we knew it would take more than one year or one term or even one president  and that was before the crisis hit and we saw friends and neighbors lose their jobs or lose their homes  lose their savings  pushing the american dream even further out of reach for too many working people  but you know  over the last   years  we've seen america's grit  you folks are tougher than any tough times  when we get knocked down  we stand back up  some workers lost their jobs  they went back to community college  got retrained  and now got a new job  small businesses kept their doors open by hook or by crook  and so  slowly  we've seen   million new jobs created  half a million new manufacturing jobs  the most since the great depression  the most since the  s  and what we realized was that no matter how bad the crisis was  one thing did not change  and that is the character of the american people and the resilience of the american people  and what hasn't changed is our determination to do what we came together in   to do  and that is to make sure that in america hard work pays off so that no matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like  you can make it here in america if you try  that's what this campaign is about  iowa  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  you know  i told you    years ago i said  there aren't going to be quick fixes  there won't be easy solutions  the challenges we face had been building up for decades  and that's still true today  but i want everybody to know that we have the capacity to meet every challenge  we've got the best workers in the world  we've got the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best colleges  the best universities  the best researchers in the world  the best scientists in the world  we're still a young nation  we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity  people come here from every corner of the globe  they want to be here  so whatever the naysayers may say or folks who try to make things look dark  listen  there is not another country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states of america  what's holding us back right now is washington politics   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  you've got folks on the other side who think compromise is a dirty word and whose main idea is to go back to the same old top down economics that got us into this mess in the first place  this weekend  my opponent  mr  romney  chose as his running mate the ideological leader of the republicans in congress  and i've got to tell you  i know congressman ryan  he's a good man  he's a family man  he is an articulate spokesman for governor romney's vision  but the problem is that vision is one that i fundamentally disagree with  governor romney and his allies in congress  they think that if we just get rid of more regulations on big corporations and give more tax breaks to the wealthiest americans  if we end medicare as we know it  make it a voucher system  then somehow this is all going to lead to jobs and prosperity for everybody   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  the centerpiece of mr  romney's entire economic plan is a new   trillion tax cut  a lot of it going to the very wealthiest americans   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  last week  an independent study  not by me  but by independent economists  said that governor romney's plan would actually raise taxes on middle class families with children by an average of   apiece   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  this wouldn't be done not to reduce the deficit  it's not going to be done to create jobs or put folks back to work rebuilding our roads or bridges or schools  this is you guys paying an extra   to give another   tax cut to folks who are making more than   million a year   i audience members i  no   i the president i  does this sound familiar to you  they have tried to sell us this trickle down theory before  and guess what  every time it's been tried  it has not worked  it did not work then  it won't work now  it won't create jobs  it won't lower our deficit  it is not a plan to move our economy forward  we do not need more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  we need tax relief for working families  you need tax relief  folks who are trying to raise kids and keep them healthy and put a roof over their heads and send them to college  and that's the choice in this election  that's the reason i'm running again  four years ago  i promised to cut middle class taxes  and by the way  that's exactly what i've done  the average working family here in iowa and across the country has seen their tax rates go down about   so when you see when you hear the other side talking about democrats raising your taxes  your taxes are lower since i've been president  that's the truth  now  i want to keep your taxes right where they are for the first   of everybody's income  so if your family makes under  which  by the way  is   percent of americans you won't see your income taxes go up by a single dime next year  ninety seven percent of small businesses will not see their taxes go up  but here's the thing  council bluffs  this is important  if   i audience member i  and omaha   i the president i  and omaha  we love you  didn't want to leave our nebraska folks left out here  but here's the thing  if you're lucky enough and fortunate enough and been blessed enough to be in the other   percent  the top   percent  you still get a tax cut for your first   of income  all we're saying is  after that  maybe you can do a little bit more to help pay down this deficit and invest in things like education that help our economy grow  and listen  government is going to do its part  we've already cut a trillion dollars of savings of spending  we're going to cut more  we've got to streamline government and make it work efficiently and effectively  but what we also can do is just ask folks like me to do a little bit more  and all we're asking is for folks like me to go back to the rates that we paid under bill clinton  and by the way  that was a time when we created nearly   million new jobs  and we created the biggest budget surplus in history  and here's the kicker  folks at the top actually did well because guess what when a factory worker or a construction worker or a receptionist or a teacher or a firefighter or a cop  when they've got a little more money in their pockets  what do they do   i audience members i  spend it   i the president i  maybe they go out and buy a new car  after having been driving that old beater around for the last   years  maybe they finally get the new dishwasher because the old one has been broke for a long time  maybe they go buy a computer for their kid for the new school year or they go to a restaurant or  heaven forbid  they take a vacation  and that means businesses suddenly have more customers  and then businesses start hiring more workers because they're making more profit  and everybody does better  that's how we grow the economy  not from the top down  but from the middle out and from the bottom out  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  you know  across the board  there is a sharp contrast between me and mr  romney  when the auto industry was on the brink of collapse  more than a million jobs at stake  governor romney said   let detroit go bankrupt  i refused to turn my back on one of the great american industries  i bet on american workers  i bet on american manufacturing  three years later  the american auto industry has come roaring back  so now i want to make sure that high tech manufacturing jobs are taking root here  not in china  i want them to take root here in council bluffs  governor romney  he likes to brag about his private sector experience  a bunch of that private sector experience was investing in companies that have been called  pioneers  of outsourcing  let me tell you something  i want insourcing  not outsourcing  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the united states of america  hiring american workers to make american products to sell around the world  stamped with those words  made in america  that's what i believe in  here's another difference  right now homegrown energy  things like wind energy  creating new jobs all across the states like iowa  and governor romney wants to end tax credits for wind energy producers  america now produces twice as much electricity from wind as we did before i took office  we've doubled the amount of electricity we're producing with wind  the wind industry supports about   jobs in iowa  without these wind energy tax credits  a whole lot of these jobs would be at risk  thirty seven thousand jobs across this country would be at risk  so i think we should stop spending billions on taxpayer subsidies for an oil industry that is making all kinds of profits  and let's keep investing in the clean energy that's never been more promising  that's a disagreement i've got with governor romney  that's the choice in this election  back in   i said it was time to end the war in iraq  we ended it  i said it was time for us to go after bin laden and al qaida  and we did  we've set a timeline to start bringing our troops out of afghanistan  and so after a decade of war  i think it's time to do some nation building here at home  now  we could not have accomplished any of this without the extraordinary service of our men and women in uniform  and i promise you this  as long as i am commander in chief  this country will care for our veterans and serve our veterans as well as they've served us  nobody who has fought for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  that's why we've invested so heavily in making sure that the va is working the way it's supposed to  that's why we've put more money into treatment of ptsd and traumatic brain injury  ending homeless among veterans  but those are investments that we've got to make  and my plan says  let's take half the money that we're no longer spending on war  and let's also use it to put people back to work building our roads and our runways and our ports and our wireless networks and creating a veterans job corps so local communities can hire our veterans to be firefighters and police officers in communities that need it  that's the america that we want to build  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term  i want to make sure that america once again leads the world in educating our kids and training our workers  i want to help our schools hire and reward the best teachers  especially in math and science  i want to give   million more americans the chance to go to community college and learn the skills that businesses are hiring for right now  and i want to get colleges and universities to bring down the cost of tuition once and for all because higher education is not a luxury  it's an economic necessity in the  st century  everybody should be able to afford it  i've got a plan to help homeowners refinance their homes at historically low rates  save an average of   my opponent's solution is to  let the market bottom out  that's what he said  that's not a solution  that's part of the problem  that's a difference in this election  my opponent says one of the first things he'd do is repeal obamacare   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i think that part of being middle class in america is making sure you don't go bankrupt when you get sick  that's why  because of this law  if you've got a preexisting condition  you'll be able to get health insurance  that's why   million young people can now stay on their parent's plan  that's why seniors are now getting discounts on their prescription drugs  that's why insurance companies can't drop your coverage or impose lifetime limits when you need it most  it's true  obama does care  that's why we passed this bill  the supreme court has spoken  we're not going backward  we are going forward  all these things whether it's bringing back manufacturing  creating more construction jobs  protecting people's health care  making sure your kids get the best education  making sure our veterans have the same kind of opportunity my grandfather had when he came back from world war ii and was able to go to college on the gi bill all these things are part of what makes up a middle class life  and they're all bound together in that idea that made this country great  that basic promise that if you work hard  you can get ahead  it's not always going to be smooth  there are going to be times where times are tough  but the basic idea that if you work hard and look after your family  that work is going to be rewarded  that's the promise that our parents and grandparents passed down to us  and now it's the promise we've got to pass on to our kids and our grandkids  that's what's at stake in this election  and so  over the next   months  you are going to see the other side spend more money on negative ads than we've ever seen in history  and these folks  they've got some really rich people writing   million checks  and basically  they're going to say the same thing over and over again  they know their economic theories aren't going to sell because folks remember what happened when we tried them  so all they're going to say is the economy is not as good as it should be and it's obama's fault  and they expect you to have amnesia and not remember who it is that got us into the mess  but they figure  if we run these ads often enough  maybe folks will start kind of thinking about it  that is true   i laughter i  so they may have a plan to win the election  but they can't hide the fact that they don't have a plan to create jobs or revive the middle class or grow the economy  and i do have that plan  i've got a plan that puts you first  i've got a plan that puts middle class families and folks striving to get into the middle class first  but i'm going to need your help  i'm going to need your help  i've got to make sure you're registered  i've got to make sure your friends are registered to vote  in iowa  you can get registered online  all you have to do is go on gottaregister com  that's g o t t a   gotta i laughter i gottaregister com  the thing is  we've been outspent before and we've been counted out before  but what you taught me in     was that when the american people cut through all the nonsense  when you focus your attention and you remember the story of your own families and all the struggles your parents and grandparents went through and how maybe because you got a student loan somewhere or maybe because your dad was able to get that job at the factory you guys were able to build a good life together just like michelle and i were able to get opportunities that our parents could have never imagined  when you focus on that thing that is best in america the way we pull together and give everybody a fair shot  and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules and everybody is taking responsibility when you come together and reaffirm those core values that make this the greatest country on earth  you can't be stopped  all the money those folks are spending doesn't matter  you are our democracy  you make decisions about the direction of this country  and  iowa  i've got to tell you  we've come too far to go back now  we've got too many good jobs we still have to create  we've got too many teachers we've still got to hire  we've got too many schools we still have to rebuild  we've got too many students who still need help getting an affordable education  we've got more homegrown energy we've got to generate  we've got more troops we've got to bring home  most of all  we've got more doors of opportunity that we've got to open for everybody who's willing to work hard enough to walk through those doors  that is what is at stake in this election  that is why i am running for president of the united states  that is why i'm asking for your vote  not just for me  but for this country that we believe in  and if you're willing to work with me and stand with me and knock on doors with me and make phone calls with me  if you vote for me in november  we will win iowa  we will win this election  we'll finish what we started in   and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  marshalltown  hello  bobcats  now  i was just told that school  at least for the teachers  starts tomorrow   i laughter i  teachers in the house  so i want to start off by saying thank you to our teachers for the outstanding job that they do each and every day  your principal  your superintendent  your assistant principal  they're all doing a great job  which means  students  you're going to have to hit the books  all right   i laughter i  going to have to hit the books   i audience member i  four more years   i the president i  well  they'll have to hit the books maybe for longer than   more years   i laughter i  we'll be talking about that  a couple of other people i want to acknowledge  first of all  thank kirk for the wonderful introduction  please give him a big round of applause  i want to acknowledge mayor pro tem bethany wirin is here  where's bethany  there she is  right here  and i want to offer my condolences to the family of the mayor who just passed  mayor gene beach  i've got to tell you  it's good to be back in iowa  and it's good to be back in marshalltown  i started in council bluffs  and we are driving to the quads  and we are stopping off a whole bunch of different places  yesterday i got to the state fair and had a pork chop and a beer  it was good  i might have another beer today   i laughter i  just one  just one  but the reason it's so good to be back is because this is really where our movement began  here in iowa  in people's backyards  on family farms and school gyms  on people's porches all across this state  we had a conversation about how we move our country in a direction where everybody has opportunity  where everybody has got a shot  and we know that journey is not done yet  we've still got a lot of work to do  so we are now spending another   days driving through the state  and the reason it's so important is because in some ways this election may be more consequential than the last election  you've got a choice not just between two candidates or two political parties  but between two fundamentally different visions for where we should take our country   i audience member i  you're preaching to the choir   i the president i  it's true  i am   i laughter i  but you're going to have to go then preach to the folks who aren't converted yet  more than any other election  when you go into the voting booth in november  you're going to be making a decision about the kind of america that we have not just for yourselves  but for your children and your grandchildren for decades to come  four years ago  we came together and it wasn't just democrats  we had independents  we had some republicans because we understood that the basic bargain that built this country was at stake  we had gone through a decade where jobs were being shipped overseas  where incomes were going down even while the costs of health care and a college education and groceries were going up  and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  and what we understood then was we had to work hard to get back to that basic bargain  that basic deal that built this country  and it's a very simple promise  it's a promise that says if you work hard in this country  you'll get ahead  if you are responsible  then you can meet your obligations  to yourself  to your family  to your community  you can find a job that pays the bills  you can have a home that you can call your own  you can be assured that you won't go bankrupt if you get sick  you can retire with some dignity and some respect  and most importantly  you can make sure that your kids get the kind of education and opportunities so they can dream even bigger and do even better than you did  that is what the american promise is all about  that's what we've been fighting for  that's what we've been fighting for  and we knew it wasn't going to happen overnight  we knew it was going to take more than one term  maybe even one president  to get this country back to the place where everybody has got a fair shot  but we started  and   years ago  we saved ourselves from going into a great depression  and   million jobs have been created  and half a million manufacturing jobs  and the auto industry got saved  we are now at a point where a lot of folks are still struggling  and so we've got to move forward and not backwards  we've got to move forward  now  the good news is we've got everything we need to succeed  we've still got the best workers in the world  we've still got the best universities and colleges in the world  we've got the best researchers and scientists in the world  we've got the best entrepreneurs  small businessmen and women  and large businesses that are the best in the world  making some of the best products  we've got everything that we need   i audience member i  best president   i the president i  and we're a young nation  we're a young nation  in part because we've got this incredible diversity  people are willing to come here from all corners of the globe because they understand there's something special about this place  and so for all the naysayers out there and the folks who try to paint things as dark as they can  especially during election time  the fact of the matter is there's no nation on earth that wouldn't trade places with us  so we've got the tools to make sure that we are living up to this country's promise  a country where you can make it if you try  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what faith you are  no matter what race you are  no matter what your last name is  here in america  you can make it  that's what we have the opportunity to make sure continues for the next generation  that's what we're fighting for  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  now  there is one thing holding back  though  and that is the politics in washington  we've got the other side has decided that compromise is a dirty word  and they spend a lot of time trying to beat me instead of moving the country forward  but part of it is just an honest disagreement about how we move the country forward  governor romney chose a running mate this weekend  and i know congressman ryan  he's a good man  he's a good family man  but he's got a fundamentally different view about how we move this country forward  he's an articulate spokesperson for governor romney's views  he's the ideological leader of the republicans in congress  but that vision is wrong  look  let me tell you  you can sum up governor romney's plans pretty simply  he wants to eliminate   i audience member i  everything   i laughter i   i the president i   regulation  he wants to eliminate regulations on big banks and corporations  some of which we put in place in the wake of the disaster on wall street  and he wants to institute even more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  the centerpiece of his plan is a new   trillion tax cut  a lot of it which would go to folks like me who don't need it  and here's the kicker  he expects all of you to pick up the tab   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  no  don't take my word for it  independent analysis shows that if his plan was instituted  the only way you could pay for it would be to have the average middle class family with children pay an extra   in taxes  how many people think that's a good idea   i audience members i  no   i the president i  how many people think that would actually grow the economy   i audience members i  no   i the president i  but that's his theory  the theory is  is that if folks up here are doing really well  then all the benefits are going to trickle down  the extra   you'd be paying wouldn't be used to pay down the deficit or the debt that we've already got  it wouldn't be to invest in more teachers or a better school system or making college more affordable or rebuilding our roads and bridges and finding new ways to create cheap energy  no  this   would be to help finance an average   tax break for folks making   million a year or more   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i got to tell you  we have heard this sales pitch from these folks before  we've heard this trickle down fairy dust before  it didn't work then  it will not work now  we don't think it's a plan to reduce the deficit  it's certainly not a plan to create jobs and to help families right now  see  i believe in a different theory  when it comes to taxes  i said in   i was going to lower middle class taxes  and guess what  i did  so the average family the typical family is paying   less in taxes than they were when i came into office  so what i believe now is i want to keep your income taxes right where they are for everybody making   or less which is   percent of americans    percent of small businesses  and folks who are in the other   percent  who are fortunate enough to be in the top   percent  they still get a tax cut for the first   but after that  we're asking them to pay a little bit more so we can finance things like education and reduce our deficit in a balanced  responsible way  now  i still want to make sure that government does its part by being good stewards of taxpayer dollars  so we've cut a trillion dollars out of federal spending  a trillion dollars that i've already signed into law  we've got an additional trillion that's slated  so we're prepared to make some tough choices on things we can't afford  but we're not going to reduce the deficit by gutting education investments  gutting investments that we make in our infrastructure  gutting our investments in basic science and research that can lead to discoveries in clean energy or lead to discoveries in curing cancer  that's not how we're going to grow this economy and make sure that the middle class is strong  and by the way  when i say asking folks like me to do a little bit more  we've tried that before too  under bill clinton  and we created   million new jobs  went from a deficit to a surplus  and guess what  marshalltown  here's the thing it actually was good for rich people  too  because what happens is  look  when a teacher or a construction worker or a receptionist or a nurse  when they've got a little more money in their pocket  what do they do   i audience members i  spend it   i the president i  they spend it on necessities  and so maybe you've got a  year old car  and you go out and buy a new one  or maybe you need a new appliance  and you go out  and you get a new appliance  or maybe you buy a computer for your kid as they're going off to college  and suddenly  business has more customers  and those businesses get more profits  and they hire more workers  we don't believe in top down economics  the history of this country has been a middle class out economics  a bottom up economics  when everybody is doing well  when everybody has opportunity  then we all succeed and the country moves forward  that's what's at stake in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  you see the difference in philosophies on almost every issue  when the automakers were on the brink of collapse  a million jobs at stake  governor romney said let's let detroit go bankrupt  i said let's bet on american workers  and   years later  the american auto industry has come roaring back  so we know american manufacturing can succeed in this country high tech manufacturing  advanced manufacturing but we've got to make sure we've got a tax code that encourages it  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the united states of america  hiring american workers  making american products  governor romney has got a different view  he talks about how he has been in the private sector  so he knows how to put folks back to work  but it turns out most of his business was investing on behalf of folks like him and investing in some cases in what has been called  pioneers  of outsourcing  we don't need pioneers of outsourcing  we need folks who are interested in insourcing and bringing some jobs back to marshalltown  back to iowa  and back to the united states of america  let me give you another example  kirk was just talking about wind power  i was just visiting a wind farm close by  it's a working farm  it has about five windmills on one property    in this area  wind farms generating incredible amounts of energy and  by the way  helping family farmers with a little bit of extra income  now  governor romney has decided that we should end the tax credit that we provide for wind power once and for all  that's his idea  he wants to get rid of it  at a moment when homegrown energy is creating new jobs here in states like iowa  he wants to bring an end to it  he said and i'm quoting here he said new sources of energy like these are  imaginary   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  his running mate  congressman ryan  calls them a  fad  then during a speech a few months ago  governor romney explained his energy policy this way   you can't drive a car with a windmill on it  that's what he said about wind power  now  i know he's tried some other things on top of a car   i laughter i  i didn't know he had tried windmills on top of a car  but maybe he tried it  i would have liked to have seen that   i laughter i  but maybe he needs to come to iowa to learn something about wind power  he'd know if he came here that   jobs have been created here in iowa by the wind industry  more than any other state in america  these jobs aren't a fad  they're the future  and we've got to be investing in them  if he came to iowa  he might know that not only are we putting up these windmills  but increasingly  they're made right here in iowa  made here in america  that's not imaginary  that's real  if he came here to iowa  he might know that   percent of iowa's electricity now comes from wind energy  over the past   years  america has doubled its the amount of electricity that is produced from wind  and this is enough to power   million homes with clean and renewable energy  think about that  it's the equivalent of   hoover dams worth of electricity is being generated by wind power in this country  that's something that's worth investing in  that's something we're doing for the next generation  and so are the   american jobs that are on the line if we let this wind tax credit expire  so this is a difference between me and governor romney  i want to stop giving   billion in taxpayer subsidies every single year to the oil companies that are doing just great  and let's take some of that money and continue to invest in homegrown  renewable energy right here in iowa and all across america that can put people back to work  i'll give you another example of a difference  i said in   i'd end the war in iraq  and i did  i said we'd refocus and go after al qaida and bin laden we did  we're bringing our troops home from afghanistan  all this is possible because of the extraordinary service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform  so we've made some historic investments in the va  my attitude is anybody who has fought for america  they shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  we've got to serve them as well as they serve us  but we also need to make sure that folks coming home  they're coming back to a vibrant economy  so what i've said is let's take half of the money that we're saving after a decade of war and let's put people back to work  let's create a veterans jobs corps that can hire police officers and firefighters in communities that need them  let's get a whole bunch of construction workers to rebuild our roads and our bridges  our ports and our airports  let's rebuild our schools  let's lay broadband lines into rural communities  those investments are good now because they put people back to work  and that means folks have got more money in their pockets  and what do they do when they've got more money in their pockets   i audience members i  spend it   i the president i  they spend it  and suddenly  businesses have more customers  but it's also good for the long run  because if we've got the best roads  the best bridges  the best airports  the fastest broadband lines  the best wireless networks  the best transmission lines  all that makes us more productive  and it means our economy is going to grow in the future  so why wouldn't we start now  that's what we need to be investing in  so look  one more difference  when it comes to education  i believe that nothing is more important than making our kids competitive in the  st century economy  our young people  they're not just competing against folks in north carolina or new hampshire  they're now competing against folks in india and china  so i want to make sure that we're helping school districts hire and retain the best teachers  especially in math and science  i want to make sure that we're creating   million more slots in community colleges so folks can get trained in the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  and i want to make college more affordable for young people  we have already made progress on this front  and i'm not just talking about  year colleges  i'm talking about  year community colleges  getting advanced training  but the point is that some form of higher education  it is no longer a luxury  it is an economic necessity in the  st century  and i want to make sure every young person in america and every young person in marshalltown can take advantage of those opportunities  that's part of what this election is all about  governor romney wants to repeal obamacare   i audience members i  no   i the president i  first of all  i don't mind the term obamacare  i like it  because i do care  that's why we passed the bill   i audience member i  yes   i the president i  and because of it    million young people can stay on their parent's plan  because of it  we've got millions of seniors out there who are seeing more discounts on their prescription drugs and we're closing the doughnut hole  because of what we're doing  more people are getting preventive care  because of what we're doing  insurance companies can't drop you right when you need insurance most just because of some fine print  so maybe governor romney wants to spend the next   years rearguing what we've been arguing about for the last   years  but the supreme court has spoken  we are implementing this law  we are moving forward  we are not going backwards  that is a choice in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term as president  we're not going to undo the reforms we've put into place to make sure wall street doesn't ask for another taxpayer funded bailout  we're not going to go back to the days when folks  to serve this country  it depended on who they loved  if they love this country  they should be able to serve this country  period  we're going to make sure that young people who are brought to this country when they were very young and have grown up as americans  that they have an opportunity to contribute here in america  the country that they love  we're not going backwards  we're going forward  now  i have to tell you that over the course of the next   months  though  you will see more money spent by the other side than we've ever seen in history  and i don't want to lie  i mean  we're raising money  but these folks are writing   million checks  i mean  they've got some friends in with a lot of money  and we are seeing all these ads  and you notice they don't really have a plan  i mean  you don't see these ads saying what they're going to do  because they know that their plan would not sell  so instead  what they're going to do is just repeat over and over again the same things that they've been saying for the last   years  and that is  the economy is not doing as well as it should and it's obama's fault  i mean  that's their  basically  they'll do different ads  but it's the same theme  and you know  i might be a little worried about it except  what you taught me  iowa  in   we have been outspent before  we have been counted out before  but what i've learned is that when the american people cut through the nonsense  when they're paying attention and they're focused  and they think back to their own families and their parents and their grandparents and everything that's made this country great  when they decide we're going to make sure that we've got a government that is not just representing the powerful and the wealthy  but just looking after ordinary folks and recognizing government can't solve every problem and nobody expects a handout or a bailout  but we do expect to make sure that together we are doing things that help the next generation  when the american people start focusing on those core values that have made this country great  i tell you what  you can't be stopped  you can't be stopped  you're the most powerful force in this democracy  so  marshalltown  i'm going to need your help  i'm going to need you fired up again  i'm going to need you ready to go  we're going to have to make sure everybody is registered  if you're not registered  by the way  you can get forms online  going to gottaregister com   i laughter i  that's g o t t a  i'm sorry  teachers  but it's  gotta   i laughter i  it's not  got to  it's  gotta  gottaregister com  but if you guys are ready to work  we'll get this done  because we've got more work to do  we've got more schools to build  we've got more teachers to hire  we've got more troops to bring home  we've got more roads to build  we've got more opportunity to create for our young people to make college more affordable  we've got a lot of unfinished business  and i tell you what  back in   i used to say to folks  look  i'm not a perfect man you can ask michelle   i laughter i  and i tell folks  i'm not i won't be a perfect president  nobody is  but what i did say is i'll wake up every single day fighting as hard as i know how for you  that i will think about you  and i will represent you  and i will fight for you  and i have kept that promise  iowa  i have kept that promise  so if you're willing to stand with me and work with me and organize with me and knock on some doors and make some phone calls with me  we will finish what we started  we will get folks back to work  we will revive the middle class dream of america  and we will remind the world why this is the greatest nation on earth  thank you  everybody  god bless you  god bless america  thank you "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  iowa  it is good to be back in oskaloosa  it is good to see all of you  if you've got a chair  please feel free to take a seat  i want everybody to feel relaxed out here  it's a beautiful summer day  i've been talking to some kids  i guess school starts up in a couple of days  so they were looking a little depressed   i laughter i  but it's okay  school is going to be great  i know you guys have had a great summer  before i start  i just want to acknowledge an outstanding member of congress who's fighting every day on behalf of the people of his district  dave loebsack is here  give dave a big round of applause  there he is  thank you  dave  it has been great to be back in iowa  back in     i was on your farms and in your backyards and on your porches  and that's where our movement for change really began  right here in iowa  and we spent a lot of time on bus tours like this one all across the state  and it was good also to be back at the iowa state fair  although when i was just a candidate  they let me go on the bumper cars   i laughter i  and i went up on the big ben  do you guys been ever been on that  where they just shoot you up about   feet in the air  i was with malia  and i started screaming  and she looked at me  saying  come on  dad  get it under control   i laughter i  but it was terrifying  anyway  secret service does not let me do that anymore  but i was still able to get a beer and a pork chop  so i was pretty happy about that  i was pretty happy about that  here's the thing  i'm back because our journey is not yet done  we're spending   days driving all the way across the state  just like we did in     we're going for from council bluffs all the way to the quads  quad cities  because once again you face a critical choice in november  in some ways  this is even more important an election than   because this choice could not be bigger  it's not just a choice between two candidates  it's not just a choice between two political parties  it is a choice between two fundamentally different visions of how america became great and how it's going to stay great  two fundamentally different visions of the path we need to take for the future of our kids and our grandkids  and the direction that you choose when you walk into the voting booth in november  it's going to determine not just our lives next year or   years from now  it's going to determine the future for decades to come for our kids and our grandchildren  four years ago  when we came together and it wasn't just democrats  by the way  we had independents  and we had some republicans we came together because a lot of us realized that the core idea  the basic bargain that made this country was under threat  and it's a basic bargain that says if you work hard in this country  you can get ahead  that if you take responsibility  then you can make it  that you can get into the middle class  you can feel a sense of security  that you can find a job that pays the bills and have a home you call your own  that you won't go bankrupt when you get sick  that you can retire with dignity and respect  and most importantly  that you can give your kids a great education and they can do even better and dream even bigger than you ever imagined  that's the american promise  that's the american dream  that's what we've been fighting for  now  we knew restoring that basic idea wouldn't be easy  because we had just gone through a decade in which that bargain  that promise wasn't being kept  jobs had gotten shipped overseas  people were working harder but making less  while the cost of everything from health care to college was going up  we fought two wars on a credit card  adding enormously to our debt  and all this culminated then in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  and so we knew this wasn't going to be easy  and when the crisis hit in   and   millions of people all across this country some of our friends and neighbors and family members lost their jobs  lost their homes  lost their savings  and that made the american dream even a little bit further out of reach  now  i told you when i ran the first time that this was not going to be easy  restoring that bargain  that there weren't any quick fixes to our solutions  but what i also insisted  and what i still believe  is we've got everything we need to solve these challenges  we have everything we need right here in america to make the middle class strong again  we've got the best workers in the world  we've got the best entrepreneurs in the world  everybody knows we got the best farms in the world  we've got the best scientists  the best researchers  we've got the best universities  we've got the best colleges  we are a young nation still  partly because we're still a magnet for talent from all around the world  we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity of any other country  and so even though there are some people who like to talk about american decline or they try to paint things as dark as possible especially during election season there is no doubt in my mind that there's not another country on earth that wouldn't gladly trade places with us  we've got everything we need to succeed  and most of all  what we've got is the american character  i've seen it over the last   years  i see it in folks who lose their jobs at the age of   or   and they go back to a community college  studying hard  sitting next to  year olds  and retrain  and suddenly  they go back  and they get a job in a new industry  or the small business owner who could barely keep their doors open but decided  you know what  i'm not going to take a salary  i'm not going to take any pay  because i want to make sure my workers are taken care of because they've got families to support  all across america  it turns out americans are tougher than any tough times  we are resilient  and we work hard  and we may get knocked down but we always get back up  that has been the character of america  and that character has not changed  and it's because of that character that over the last   years we've made some progress  we're not all the way back to where we need to be  but we've created   million new jobs  half a million new jobs in manufacturing  we have seen small businesses start to open back up  we've seen workers getting retrained and getting rehired  and so we've made progress  but our goal in     wasn't just getting back to where we were before the crisis  our goal was to make sure that we built an economy that lasts  where we built an economy where middle class folks and folks aspiring to the middle class can succeed  that has been our goal  that's what we're still fighting for  we are not yet done  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  because we've got more work to do  now  i said we've got everything we need to solve our problems  the main impediment we've got  the main roadblock we've got is politics in washington  you've got another party that thinks compromise is a dirty word and that believes the only way we can move forward is to go back to the same top down economics that got us into this mess in the first place   i audience member i  yeah  you're right   i the president i  now  you may have heard that governor romney just chose his running mate  congressman ryan  and   i audience member i  boo   i the president i  he's a good man  he's a family man  he's the ideological leader of the republicans in congress  and he's an articulate spokesperson for governor romney's views  the problem is those views are wrong  i fundamentally disagree with their vision for america  their basic prescription for america is to get rid of more regulations on big banks and big corporations  give more tax breaks to the very wealthiest americans  and their belief is somehow that prosperity then will trickle down on everybody else  that's their view  look  the centerpiece of governor romney's entire economic plan the centerpiece of it  his main idea  his one big idea is to give another   trillion tax cut on top of the bush tax cuts that he's keeping in he wants to keep in place  five trillion dollars  to give you some sense of perspective  our entire defense budget is about half a trillion dollars a year  so this tax cut would be the equivalent of what we spend on the national defense every single year for the next   years  trillion  last week  we found out that he expects you to pay the tab  governor romney's tax plan would actually raise taxes on middle class families with children by an average of   to pay for this big tax break that's going mostly to the wealthiest folks   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  understand  this is not asking you to pay more taxes to reduce our deficit or to help kids get an education or to rebuild some roads and bridges and ports around the country  this is asking you to pay more to give an average   tax break to folks making   million a year or more  that is his big idea  now  they have tried to sell this kind of trickle down fairy dust before   i laughter i  and frankly  they tried it as recently as       and what did we get  the most sluggish job growth in generations  incomes and wages going down  jobs going overseas  and a huge economic crisis  and  by the way  the deficits kept on going up  so by the time i walked into office  we had a trillion dollar deficit  why would we want to try that again  i don't know about you  but my general rule is  if i do something and it doesn't work  and then i do it again and it doesn't work again  i stop doing it   i laughter i  i stop doing it  i try something else  so they don't have a plan to cut the deficit  they don't have a plan to create jobs  they sure don't have a plan to revive the middle class  we don't need more tax cuts for folks like me  folks who are doing fine  we need tax relief for working americans  so when i came into office  i had promised you that i would cut taxes for middle class americans  and guess what  i kept that promise  the republicans like to call democrats the big tax and spend folks  but it turns out that your tax rates are lower by about   for the typical family than they were when i came into office because i kept my promise  so now what i want to do is to keep your income tax rates exactly where they are  i don't want your taxes going up for the first   of income that you make which  by the way  covers about   percent of all americans and   percent of all small businesses  your taxes your income taxes would not go up one single dime next year if congress does what i've asked them to do  what i have said is  for those who are fortunate enough to be in the other   percent  you'd still get a tax cut for the first   you make  but after that we're asking you to pay a little bit more to help pay down the deficit and help to invest in making college affordable for young people and making sure that we've got teachers on the job and making sure that we're investing in science to help cure cancer and alzheimer's  that is how that's how our economy can grow  that's how our economy will grow  we're going to make sure government does its part  a lot of people don't realize we've already cut a trillion dollars of government spending to lower our deficit a trillion dollars  and we can do more  i think government has to make sure that it's good stewards for your taxpayer dollars  that it's not being wasted  and there's still more waste that we can get out of there  but we can't close the deficit and invest in our future just by cutting taxes for the wealthiest americans  cutting education  cutting the things that help us grow  and by the way  the proposal that i'm putting forward that says folks like me and governor romney have to pay a little bit more we actually have tried that  too  we tried it under bill clinton  when we created   million new jobs  the biggest budget surplus in history  and guess what  folks at the top  they did good too  and the reason is  when you give a family farmer or you give a construction worker or you give a receptionist or you give a nurse or a teacher a little bit more money in their pockets  what do they do   i audience member i  spend it   i the president i  they spend it  maybe they finally trade in that  year old car and get a new car  maybe they get a new appliance because the dishwasher's or the washing machine's broken  maybe they buy a new computer for their kids who are about to go to college  maybe they go to a restaurant or  heaven forbid  take a vacation once in a while  and what that means is then businesses have more customers and businesses hire more workers and everybody does better  you get what's called a virtuous cycle of everybody feeling more confident about the economy because everybody has got a stake in the economy  see  i don't believe in an economy from the top down  i believe that the economy grows from the middle class out and from the bottom up  and when everybody is doing well and everybody's got a fair shot  everybody ends up doing better  that's how we grow this economy  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  so there's there are differences in this election on almost every issue  when the automakers were on the brink of collapse  governor romney said   let detroit go bankrupt  i said  let's bet on american workers  and   years later  the auto industry has come roaring back  so now i want to make sure that american manufacturing  advanced high tech manufacturing  is taking root right here in america not in china  not in germany  right here in iowa  right here in oskaloosa  right here in the united states of america   i audience member i  oskaloosa   i the president i  you know  governor romney  he likes to brag about his private sector experience  his main private sector experience he did make a lot of money was investing in companies  some of which were called  pioneers  of outsourcing  i don't want a pioneer of outsourcing  i want somebody who is fighting for insourcing  i want to bring business back to america  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give them to companies that are investing right here in iowa and right here in the united states of america  hiring american workers  making american products that we're selling around the world stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's what i believe in  that's why i'm running  let me give you another example  we're at a moment right now when homegrown energy  like wind energy  is creating new jobs all across iowa and all across the country  and guess what  governor romney said let's end the tax credits for wind energy production  let's get rid of them  he said that new sources of energy like wind are  imaginary  his running mate calls them a  fad  during a speech a few months ago  governor romney even explained his energy policy this way i'm quoting here   you can't drive a car with a windmill on it   i laughter i  that's what he said about wind power   you can't drive a car with a windmill on it  now  i don't know if he's actually tried that  i know he's had other things on his car   i laughter i  but if he wants to learn something about wind  all he's got to do is pay attention to what you've been doing here in iowa  if he saw what you've been doing  he'd see that there are places like newton  where a few years ago the maytag plant closed down  jobs dried up  folks are now back to work manufacturing these enormous new towers and blades for some of the most sophisticated  high tech wind turbines on the planet  the wind industry now supports   jobs here in iowa    jobs across the country  these jobs aren't a  fad  these are good jobs  and they're a source of pride that we need to fight for  and if he if governor romney understood what you've been doing  he'd know that we used to have to import most of the parts that were used for wind turbines  they're now being made here in america  by american workers in american factories  that's not  imaginary  that's real  that's part of what we're fighting for in this election  if he knew what you've been doing  he'd know that   percent of iowa's electricity now comes from wind  powering our homes and our factories and our businesses in a way that is clean and renewable  in fact  over the past   years  we've doubled the amount of electricity america generates for wind  across america  we've built the equivalent of   new hoover dams' worth of wind energy  think about that  think about that  so governor romney may have figured out that you can't drive a car with a windmill on it  but he doesn't seem to know that america now has enough wind turbines installed to generate enough electricity from wind to power nearly   million homes with clean energy  that's how we leave something better for the next generation  that's worth fighting for  that's what's at stake right now  so i want to stop giving   billion in taxpayer subsidies that are going to oil companies that are making huge profits and have been subsidized for a hundred years  and let's keep on investing in the new homegrown energy that's creating jobs right here in iowa  that's a difference in this election  that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  we've got a whole lot of differences between me and governor romney   i audience member i  you're better  you are better   i the president i  you know   i audience member i  you are better   i the president   i i got to say  i agree with that   i laughter i  my ideas are  at least   i audience member i  you are the man   i the president i  the look  in   i said we'd end the war in iraq  we did  we said that we'd go after al qaida and bin laden  we did  we are now bringing troops home from afghanistan  america is safer and more secure than when i came into office because of the extraordinary sacrifices of our men and women in uniform  that's why we've invested so much in making sure that the va is doing its job  making sure that our veterans get the benefits that they have earned  because they shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads after they've fought for us  we've got to serve them as well as they've served us  but as they're now coming home  i want to take about half the money that we're saving after a decade of war and let's help put veterans and americans back to work rebuilding america  doing some nation building here at home  let's rebuild our ports and our roads and our bridges and our airports  we can put folks back to work right now  it's good for the economy now  it'll be good for the economy   years from now and   years from now  we i want to set up a veterans jobs corps that helps local communities hire veterans for firefighters and cops in communities that need them most  those are smart investments in the future  governor romney may have a different idea  i want to put folks back to work rebuilding america  and now is the time to do it  his other idea is  let's get it rid of obamacare  he says  i'm going to  kill it  well  let me tell you something  it's true  i do care  so i don't mind folks calling it obamacare  and what i've said is that in a country as rich as ours  we should not see anybody going bankrupt when they get sick  the supreme court has now spoken  we are moving forward with this law  six and a half million young people can now stay on their parent's plan  insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition  insurance companies can't drop your coverage when you need it the most  for a lot of rural communities  a lot of farmers  it's hard buying health insurance on your own  you're now going to be able to pool with other folks so you can get discounted rates just like people who work for big companies  that will help a lot of communities all across iowa  so we're not going to go backwards and refight the same fights we had over the last   years  we're going forward  we're not going backwards  we don't need to have those same arguments in washington  what we need to do is go ahead and implement this law and make sure it works  and if anybody has got good ideas to help further lower health care costs  i'm happy to work with them  but we're not going backwards  we're going forwards  that's what america needs right now  i'm running to make sure that we've got the best education system in the world  i want to help local communities hire the best teachers  especially in math and science  give   million more slots available in community colleges so people can get trained for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  and i want to make college more affordable for every single young person in america  we've already done a lot of work making sure that they're getting help  but i'm also going to work with the colleges and universities to lower tuition once and for all  because a higher education is not a luxury in this economy  it is an economic necessity  and i want to make sure opportunities are open for everybody  not just for the few  all these issues bringing manufacturing back  helping young people go to school  giving you more health care security all these issues tie together  it goes back to what made this country great  when i think about my own life  when i think about michelle's life  we didn't come from wealth  we didn't come from fame  but we were lucky enough to be born in a country where here  everybody gets a fair shot  everybody does their fair share  everybody plays by the same set of rules  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your last name is  you can make it here if you try  that's the story of america  that's your story  your parents  your grandparents  your great grandparents  they went through struggles  they went through hardship  nothing was given to them  but they did live in a country where you had a shot  and we now have an obligation to pass that on to the next generation  that's what we have to fight for  and over the next   months  you're going to see more tv advertising than you've ever seen in your life  and these folks are spending more money they've got people writing   million checks  and almost all the ads are the same  they basically say  the economy is not where it needs to be  and it's obama's fault  they just kind of repeat that over and over and over again   i audience member i  and it's not   i the president i  well  you know what  let me tell you something  that may be a plan to win an election  but it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to make our future better  it's not a plan to revive the middle class  they don't have that plan  i do have that plan  i do have that plan  but i'm going to need your help  i'm going to need everybody here registering to vote  i'm going to need you to get your friends and neighbors to register to vote  you can get forms online  you can go to gottaregister com that's  gotta  g o t t a   i laughter i  but what i learned from you here in iowa in   is other folks may outspend me  folks may write me off  but when you've got ordinary folks pulling together  cutting through the nonsense  and focuses on what's important when you guys get involved you can't be stopped  nothing can stop you  you will decide the future of this country  and i'm asking for your help  because we've got more schools to build  we got more teachers to hire  we've got more troops who have got to come home  we've got more manufacturing plants that we've got to build  we've got more americans we need to put back to work  and we've got more doors of opportunity that we have to open for all americans  and if you're willing to stand with me and work with me and make phone calls with me and knock on some doors with me  then we can finish what we started in   we can make this middle class strong again  we can make sure that the future is bright for our kids again  and we can remind the world just why it is the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america  thank you "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  waterloo  what a beautiful evening here in iowa  this is   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  this is spectacular  it feels good to be back  a couple of acknowledgments that i want to make  first of all  mike is a pretty humble guy  but this is the iowa firefighter of the year  give him a big round of applause for that great introduction  we are proud of him and every single firefighter that puts their lives at risk for us  we are grateful to them  a couple other outstanding folks here  you've got your own attorney general  tom miller  in the house  congressman bruce braley is here  and mayor buck clark is here  and all of you are here  now listen  if you've got a seat  feel free to sit down because i've got some things to say  i've got some things to say  first of all  it is good to be back  some of you may remember that one of my first stops after i announced for the presidency was right here in waterloo back  way back when  in   i had no gray hair  maybe i had a little bit  but you couldn't see it  now you can see it   i laughter i  but the reason that's important it's worth reminding people is because it was on your front porches  it was in your backyards  where our movement for change began  we spent a lot of time on bus tours like the one i'm taking right now  although the bus wasn't as nice as it is now   i laughter i  and we went to school gyms and family farms and small businesses across the state  and so it was pretty good being back here  yesterday i went to the state fair  and i had a pork chop and a beer  and it was good  today i just had a beer   i laughter i  i didn't get the pork chop  but the beer was good too   i audience member i  i'll fry you a pork chop   i the president i  you say  you'll fry me a pork chop  huh   i laughter i   i audience member i  four more beers   i the president i  somebody just said it's true  at the state fair  instead of saying   more years  they were saying   four more beers  so i bought him four more beers   i laughter i  told him he had to register to vote  though  to get one of the beers  now  here's the thing  it is the reason i'm back  other than i just love being in iowa  the reason i'm back is because that journey we started in   we're not finished yet  so just like we did in   we started over in council bluffs  and we are driving all the way to the quads  and we want to make sure that everybody understands the choice that you face in november  and this choice could not be bigger  because it's not just a choice between two candidates  it's not just a choice between two parties  more than any recent election  more than   this is a choice between two fundamentally different visions of where we need to go as a country  and the direction that you choose when you walk into that voting booth in november  that's going to have an impact not just on your lives  it will have an impact on your children and your grandchildren for decades to come  now  remember why we came together in   and it was democrats and independents  but it was also some republicans  it was because we saw that the basic bargain that built this country  that created the most prosperous economy the world has ever known  that basic bargain wasn't being met  and let me tell you what that bargain is  it says that if you work hard  your work should be rewarded  it says that if you act responsibly and you put in enough effort  you can find a job that pays the bills  you can have a home that you call your own  you won't go broke just because somebody in your family gets sick  you can retire with dignity and respect  and most importantly  you can give your kids a great education so they can dream even bigger and do even better than you did  that is the american promise  that is what made this country great  but the problem was for a decade we had seen that bargain wasn't being met  the promise wasn't being kept  so we had seen a decade in which jobs were being shipped overseas and wages and incomes for working people were going down  even though folks at the very top were doing very well  and the costs of everything from health care to college were going up  we ran two wars on a credit card  we went from surplus to deficit  so when i walked into office we already had a   trillion deficit  and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  that's the track record of the other party the last time they were in charge  and we knew that restoring the bargain that made this country great would not be easy  it was going to take more than one year or one term or even more than one president  but we knew we had to get started  and obviously it became that much harder when the middle class was hammered by this crisis because a lot of folks lost jobs  lost homes  lost savings  and that american dream seemed even further out of reach  but i told you there wouldn't be any quick fixes  there wouldn't be any easy solutions  but what i also promised you  and i absolutely believe this  is we've got everything we need to meet our challenges  waterloo  we've still got the best workers in the world and the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best scientists and the best researchers in the world  we've got the best farmers in the world  we've got the best colleges and universities in the world  we are still a young nation  full of promise  and we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity from every corner of the globe  so no matter what the naysayers say  no matter how dark they try to paint things when they're running against me in an election  there is not another country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states of america  because people around the world still believe that america is the place where  if you work hard  no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  you can still make it  that's the idea that we are running to rebuild  that is the campaign  that is what my presidency is about  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  waterloo  what is there is one thing standing in our way  though  is that is strange politics in washington  you've got a party that says compromise is a dirty word  folks who want to go back to the same top down economics that got us into this mess in the first place  you may have heard  my opponent chose as his running mate congressman ryan this weekend and   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  no  no listen  i know congressman ryan  he is a decent man  he is a family man  he is the ideological leader of the republicans in congress  and he's an articulate spokesperson for governor romney's vision  the problem is  his vision is wrong  see  my opponent  governor romney  and his friends in congress  they believe this is their whole platform  this is their basic plan  as much detail as you get  this is what you get  their plan to grow the economy is to eliminate regulations  including on big banks and insurance companies  some of the regulations we put in place to make sure  for example  that we don't have another taxpayer funded bailout  so he wants to get rid of regulations  and then what he wants to do is give more tax breaks to the wealthiest americans  and the idea  then  is that jobs and prosperity will trickle down on everybody  that's the centerpiece of his plan  you can go on his web site  his economic plan is a new   trillion tax cut  a lot of it going to the wealthiest americans  now  keep in mind  these are the same folks who say the deficit is our biggest problem  but they want to pass a new   trillion tax cut  trillion  that's with a  t   i laughter i  so just to give you some perspective  our annual defense budget  everything we spend on national security  is just a little over   billion  so this would be  every year for   years  a tax cut as big as our defense spending  and here's the kicker  though  he says he's going to pay for it  so people asked  well  how are you going to pay for it  it turns out that he expects you to pay for it   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  he expects middle class families to pick up the tab  governor romney's plan  according to independent analysts  would actually raise taxes on middle class families with children by an average of    i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  keep in mind  this is not   to reduce the deficit or create jobs or build new schools or help kids go to college or send a man to the moon  this is   each that you'd have to pay to give another   tax cut to folks who are making   million a year or more   i audience members i  boo   i audience member i  that's crazy   i laughter i   i the president i  now  i'm not making this stuff up  you can look  look on their web site  now  here's the thing  we've tried this before  we tried this trickle down fairy dust before  and guess what  it didn't work then  it won't work now  it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to lower the deficit  it's not a plan to move our economy forward  it's not a plan to revive the middle class  we do not need more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  we need to give tax relief to working families who are trying to raise their kids  keep them healthy  send them to college  keep a roof over their heads  that's the choice in this election  that's one of the reasons i'm running for a second term as president  so  waterloo  i've got a different idea  four years ago  i came into office  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  that's exactly what i've done  by a total of about   for the typical family  so if you talk to somebody who is still not convinced and undecided in the election  you tell them your taxes are lower  your federal taxes are lower now than when i came into office  now  what i want to do is i want to keep everybody's taxes right there where they are for the first   of everybody's income  so if your family makes under  like   percent of families do  and   percent of small businesses do then you won't see your income taxes go up by a single dime next year not one dime  but  but  if you're fortunate enough to be in the other   percent  like i am  you'll still get a tax break on your first   but for the amount that you make over that  we're asking you to contribute a little bit more so we can pay down our deficit without gutting education  without getting rid of transportation projects  without gutting all the things that help make america grow  now  government i'll make sure government still does its part to reduce our debt and our deficits  we've cut out already a trillion dollars' worth of spending we don't need  and we can do more  i want to make government efficient  we've got to make sure that your tax dollars are being well spent  but we can't bring down our deficit and our debt just by asking us to get rid of the things that help open up opportunity to americans  so instead  we're asking folks like me to go back to the rates we paid under bill clinton  which  by the way  was a time when we created   million new jobs  went from deficit to surplus  and we created a whole lot of millionaires to boot  see  waterloo  this comes down to your basic philosophy  but also  when you look at the evidence of our economic history when teachers and nurses and firefighters and receptionists and construction workers when you've got a little more money in your pocket  what do you do  you spend it because times are tight  right  so if you've got a little extra money  now maybe you finally trade in that  year old car you've been driving  maybe you buy a computer for your kid who is about to go to college  so suddenly businesses have more customers  which means they're making more profits  which means they're hiring more workers  who then spend more money  and suddenly the economy gets better for everybody  including folks at the top  i don't believe in top down economics  i believe in middle class out economics  i believe in bottom up economics  i believe in making sure everybody has got a fair shot  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  but you know what  that's not the only difference between me and mr  romney  when the auto industry was on the brink of collapse do you remember that more than a million jobs at stake  governor romney said  let's let detroit go bankrupt  i said  let's bet on american workers  and management and workers got together in a great  iconic american industry  and you know what  three years later  the american auto industry is roaring back  i want to see high tech advanced manufacturing come back all across america in other industries  i don't want those jobs in china or germany  i want them here in iowa  governor romney says  well  no  look  i understand the economy because i've been in the private sector  well  a lot of that experience was investing in companies  including those that were called  pioneers' in the business of outsourcing  he wants to keep giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  i want to end those tax breaks once and for all and start rewarding companies that are investing right here in the united states of america  hiring american workers  making american products  that's the choice in this election  that's not the only difference  right now  we're seeing homegrown energy  new sources of energy  creating jobs right here in iowa  so what does governor romney want to do  he wants to end the tax credit for wind energy producers  he said these new sources of energy are  imaginary  congressman ryan  his running mate  calls them a  fad  during a speech a few months ago  governor romney even explained his energy policy  this is what he said  he said   you can't drive a car with a windmill on it   i laughter i  that's what he said about wind power  you can't drive a car with a windmill on it  i mean  maybe he's tried it  he's put other things on the roof   i laughter i  but if he really wants to learn something about wind energy  he should come to iowa  then he'd know that   iowa jobs depend on the wind industry  more than any other state in america  these jobs aren't a fad  they're our future  he'd know that the parts for making these high tech wind turbines  they're now made in iowa  they're made in america  that's not imaginary  i've been to the places in newton  iowa  where some of this stuff is being made  i understand he may not have figured out how to drive a car with a windmill on it  but if he came to iowa  he'd know that   percent of iowa's electricity now comes from wind energy  america has doubled the amount of electricity we get from wind over the last   years  enough power for nearly   million homes clean  renewable energy  that's something you leave behind for the next generation  that is worth fighting for  there are   american jobs at stake in this wind energy tax credit  we should support it  i support it  and instead of giving   billion in taxpayer subsidies to oil companies that are making plenty of money every time you go to the pump  we should be investing in homegrown energy that's never been more promising  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term  i'm not done yet  in   i promised to end the war in iraq  i ended it  governor romney said the way i ended it was  tragic  i said i'd go after al qaida and bin laden  i went after them  we're now beginning a transition out of afghanistan  and so all of this is possible only because of the extraordinary service of our men and women in uniform  and that's why i've made sure to make historic investments in the va  because somebody who has fought for us shouldn't have to fight for a job when they come home  but if we're serious about them coming home to a strong economy  then we've got to do some building here at home  some nation building  take half of the money that we've been spending over a decade of war  and let's start doing some rebuilding here in america  let's put americans back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and ports and airports  laying broadband lines in rural communities  let's create a veterans jobs corps so returning heroes can get jobs as firefighters and cops in communities that need them  there's a lot of work to be done right here in america  and i'm running to rebuild america  that's a choice in this election  and i'm running to make sure america once again has the best education system in the world and the best training system for workers in the world  i want to help our schools hire and reward the best teachers  especially in math and science  i want to give   million more americans the chance to go to community colleges to train for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  i want to get colleges and universities to bring down the cost of tuition so that every young person can get the kind of education that they need to succeed in the  st century  i want to help homeowners refinance their homes  save   bucks at these historically low rates  governor romney thinks we should just let the housing market bottom out  that's a difference in this election  i believe that you should have some health care security  that's why i passed obamacare  and i like obamacare  i like the phrase obamacare because you know what  i do care  i care about the i care about all those folks with preexisting conditions who now are going to be able to get coverage  i care about folks who already have insurance  making sure insurance companies don't jerk them around right when they need that insurance the most  i care about the   million young people who are now able to stay on their parent's plan and don't have to go without insurance  i care about the seniors who now have more discounts on their prescriptions drugs  and we're closing the doughnut hole  so  waterloo  we don't need another   years of arguing about health care  the supreme court has spoken  we are implementing this law  we are moving forward  we're not moving backwards  all these things health care security  american manufacturing  rebuilding america  putting construction workers back to work  making sure our kids are getting a great education and can afford college all these things that make up a middle class life  they all tie together  it goes back to that central idea of america  that here in this country everybody gets a fair shot  everybody does their fair share  everybody plays by the same set of rules  it's the same promise our parents and grandparents passed on to us  and now  our job is to pass it on to our kids  now  over the next   months  the other side will spend more money than we have ever seen  now  you notice their ads generally don't tell you what it is that they're going to do because they know their plans won't sell  you haven't forgotten  you didn't get amnesia   i laughter i  you didn't forget the last time they tried what they're selling  so basically  the argument that they're going to make over and over again is just the same one  which is the economy is still not where it needs to be and it's obama's fault   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and you know what  listen  the economy is not where it needs to be  we've still got too many folks out of work and too many homes under water  and we haven't brought back all the jobs that need to be brought back  but you know what  what they're offering  it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to reduce the deficit  they don't have a plan to grow the economy  they don't have a plan to revive the middle class  the plan i've put forward can do that  but i need your help  i need your help  i need your help  your friends have to be registered  your family has to be registered  you can get a voter registration form online  just go to gottaregister com  this is not got to register com  this is g o t t a register gottaregister com  gotta register because we've come too far to turn back now  we've been outspent before  i've been counted out before  but here's what i know  when all of you decide to mobilize and organize  and when you focus on those values that are best in america  when you remember the stories of your family and your parents  your grandparents  the hard work  the sacrifice  recognizing sometimes times are tough and sometimes we get knocked down  but we get back up we are determined  we are tougher than any tough times  and most importantly  that reminder that when we do things together  when we're focused on how we build this country together  we can't be stopped  that's more powerful than any money  that's more powerful than any tv commercials  so we've got to keep on going because we've got too many schools we still need to build  too many teachers we still need to hire  too many kids we still need to send to college  we've got too many roads we still need to build  too much energy we've still got to generate right here at home  too many troops we've got to bring home  too many doors of opportunity that we've got to open up for every young person who's willing to make the effort  that's what's at stake right now  and if you're willing to stand with me and work with me and vote for me  we will win iowa  we will win in november  and we will finish what we started and remind the world why america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the first lady i  i decided to bring someone out with me  you may know this guy  i want to start by thanking amanda for that very kind introduction  we are so proud of her  and we are so grateful for her service  so let's give amanda   i the president i  yay   i the first lady i another round of applause  and thank you  amanda  for getting the president to eat some fruit this morning  that's good   i laughter i  well  you guys  this looks amazing  you all sound really fired up   i the president i  fired up  fired up   i the first lady i  and you definitely sound ready to go   i the president i  ready to go   i the first lady i  and let me tell you  i'm glad to hear it because   i audience member i  four more years   i the first lady i  yes  indeed  with your help  with your help  let me just say this  i shared this with the folks earlier today  but being back in the great state of iowa i applause i yes  indeed where it all began for us  i have to say i'm feeling pretty fired up and ready to go myself  our family has so many great memories of our time here in iowa  as i mentioned earlier  i remember when we went to pella  and an entire neighborhood sang  happy birthday  to malia on the fourth of july  yeah  it was so sweet  i remember  on the big day at the jefferson jackson dinner  we danced with about a thousand folks across the state with the isiserettes  it's a marching band  we've had them back to the white house since  but that was exciting  and our girls still talk about our visit to the state fair  that was like  i think  the first big state fair we ever went to  and it was so much fun  we did everything  we rode the bumper cars  and we slid down this big slide  i mentioned how barack almost dropped sasha i laughter i off of the slide  she flew up  and he barely i wasn't very happy about that   i laughter i  and that is where  yes  we experienced our very first fried twinkie on a stick  it was here  and it was also pretty funny because he was a senator at the time and he had a lot of press  and they were everywhere  and the girls were holding baby chicks  and the cameras were flashing  and so when it was time for him to leave he left early the girls actually turned around to me and said   whew  i'm so glad daddy's gone   i laughter i   now we can really have some fun  so i laughter i we essentially shut the state fair down  so we had a great time  and i'll have to say that i'm a little bit jealous that barack got to go to the state fair this week without me   i audience members i  aww   i the first lady i  oh  it's so sad   i the president i  it was good   i laughter i   i the first lady i  so today i want to start by saying thank you  truly  thank you  i want to thank everybody in the state for the kindness and generosity and love that you all have shown our family  regardless of what party you're from  regardless of how you felt about us  you have shown us so much love  and you don't understand how important that was for me because iowa was my very first experience with a national campaign  and because of you all  this state  the people in this state  our girls still think campaigning is fun   i laughter i  they really do   i at this point  the first lady made brief remarks  concluding as follows i  so i know that we cannot turn back now not now  we have come so far  but we have so much more to do  and if we keep on moving forward  then we need to work our hearts out for this man that i have the pleasure of introducing here today  my husband and our president  president barack obama   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  hello  davenport  it is good to be back in the quads  i see a lot of familiar faces  a lot of good friends  first of all  let me just say that i  too  could not be prouder of amanda irish  her service to this country  everything that she's done  she wants to go back to medical school  she is going to be a great doctor  and she's going to help a lot of people  give her a big round of applause  your mayor and a great friend of mine for a long  long time  bill gluba is here  there is another friend of mine who's here that isn't going to come up on stage  but i want to make a special mention of him  he's from the other side of the river  he's an illinoisan  but i tell you what  this is a guy who served his country  looked after veterans  was a fighter for working families  and was the first guy outside of chicago to endorse me and support me when i ran for the united states senate back in   and if it had not been for his support  i wouldn't be standing here today  he has shown even more courage in battling parkinson's and is somebody who i will always think of when i think of integrity and public service  so i just want everybody to give a big round of applause to former congressman lane evans  a great friend of mine  lane's right there  and finally  let me say something about my wife  i don't usually like to follow her speaking i laughter i because  let's face it  on the charisma rankings in my household  you've got her  the girls  bo i laughter i and then my mother in law and then me  actually  my mother in law is before bo  obviously  but i laughter i  i love my mother in law too  that's where michelle got her looks from  so when other obamas are participating  i tend to kind of not shine quite as much  but i've called her the rock of our family  that may sell it short  i don't know anybody who is more honest  who is stronger  who knows who she is  knows what's important  remembers where she came from  is the best mom in the world  keeps me in line  keeps me straight  keeps me humble and she's cute  so i told people back in   i won't be a perfect president  i'm not a perfect man  but we do have a perfect first lady  please give it up for michelle obama  now  as michelle mentioned  this is our third day in iowa  i started out in council bluffs  and we're drove here  all the way to the quads  west to east  and we've stopped all across the state  everywhere we've gone  we have had fun  it is true  i've eaten a lot   i laughter i  at the state fair i had a pork chop and a beer  and it was very good  but we met farmers who have been hurt badly by the drought and talked to them about the importance of congress getting its act together and passing a farm bill  that's not an issue that's been partisan in the past  there's no reason it should be now  especially when farmers are and ranchers are hurting  we met folks who have helped iowa become a leader in wind energy and talked about how we need to keep investing in clean  renewable energy  this morning i had breakfast with amanda and a number of other veterans and listened to their stories about not only the pride they took in serving their country  but also they were pretty honest about some of the difficulties when they came home  and i reminded them that as commander in chief  one promise i guarantee you i'll keep  we are going to make sure we serve our veterans as well as they've served us  and everywhere i went  i was reminded because i'd see folks who i hadn't seen in a couple of years  friends  neighbors  hit spots we had gone to in    i was reminded of how this movement for change started in folks' backyards and in school gyms and in vfw halls and in diners all across this state  and this may be the last stop on our particular trip here this week  but that journey that we started back in   it's not finished  we've got a lot more work to do  we've got unfinished business to attend to  i've come here to ask you to stand with me and help me finish the job  i'm asking you to help finish what we started  to bring about the change that is going to make america live up to its promise  not just for this generation  but for generations to come  that is why i am running for a second term as president of the united states of america  three months less than   months from now  less than   months not that i'm counting i laughter i you will face a choice  and that choice could not be bigger   i audience member i  four more years   i the president i  it's a choice that you face this november that is not just about two candidates or two political parties  it's a choice between two fundamentally different visions of where to take america  and the direction that you choose when you walk into that voting booth is not going to have a direct not just going to have a direct impact on your lives  it's going to have an impact on your kids' lives and your grandchildren's lives  when we came together in    democrats  independents  and  yes  some republicans we came together to restore that basic bargain that built this country  michelle talked about it  simple idea  here in this country  if you work hard you can get ahead  here in this country  if you take responsibility and you put in the effort  you should be able to find a job that supports a family  you should be able to find a home you can call your own  you shouldn't go bankrupt when you get sick  you should be able to retire with dignity and respect  and most of all  you should be able to give your kids the kind of education and opportunity that allows them to dream even bigger and do even better than we ever did  that is the basic american promise  and that promise was being broken  we'd seen a decade where jobs were being shipped overseas and where wages and incomes were going down  except for a few at the very top  even while the costs of everything from health care to college were skyrocketing  we saw two wars fought on a credit card  surplus going into deficit  all culminating in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  so we knew that restoring that basic american idea that if you work hard you can get ahead  that it wouldn't be easy  that it was going to take more than one year or one term or even one president  and that was all before we saw how badly this financial crisis hammered middle class families  folks losing their homes and losing their jobs  losing their savings  all pushing that american dream a little further out of reach  and i told you in  years ago  i said  don't look for quick fixes  we didn't get into this overnight  we're not going to solve it overnight  but what i said  and what is still true  is we've got all the things we need  all the ingredients  we've got the capacity to meet our challenges  we've still got the best workers in the world  we've got the best farmers in the world  we've got the best small businesspeople in the world  we've got the best scientists and researchers and colleges and universities in the world  we're a young nation  and we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity  people want to come here from every corner of the globe  no matter what the naysayers may say  there is not another country on earth that would not trade places with the united states of america  people around the world understand this is still a place where no matter what you look like or where you come from or what your last name is  you can make it  and that's the idea we're trying to rebuild  that's why we're that's what this campaign's about  that's what the last   years have been about  every day  i've woken up thinking about you  that's what we thought about when we put in place the recovery act to help make sure that everybody who needed it got a tax cut  to make sure that teachers could stay on the job and firefighters and cops  that's what i was thinking about when we saved the auto industry that was about to go under  that's how we've worked with businesses to help create   million new jobs  half a million in manufacturing  but we've got a long way to go  we've got more work to do  we know that  and the big challenge we have right now is not a lack of big ideas  it's not a lack of solutions  our problem is politics in washington  we've got folks on the other side who think  compromise  is a dirty word and basically have only two ideas to grow the economy  one is to get rid of regulations that we put in place to make sure that we don't have another tax funded bailout taxpayer funded bailout when the banks make reckless decisions or make sure that polluters aren't polluting or make sure insurance companies aren't taking advantage of you  so they want to strip away those regulations  and the other big idea they've got is the same kind of top down economics that got us into this mess in the first place  governor romney's big idea is a   trillion tax cut  on top of the bush tax cuts  a lot of which would be going to the wealthiest americans  who've already been doing very well   i audience member i  romney hood i   i i audience members i  boo   i audience member i  romney hood   i the president i  and here's the kicker  he's expecting you to pay for it   i audience members i  no   i the president i  because   trillion is a lot of money   i laughter i  that's   times our defense budget  so that would be the equivalent of our defense budget in tax cuts every single year  and his basic idea is that middle class families with children would see their tax bill go up an average   this is not my analysis  this is an analysis that was done by independent economists  and they're asking you to pay more in your taxes not to reduce the deficit or grow jobs or invest in education  but to give another   tax cut to people making   million a year or more   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  his allies in congress have the same view  you heard that he announced congressman ryan as his running mate  and look  congressman ryan  i know him  he's a good man  a family man  but he is the ideological leader of this republican congress  and he's a very articulate spokesperson for governor romney's vision  the problem is the vision's wrong  we don't agree with it  they have tried to sell us this top down  trickle down economics before   i laughter i  we just tried it right before i took office  and guess what  it did not work  it didn't work then  and it won't work now  it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to reduce the deficit  it's not a plan to move our economy forward  now  secretly  i think they know this  they understand their economic plan isn't very popular  because they started making all kinds of stuff up about my plans  i'll give you an example  lately  they've been talking about medicare  now  keep in mind these are both governor romney and congressman ryan in the past have said they want to voucherize the medicare system   i audience members i  boo   i audience member i  no way   i the president i  here's what i've done  i've strengthened medicare  i've made reforms that save millions of seniors with medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription drugs  we're closing the doughnut hole  i've proposed reforms that will save medicare money by getting rid of wasteful spending in the health care system  reforms that will not touch your medicare benefits  and governor romney and his running mate have a different plan  they want to turn medicare into a voucher system  that means seniors would no longer have the guarantee of medicare  they'd get a voucher to buy private insurance  and if it doesn't keep up with costs  well  that's the seniors' problem   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  it was estimated that governor romney's running mate  his original plan would force seniors to pay an extra   a year   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  my plan's extended medicare by nearly a decade  their plan ends medicare as we know it  my plan reduces the cost of medicare by cracking down on fraud and waste and subsidies to insurance companies  their plan makes seniors pay more to help finance another tax cuts for folks who don't need it  that's an example of the difference between our two philosophies  that's the choice in this election  and that is why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  you know  when it comes to taxes    years ago i promised to cut middle class taxes  i did it  if anybody tells you democrats are all big tax and spend  you tell them  well  my taxes are lower than they were before president obama took office by about   for a typical family  so now i want to keep taxes right where they are for the first   of everybody's income  if your family makes under  like   percent of americans and   percent of small businesses you won't see your income taxes increase by a single dime next year  now  if you're fortunate enough to be in the other   percent  you'll still keep the tax cut on the first   you make  but if you're making more than that  we're going to ask you to contribute just a little bit more to help pay down the deficit and allow us to still invest in things like education that help the economy grow  that won't solve the whole deficit problem  we've still got to make some smart cuts  i've already cut a trillion dollars of spending  we can do more  but we can't just balance our budget on the backs of middle class families   i audience members i  no   i the president   i not just on the backs of the poor  so what i've said is  look  i know folks like me are in a position to do a little bit more  go back to the rates we paid under bill clinton  a time when we created   million new jobs  we had a budget surplus instead of a deficit  and guess what  you know what  millionaires did good too   i laughter i  businesses and corporations did well too  and here's the reason  when a teacher or a firefighter or a receptionist or a construction worker  when they've got a little more money in their pockets  when you've got a little more money pockets  what do you do   i audience members i  spend it   i the president i  you spend it  because times are tough  you maybe haven't bought a new car in   years  maybe you've got an old broken appliance that's just been sitting there  doesn't work  maybe your kid is going to college and you want to make sure they've got a computer to help them with their studies  so you go out  and now businesses have more customers  and when businesses have more customers  they make more profit  and when they make more profit  they hire more workers  and then those workers have a little more money  and they go out and spend some more  see  when you look at the history of this country  we didn't grow through top down economics  we grew through middle class out economics  we grew from bottom up economics  we grew together  where everybody got a fair shot and everybody's doing their fair share and everybody's playing by the same set of rules  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  so on almost every issue  you're going to have a choice  when the auto industry was on the brink of collapse  governor romney said  let's  let detroit go bankrupt  i said  that's a million workers at stake  and i believe in american workers  and   years later  the american auto industry has come roaring back  so now i want to make sure american manufacturing's taking root here  let's change this tax code once and for all  stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give them to companies that are investing here in the united states of america  governor romney wants to keep those tax breaks  he likes to talk about his private sector experience  but a lot of it was investing in companies that have been called  pioneers  of outsourcing  we don't need more outsourcing  we need more insourcing  that's a difference in this election  that's a choice in this election  i want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world  i want to make sure that local school districts can hire more teachers  especially in math and science  i want to make sure that   million more people can go to community colleges so they can get trained for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  and i want to keep pushing on colleges and universities to lower tuition so every young person can afford to get a higher education  that's a choice in this election  governor romney wants to end the tax credits for wind energy   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  wind energy creates   jobs in iowa  jobs  governor romney said these new sources of energy are  imaginary  congressman ryan said they're a  fad  those   jobs aren't a fad  they're our future  we should stop giving   billion a year in taxpayer subsidies to the big oil companies that are already making money and help create homegrown sources of energy that put americans back to work and help free ourselves from dependence on foreign oil  that's a choice in this election  in   i said i'd end the war in iraq  and i did  i said we'd refocus attention on al qaida and bin laden  and we did  we've set a timeline to end the war in afghanistan  all this was possible because of incredible men and women in uniform like amanda  so now we've got an obligation to make sure that our va and all our services are doing what we need to do for our veterans now that they're coming home  but part of that is also taking some of the savings after a decade of war and using them to put folks back to work doing some nation building here at home  let's rebuild some roads and some bridges  let's create a veterans job corps so they can get jobs as firefighters and cops in communities that need them  that's the america i want to build  that's a choice in this election  and let me just tell you one more choice  governor romney said one of the first things he's going to do on day one is he's going to kill obamacare   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  i've got to say  i've grown kind of fond of the term obamacare  because i do care  i care about all the families in iowa and illinois and all across the country that i've met who had preexisting conditions and now they know they're going to be able to get health care coverage  i care about   million young people who can now stay on their parent's plan because of obamacare  i care about the seniors who are getting discounts on their prescription drugs because of obamacare  so maybe governor romney wants to have another   years' worth of argument about health care  i want to move forward  the supreme court has spoken  we are implementing it  it is helping families all across this nation  we are moving forward  not backward  that's a difference in this election  so on all these issues whether it's health care security  making sure medicare is there for future generations  making sure that we're rebuilding america  making sure our kids are getting the best education possible these are all ingredients of what we know to be a middle class life  it's what michelle talked about  it's what helped michelle and me have the opportunities to do things that our parents could not have imagined  and now we want to make sure the next generation has it  and i know you guys feel the same way because you've got that same story  your parents  your grandparents  your great grandparents  the struggles they went through to give us a shot  we've got an obligation now to make sure our children have that same shot  that same opportunity  that's why this election's so important  that's what we're fighting for  and you know  over the next   months the other side will spend more money than we have ever seen on ads telling you one thing  that the economy is not so good and it's obama's fault  and you know  their economic theory doesn't sell  so that's going to be their message  and it may be a plan to win the election  but it's not a plan to create jobs or reduce the deficit or grow the economy  they don't have a plan to revive the middle class  but i do  and so i tell you what  we've come too far to turn back now  we've got too many jobs we got to create  we've got too many teachers we've got to hire  we've got too many students who need to afford to be able to go to college  we've got more energy we've got to generate and more troops we got to bring home  we've got more doors of opportunity that we've got to open to everybody who's willing to work hard to walk through them  so if you're willing to work with me one more time and stand with me one more time and knock on some doors one more time and make some phone calls one more time  if you're willing to vote for me this november  we'll win davenport  we'll win iowa  we'll win this election  we'll finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the first lady i  thank you  guys  oh  my goodness   i the president i  yay  flotus   i the first lady i  oh my goodness  this is so sweet   i audience member i  we love you   i the

introduction and for all she's doing for our country  and yes  it sounds like you all are pretty fired up  and very ready to go   i the president i  ready to go   i the first lady i  and i'm really glad to hear that  first of all  it's good to see my husband   i laughter i  because i haven't seen him in a good week   i the president i  five days   i the first lady i  five days   i the president i  five days   i the first lady i  it seemed like a week  it was so long   i laughter i   i the president i  i missed you   i audience member i  we love you   i the first lady i  just take care of him   i laughter i  but i am just as happy to be back in the great state of iowa  where it all began  so you guys are getting me all fired up just being here  it is so beautiful here  it is so beautiful  good to be back  our family has so many wonderful memories of our time here in iowa  in pella  i remember that an entire neighborhood sang  happy birthday  to malia on the fourth of july   i laughter i  that was so sweet  she was a little  bitty something too  and on the day of the big jefferson jackson dinner  i remember how we danced down the street with the isiserettes   i the president i  that's what they were called   i the first lady i  it was the isiserettes and a few thousand folks across the state  as well  were there too  so that was fun   i the president i  that was fun   i the first lady i  and our girls  malia and sasha  they still talk about our visit to the state fair  we had a ball  we rode the bumper cars  we slid down that big slide  where barack almost lost sasha   i laughter i  she flew up   i the president i  i held on   i the first lady i  thought she was it wasn't pretty  wasn't happy about that   i laughter i  and yes  we experienced the magic of our first fried twinkie  yes  we did  even though you say i don't let you eat them  you eat what you want   i laughter i  but we were surrounded by the press  so barack left  and the girls looked at me  and they said   oh  i'm so glad dad is gone   i laughter i  now we can have fun   i laughter i  so after he left  we stayed  we cut loose  we stayed until the fair shut down  it was a ball  and i have to say that we're all very jealous that barack got to go back to the fair without us last week  did you have a fried twinkie   i the president i  pork chop and beer   i laughter i   i the first lady i  he's so pleased with himself   i laughter i   i the president i  it was good  it was tasty   i the first lady i  but in all seriousness  though  because of those wonderful memories and so many more  i want to start by saying thank you  truly  thank you for the kindness  generosity and love that you have shown our family i mean  throughout the state consistently  iowa was our very first experience with a national campaign  truly  and it is because of all of you that malia and sasha still think campaigning is fun   i laughter i  they do  now  they never really want to go  but they're  like  that was fun   i laughter i  but more importantly  because of you  barack and i will always remember what this process can be at its very best  every election  you all remind us what democracy is all about  it's about people getting to know the issues and discussing them with their neighbors  it's about meeting your candidates and getting to know them and their families up close and personal   i at this point  the first lady made brief remarks  concluding as follows i  so we know that we can't turn back now  we have come so far  but we have so much more work to do  and if we keep moving forward  then we need to work our hearts out for the man that i have the pleasure of introducing  my husband and our president  president barack obama   i the president i  hello  dubuque  thank you  dubuque  how is everybody doing today  now  first of all  i too just want to thank jennifer for not just her introduction  but for serving as a military spouse and championing the causes that are so important for so many military families like hers  and so please give her a big another round of applause  thank you for everything that you do  very proud of you  i also want to acknowledge  sitting next to jennifer is congressman bruce braley who helped to get the bill that jennifer had worked on  based on her experience with andrew  passed  and i had the honor of signing into law congressman bruce braley  who is doing a great job on behalf of our veterans and on behalf of working people here in iowa  a couple of other friends who are here your own attorney general this guy supported me when nobody could pronounce my name   i laughter i  folks would say  tom  why are you doing that  but he is a man of great integrity  a champion on behalf of consumers nationwide as well as here in iowa  tom miller is here  give him a big round of applause  also  your own mayor  mayor roy buol is here  give roy a big round of applause  and finally  my wife  now  it is true  i have not seen her in   days and except i caught the end of leno   i laughter i  and the only reason that she  i think  is happy to see me is because she knows that after today  she gets to go tomorrow and get our girls from sleep away camp  and she has been missing them terribly  so we stand in the way of her getting to her babies   i laughter i   i audience member i  it's okay  we still love you   i laughter i   i the president i  but i have to tell you  when i stand here and listen to her  i am just reminded how lucky i am  because she is a woman of strength and integrity and honor  she keeps me straight every single day  she is the best mom in the world  and she's cute   i laughter i  and the problem is  sometimes when i listen to her talk  i start choking up a little bit  and i forget what i'm going to say   i laughter i  but i could not be prouder of her  and i say often back in   i said  look  i'm not a perfect man  i won't be a perfect president  i do think she is a perfect first lady  i just want you to know that  now  this is our third day in iowa  and she's right  we have been traveling all across the state  we did stop at the state fair  we stopped to get something to eat before she showed up  just so there wasn't any issues   i audience member i  smart man   i the president i  smart man   i laughter i  we began the journey in council bluffs  and just like   years ago  we've traveled all across this state  west to east  meeting with you and talking about your lives  we've driven through boone and des moines and oskaloosa and marshalltown and waterloo and cedar rapids  we've met farmers who've been badly hurt by drought and who now need us to pass a farm bill  we met folks who've helped iowa become a leader in wind energy  and now we need us they need us to keep investing in clean  renewable energy  this morning i had breakfast with some of our outstanding veterans who proud fought under our proud flag  and so now we need to serve them just as well as they've served us and make sure that they've got new jobs and new opportunities and a roof over their heads when they come home  and every stop  i've got fond memories of the last campaign  the campaign we had   years ago  every stop  i've gotten reminders of what makes iowa so special and how this is where our movement for change happened  it was because of you  it was because of your stories and your strength and your spirit that i had the strength and the spirit to go through that campaign  and it's because of you that i've had the strength to do the job over the last   years  and i've got to tell you  iowa  we're not done yet  this journey is not done yet  we've got some unfinished business to do  and i've come here to ask you to stand with me  just like you stood with me in   to finish what we started  because less than   months from now  you will face a choice  and that choice could not be bigger  this is a choice not just between two candidates  it's not just between two political parties  more than any election in recent memory  this is a choice about two fundamentally different visions for our country  how we move this country forward  and the direction that you choose when you walk into that voting booth will have an impact not just on your lives  but on the lives of your children and the lives of your grandchildren  it will impact us for decades to come  when we came together in  and it wasn't just democrats  we had independents and some republicans too it was to restore the basic bargain that built this country  the basic bargain that made us the most prosperous economy in the world  it's a bargain that says if we work hard  we should be rewarded  it's a deal that says if you put in enough effort  you can find a job that pays the bills  you can afford a home that you call your own  you won't go broke when you get sick  you can retire with dignity and respect  and most of all  it's a bargain that says your kids will get a great education and they'll grow up safe and healthy  and they will have opportunities that you couldn't even dream of  that they will be able to achieve things that you could have only hoped for  that's the basic promise of america  that's the american dream  and we knew that restoring it wouldn't be easy  that it would take more than one year  or one term  or even one president  because we had just gone through a decade in which the middle class had been taking a lot of hits  jobs had been getting shipped overseas  incomes and wages were flat or even going down  while the cost of everything from health care to college were going up  a few folks at the top were doing really well  but the average family was struggling  and this was before we saw the worst financial crisis since the great depression  and so many more of our friends and neighbors and family members lost their jobs and lost their homes  lost their savings and pushed that american dream even further out of reach  so when i ran for this office   years ago  i told you there were no quick fixes  there were no easy solutions  that's still true today  but what i also told you and what is also still true today is that we have the capacity to meet every challenge  we've got everything we need to meet our challenges  we've still got the best workers in the world  we've still got the best entrepreneurs  and small businessmen and women in the world  we've got the best scientists and researchers in the world  we've got the best farmers in the world  we've got the best colleges and universities in the world  we are still a young nation  and we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity  people want to come here from every corner of the globe  so no matter what the naysayers say  no matter how dark the other side tries to paint things  there is not another country on earth that wouldn't gladly change places with the united states of america  because people understand that even though we go through some tough times  there is a resilience and grit about this country  and this country is the place where if you're willing to work hard no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your last name is you can make it  that's the idea that we were trying to rebuild in   that's the idea that we continue to pursue in   that is what this campaign is all about  and that is why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  dubuque  here's the thing i told you all the things we've got going for us we do have one problem  politics in washington   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  you've got the other side  which has decided that compromise is a dirty word and thinks the only way to move forward is to go backwards to the same top down economics that got us into this mess in the first place   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  you know  governor romney chose his running mate this week  congressman ryan   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  no  no  congressman ryan  i know him  he's a good man  beautiful family  he is the ideological leader of the republicans in congress  he is a articulate spokesman for governor romney's vision  i just happen to fundamentally disagree with his vision  their vision is wrong for working families  and it is wrong for the country  look  my opponent and his friends in congress  they believe that if you just get rid of more regulations on big corporations and big banks and then you give more tax breaks to the wealthiest americans  that that will automatically lead to jobs and prosperity for ordinary families  and i'm not exaggerating here  that's their basic economic plan  the centerpiece of governor romney's economic plan is a new   trillion tax cut  a lot of it going to the wealthiest americans   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  keep in mind    trillion is a lot of money  even in washington  our entire defense budget is a little over half a trillion dollars a year  so this tax cut would be like giving the equivalent of the entire defense budget in tax cuts a lot of it going to very rich people every year for   years  now  these folks say they want to reduce the deficit and the debt  so the question is  well  how do you give away   trillion and then reduce the deficit  well  recently  we found out  governor romney expects you to pay for it   i audience members i  boo   i the president i expects middle class families to pick up the tab  governor romney's tax plan would actually raise taxes on middle class families by an average of   for families with children   i audience member i  i don't have    i the president i  you don't have   to spare  i didn't think so  and by the way  don't take my word for it  this is based on independent studies that have been done by folks who analyze this stuff for a living  they say  look  this will cost middle class families with children an average of   and they're asking you to pay an extra   bucks not to reduce the deficit  not to help our kids get educated  not to help kids go to college  not to rebuild our roads or our bridges or our ports  they're doing this to give another   tax cut to folks who are making   million a year or more   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  have you heard this before   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  they have been trying to sell this trickle down snake oil before   i laughter i  and guess what  it didn't work then  it won't work now  it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to reduce the deficit  it's not a plan to move the economy forward  and secretly  i think they know this  i think they know their plan is not very popular  you can tell that because they're being pretty dishonest about my plan  especially  by the way  when it comes to medicare  now  this is something i've got to point out here  because they are just throwing everything at the wall to see if it sticks   i laughter i  here's what you need to know  i have strengthened medicare  i have made reforms that have saved millions of seniors with medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription drugs  i have proposed reforms that will save medicare money by getting rid of wasteful spending in the health care system  reforms that will not touch your medicare benefits  not by a dime  now  mr  romney and his running mate have a very different plan  they want to turn medicare into a voucher program   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  that means seniors would no longer have the guarantee of medicare  they'd get a voucher to buy private insurance  and because the voucher wouldn't keep up with costs  the plan authored by governor romney's running mate  congressman ryan  would force seniors to pay an extra   a year  and i assume they don't have it   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  my plan has already extended medicare by nearly a decade  their plan ends medicare as we know it  my plan reduces the costs of medicare by cracking down on fraud and waste and subsidies to insurance companies  their plan makes seniors pay more so they can give another tax cut to millionaires and billionaires  that's the difference between our plans on medicare  that's an example of the choice in this election  and that is why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  just like we've got a different plan on medicare  we've got a different economic plan  you just heard  they want to give   trillion tax cuts  tax breaks to wealthy americans who don't need them  four years ago  i promised to cut middle class taxes  and  dubuque  that's exactly what i've done  so if you talk to a friend of yours who says  oh  those democrats  they're all tax and spend liberals  you tell them the average middle class family  their taxes are about   lower since i've become president  and right now what i want to do is to keep taxes right where they are for the first   of everybody's income  if your family makes under  like   percent of american families do and   percent of small businesses do you won't see your income taxes increase by a single dime next year  now  if you're fortunate enough to be in the other   percent   i audience member i  i wish   i laughter i   i the president i  if you're fortunate enough to be in the other   percent  you still get a tax cut on your first   but all we're asking is  if for the next little bit that you make you can afford to contribute a little bit more  above   so that we can pay down our deficit in a responsible  balanced way and invest in things like education that help america grow  now  that alone won't cut our deficit  we're going to have to still make sure government does its part  we've already cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending that we don't need  and we can do more to make government more efficient  we have to do more  but we're not going to reduce the deficit just on the backs of the middle class  so i think it makes sense to ask folks like me who've been incredibly blessed to go back to the rates that we paid under bill clinton  a time  by the way  when nearly   million new jobs were created  we went from deficit to surplus  and here's the kicker we created a lot of millionaires too   i laughter i  and the reason is  is because the economy  when you look back on american history  always works best when the middle class is doing well  let me ask you something  when a teacher or a construction worker or a receptionist or a firefighter  when you get a little extra money in your pocket  what do you do   i audience members i  spend it   i the president i  you spend it  because times are tight and maybe you've been driving around in that old beater  you had that car for   years  and you decide it's about time to trade it in  or maybe you think now is the time i can finally buy a new computer for my kid who is about to go off to college  or maybe i'll go to a restaurant  or heaven forbid  i take a vacation once in a while   i laughter i  and what happens is that suddenly businesses have more customers  and they make more profits  and so folks at the top are doing very well  but the businesses  because they're more profitable  now they're hiring more workers  who then have more money  who then buy more products  who then give businesses more customers  that's how you grow an economy  not from the top down  from the middle out  from the bottom up  giving everybody a fair shot  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president  because that's what i believe  that's my vision for the future  on just about every issue  governor romney and i just have a different opinion  when the auto industry was on the brink of collapse  more than a million jobs at stake  governor romney said let's let detroit go bankrupt  i said let's bet on american workers  and we got workers and management together  and they changed how they were doing business  and   years later  the american auto industry is back on top  that's what i believe  that's the kind of america we need  so now i want american manufacturing back in america  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give those tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in dubuque  right here in the quads  right here in iowa  in cleveland and raleigh  let's put people back to work  governor romney likes to say  well  you know what  i know how to fix the economy  because i've been in the private sector  well  it turns out that a lot of that experience was investing in companies that were called  pioneers  in outsourcing  we don't need folks who know how to outsource  we need folks who are working to insource  to create jobs here  and hire american workers so we sell american products around the world stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's what i believe  on energy  governor romney has said that he wants to get rid of the tax credit for wind energy doesn't believe in it he says these sources of energy are  imaginary  congressman ryan calls them a  fad  he needs to come to iowa  he'll find out that there are   jobs in this state that depend on the wind industry  these jobs aren't a  fad  they're the future  we should stop giving   billion of taxpayer subsidies to oil companies that are making money every time you go to the pump  let's start investing in clean energy that will create jobs and secure our future  that's a difference in this election  i want to make sure that our kids are getting the best education in the world  i was just visiting some teachers before cascade middle school  right before i came here  aren't you supposed to be at the in service over there   i laughter i  i won't tell  just don't get photographed   i laughter i  and we had this great meeting  but and folks don't go into teaching for the money  they go into it because they believe in our kids  they believe in our future  so but school districts all across iowa and all across the country are having a tough time  budget cuts  teacher layoffs  so i've said let's help local school districts to make sure they can hire great teachers  especially in math and science  where we've got to really do better in terms of our performance  let's make sure that   million more people can go to community colleges to train for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now  and let's bring down college tuitions once and for all for young people  because higher education is not a luxury  it's an economic necessity for young people  back in   i said i'd end the war in iraq  we ended it  i said we'd go after al qaida and bin laden  we did  we are transitioning and bringing our troops out of afghanistan  and so after a decade of war  i say to folks none of this could have been accomplished if it hadn't been for our amazing men and women in uniform  so we've got to make investments to make sure that they're getting the services that they have earned  because they should never have to fight for a job when they have fought for this country  and let's take half the money that we can save after a decade of war  and let's do some nation building here at home  let's hire some hardhats to get on the job rebuilding roads and bridges  schools  that's good for the economy  that's where we need to take america  now  governor romney says his big economic plan in addition to these tax cuts for the wealthy he wants to kill obamacare  get rid of it   i audience members i  no   i the president i  now  first of all  i want you to know i kind of like the term obamacare   i laughter i  because i do care  that's why i passed the bill  i care about folks with preexisting conditions  which is why  because of this law  they'll be able to get health insurance  i care about the   million young people who can now stay on their parent's plan because of obamacare  i care about the seniors who have seen discounts on their prescription drugs  we're closing the doughnut hole because of the law that we passed  so if mr  romney and congressman ryan want to spend the next   years having the same argument we had about health care all over again  they can feel free to try to do it  but the supreme court has spoken  it is the law of the land  we are moving forward to give every american the health security that they deserve  that is the difference in this election  on all these issues health care  manufacturing  education all these things that go into creating a solid  secure middle class life  all these issues tie together  it goes back to what michelle was talking about and what i started off with  and that is who we are  our values  you know  we've gone through tough times  but what hasn't changed is our character  americans are tough  and we are resilient  and we may get knocked down  but we bounce back up  and the other thing that we understand is what our parents and our grandparents and our great grandparents taught us  which is  if you work hard  this is the country to be  that you may meet some barriers some times  there may be some hurdles  but you can't be stopped when you decide on something  and that's what's at stake in this election  do we affirm those values and pass them on to our kids and our grandkids just like we got them from our parents and our grandparents  now  over the next   months  you are going to see more negative ads than you've ever seen in your life  you're already seeing them  and these folks on the other side  i mean  they're just writing   million checks  governor romney obviously has got more friends than i do that can write   million checks   i laughter i  and they are just they are running these ads  and they're not selling a plan to create jobs or to grow the economy or revive the middle class  basically  they've got one message  and that is  the economy is not where it should be and it's obama's fault  and they're just going to say it over and over again  over and over again  you're going to get sick of it  you already are  and you know  i've got to admit  i would be worried  given the amount of money that is being spent  if it weren't for iowa  if it weren't for what i remember about   see  we've been outspent before  we've been counted out before  but what i know is  when the american people cut through the nonsense and they focus on what's important  and when they remember what it means for us to have a country where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same set of rules  when you guys decide what's important  you can't be stopped  when you pull together  you've got more power than any guy who is writing a   million check  and so  iowa  i'm going to need your help one more time  here  to finish the job  we've got more schools to build  we've got more folks to put back to work  we've got more roads to build  we've got more young people to send to college  we've got more troops to come home  and if you are willing to

will win this election  we will finish what we started  and you and i together will remind the world why america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  new hampshire  thank you  it's good to be back  it is good to be back in new hampshire  well  first of all  thank you guys all for being here  i know it's a little bit warm   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  just a i love you back  so for those of you everybody who is standing  i want you to kind of bend your knees a little bit   i laughter i  we usually see a few folks kind of dropping out a little bit when it's this warm  if you've got a seat  feel free to sit down and relax  i want everybody to give a big round of applause to beth talbott  not only for the great introduction  but for being an outstanding teacher  i love teachers  love them  two other people i want to acknowledge  first of all  congressional candidate annie kuster is here  give annie a big round of applause  and my national cochair back in   one of my earliest supporters in new hampshire great guy paul hodes is here  give paul a big round of applause  and all of you are here  and i'm very happy about that  let me also say  by the way  thank you for returning malia and sasha safe and sound  they were up here for camp for a month  they had a wonderful time  but their parents missed them a lot   i laughter i  so we were glad to get them back  but you guys took good care of them while they were up here  so i appreciate that  now  while they were at camp there are no tvs at camp but unless you've been able to hide your tv set or your cable is broke  you may be aware that there is a campaign going on right now   i laughter i  and part of the reason the campaign is so intense is because the choice we face in november could not be bigger  it's not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties  it is a choice between two fundamentally different visions about where to take the country  two fundamentally different paths for america  and the decisions that you make  the direction you choose for us to walk in when you walk into that voting booth in november  it's going to have an impact not just on your lives  but it's going to have an impact on your kids and your grandkids and generations to come  some of you were involved in   when we came together  and it wasn't just democrats  we had independents  we had even some republicans   i audience member i  yes   i the president i  there you go   i laughter i  and the idea was that we needed to restore the basic bargain that made this country great  the basic bargain that created the most prosperous economy that the world has even known  and it's a simple bargain  it says  if you work hard  that work should be rewarded  it says that if you put in enough effort and you take seriously your responsibilities  you should be able to find a job that pays the bills  you should be able to afford a home you can call your own  you should count on health care if you get sick  you should be able to retire with some dignity and some respect after a lifetime of labor  and most important  you should be able to give your kids the kind of education and opportunity that allows them to dream bigger and do better than you ever did  that's the american promise  that's the american dream  and we knew restoring it wouldn't be easy  that it would take more than one year or one term or even one president  because we had gone through a decade in which that promise was not being kept  we had seen a decade in which incomes and wages were going down even as the cost of everything from health care to college were going up   i audience member i  say it again  mr  president  so we can hear it again   i the president i  we had seen a decade i laughter i in which jobs were being shipped overseas  in which we took a surplus and turned it into a deficit  ran two wars on a credit card  all culminating in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  and middle class families who were already getting hammered lost their jobs  lost their savings  some lost their homes  and the american dream seemed even further out of reach  so when i ran for office  i told you there are no quick fixes  there are no easy solutions  but what i also insisted was that if we pull together  we have everything we need to meet our challenges   i audience member i  yes  we can   i the president i  yes  we can  we still have the best workers in the world  the best entrepreneurs and small businesspeople in the world  the best scientists  the best researchers  the best universities  the best colleges in the world  we're still a young nation  and we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity  there's a reason why people still want to come here  because no matter what the naysayers say and no matter how stark the other side tries to paint the situation during election time  there is not another country on earth that wouldn't gladly change places with the united states of america  most of all  the american character has not changed  in fact  we saw during this crisis how people may have gotten knocked down  but they got right back up  folks people in their  s   s losing their jobs go back to school  they get retrained and find a new one  small businesspeople keeping their doors open even if it meant them not taking a salary  because they understood their workers had families that were depending on them  we may have gone through tough times  but it turns out we're tougher than tough times  and that's how we saved an auto industry on the brink of collapse  that's how we've created   million new jobs  half a million in manufacturing  we are not there yet  we've still got a long way to go  because we've got to make sure that here in america  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your last name is  here in america  you can make it if you try  that's what this campaign's about  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  i've got to say remember  i said this is a choice in this election  we've got a particular vision about how to move the country forward  my opponent and his running mate have a very different view  they believe the best way forward is to go right back to the old top down economics that got us into this mess in the first place   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  they their ideas are pretty simple  they're not hard to explain  they think that if we get rid of more regulations on big corporations and big banks some of which we put in place to prevent another taxpayer funded bailout and if we do more tax cuts for the very wealthiest americans  then somehow prosperity is going to rain down on all of you   i laughter i  that's their theory  in fact  the centerpiece of my opponent's entire economic plan is a new   trillion tax cut  a lot of it going to the wealthiest americans  his new running mate  congressman ryan  he put forward   i audience members i  boo   i the president   i he put forward a plan that would let governor romney pay less than   percent in taxes each year  now and here's the kicker  he expects you to pick up the tab   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  governor romney's tax plan this is not my analysis now  this is the analysis of independent folks who analyze tax plans for a living   i laughter i  that's what they do   i laughter i  their analysis showed that governor romney's tax plan would actually raise taxes on middle class families with children by an average of    i audience members i  boo   i the president   i not to reduce the deficit  not to grow jobs  not to invest in education  but to give another tax cut to folks like him  now  ask governor romney and his running mate when they're here in new hampshire on monday they're going to be coming here on monday ask him if that's fair  ask him how it will grow the economy  ask him how it will strengthen the middle class  they have been trying to sell this trickle down snake oil before   i laughter i  it did not work then  it will not work now  it's not a plan to create jobs  it will not reduce the deficit  it will not move the economy forward  it's the wrong direction for america  now  the truth is  i think they know it's not a very popular idea  you can tell that because now they're being dishonest about my plans  since they can't sell their plans   i laughter i  i mean  they are trying to throw everything at the wall just to see what will stick  the latest thing they've been trying is to talk about medicare  now  you'd think they'd avoid talking about medicare  given the fact that both of them have proposed to voucherize the medicare system   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  but i guess they figure the best defense is to try to go on offense  so  new hampshire  here's what you need to know  since i've been in office  i have strengthened medicare  i've made reforms that have extended the life of the program  that have saved millions of seniors with medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription drugs  the only changes to your benefits that i've made on medicare is that medicare now covers new preventive services like cancer screenings and wellness visits for free  governor romney and congressman ryan have a very different plan  what they want to do is they want seniors to get a voucher to buy their own insurance  which could force seniors to pay an extra   a year for their health care   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  again  this is not my estimate  remember those guys who analyze these things for a living  that's their assessment  that doesn't strengthen medicare  that undoes the very guarantee of medicare  that's the core of the plan written by congressman ryan and endorsed by governor romney  so here's the bottom line  my plan saves money in medicare by cracking down on fraud and waste and insurance company subsidies  and their plan makes seniors pay more so they can give another tax cut to millionaires and billionaires   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  my plan's already extended the life of medicare by nearly a decade  their plan would put medicare on track to be ended as we know it  it would be an entirely different plan  a plan in which you could not count on health care because it would have to be coming out of your pocket  that's the real difference between our plans on medicare  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  and i need your help  now    years ago  i promised to cut middle class taxes  that's exactly what i've done  by a total of about   for the typical family  so just like we've got a difference on medicare  we've got a difference on taxes  right now what i want to do is keep taxes right where they are for the first   of everybody's income  so if your family makes under   which that includes   percent of americans   i audience member i  that's me   i the president i  that's you   i laughter i  ninety seven percent of small businesses  you won't see your income taxes increase by a single dime next year  now  if you're fortunate enough to be in the other   percent  you'll still keep your tax cut on the first   you make  that's a pretty good deal  but all we're asking is for folks like me who make more than   we're asking that you contribute a little bit more above   so we can pay down this deficit and invest in things like making college more affordable  making sure our teachers aren't laid off  making sure our firefighters are there to respond to emergencies  making sure our economy grows  and keep in mind  asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more  that doesn't eliminate our deficit  we're still going to have to make sure that government does its part by cutting away all the spending we don't need  and i've already cut a trillion dollars in spending  and we've slated another trillion more  but we can't just reduce our deficit and our debt by gutting education and gutting research and development and gutting infrastructure  and all we're asking folks like me to do is go back to the rates we paid under bill clinton  which  by the way  was a time when we created nearly   million new jobs  the biggest budget surplus in history  and a bunch of millionaires to boot  see  i'm getting all fired up  now and i want to explain that this is not just good for middle class families and working families  it's good for everybody  because what happens when a police officer or a firefighter or a teacher or a construction worker or a receptionist what happens when they've got a little more money in their pocket   i audience members i  they spend it   i the president i  they spend it on basic necessities  so maybe they go out and finally  after   years  buy a new car  or maybe they buy a new computer for their kid who's going off to college  and that means business suddenly has more customers  and that means businesses are making more profits  and that means businesses are hiring more workers  who in turn have more money to spend  which makes businesses do even better  that's how you grow an economy  not from the top down  but from the middle out and from the bottom up  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president  on issue after issue  the choice could not be clearer  when the auto industry was on the verge of collapse  governor romney said let's  let detroit go bankrupt  i said  a million jobs are at stake  let's bet on american workers and american manufacturing  and   years later  the american auto industry has come roaring back  that's the choice in this election  governor romney likes to tout his private sector experience  even though a lot of that experience was investing in companies that were called  pioneers  in the business of outsourcing manufacturing jobs   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  he wants to keep on giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  i want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing here in new hampshire  here in the united states  hiring american workers to make american products to sell around the world  that's the difference in this election  governor romney thinks new sources of clean energy are  quote   imaginary  since i took office  we've in fact doubled the use of renewable energy like wind and solar  thousands of americans have good jobs because of it  it's not imaginary  it's real  new hampshire  we've got to stop giving   billion a year in taxpayer subsidies to big oil companies that are making plenty of profits and use that money to help american homegrown energy that has never been more promising  that's a choice in this election  in   i promised i would end the war in iraq  we did  i said we'd go after al qaida and bin laden  we did  we now are transitioning so that afghans take more responsibility for their security and we can start bringing our troops home from there  all of these things we did only because of the incredible courage and dedication and patriotism of our men and women in uniform  and that's why we've made historic investments in the va  because i believe that anybody who has fought for america in uniform should not have to fight for a job when they come home  shouldn't have to fight for the benefits they've earned   i audience members i  u s a  u s a  u s a   i the president i  so we could not be prouder of them  but we want them to return to a strong economy  which means that after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building here at home  let's create a veterans jobs corps that can help returning heroes get jobs as firefighters and cops in communities that need them the most  let's take some of the savings from war to rebuild our roads and our bridges and our schools all across america  to lay broadband lines and wireless networks that can make us more competitive  let's put some construction workers back to work  that helps everybody  and that will help america be strong for decades to come  that's the choice in this election  that's what's at stake  i want to make sure that we've got the best education in the world  i want to help school districts like this one hire and reward the best teachers  especially in math and science  i want to give   million more americans the chance to go to community colleges and learn the skills that businesses are hiring for right now  and i want college and universities to bring their tuitions down  because in the  st century  our young people have to be able to get a college education  a higher education  it's not a luxury  it is a necessity  that's the choice in this election  and yes  new hampshire  i'm running again because i still believe in america nobody should go broke because they get sick  i'm kind of fond of the term obamacare  because i do care  that's why we passed the law  that's why   million young people can stay on their parent's plan now  that's why seniors are seeing discounts on their prescription drugs  that's why families who've got somebody with a preexisting condition can now get health care  it was the right thing to do  the supreme court has spoken  we are not going backwards  we are going forward  we're not going back to the day when serving the country you love depended on who you love  we ended  don't ask  don't tell  it was the right thing to do  we're not going back  we're not going back to the day when women didn't have control of their own health care choices  we're going forward  we're not going back  on issue after issue  there is a choice  and all these issues manufacturing and health care and education all these things tie together because it's part of what not only makes up a middle class life  but also creates rungs of opportunity for people to get into the middle class  that's what we believe in  that's what we're fighting for  that's how the economy grows  that's what we learned from our parents and our grandparents and our great grandparents  some who came here as immigrants  folks working hard  overcoming obstacles  understanding that in america  not only could you do better  but your future generations could do better  that's what's at stake in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president  now  let me say this  let me close up by saying this  over the next   months  you will see more negative ads than you have ever seen in your life  these folks on the other side  they're writing   million checks  and basically  their argument is going to be the same one over and over again  the economy is not where it should be  and it's obama's fault  they'll just keep on repeating that because they know their own plans don't sell  so all they'll try to do is just hope that if they can tap into people's frustration and anxiety  that somehow they're going to win  even though what they're selling won't work  it's not a what they're selling is not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to reduce the deficit  it certainly is not a plan to revive the middle class  but they are counting on just outspending us to win  but here is the good news  here's the good news  new hampshire  i've been counted out before  and i've been outspent before  but what i've learned and you guys helped teach this to me is that when the american people  when they cut through the nonsense  when you focus on what's important  when you're reminded of what values built this country  when you remember that we are all in this together and you affirm the basic american notion that everybody in this country gets a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same set of rules  when you are focused on the things that make us a great country  we don't lose  you will help get us there  we've got too many more jobs we've got to create  too many more teachers we've got to hire  too many young people who need to go to college  too many troops we've got to come home  more energy we've got to generate  more opportunity that we've got to open up to everybody  so if you're willing to stand with me and fight with me and make phone calls with me and knock on doors with me  if you're willing to vote for me  we will win new hampshire  we will win this election  and we will finish what we started and remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  new hampshire  thank you   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  thank you so much  what a beautiful day in new hampshire  a couple people i want to acknowledge  first of all  thanks to your outstanding young mayor  t j  jean  and his folks  who are standing right next to him  they're pretty proud of him  he's doing a great job  please give amy a great big round of applause for the wonderful introduction  one of the national cochairs of our campaign and your outstanding senator  jeanne shaheen  is here  and congressional candidate carol shea porter is here  and all of you are here on a beautiful saturday  now  first of all  i've got to just say thanks to all of you for looking after malia and sasha while they were up here  they were here for a month at camp  and they did a great they just had a great time and enjoyed all the water sports  playing basketball and tennis  and arts and crafts  and  most importantly  there was some ice cream involved in the thing   i laughter i  they were quite pleased about that  so we missed them  though  parents  it's tough when your kids are away  isn't it  we've missed them so much  and they promised they'd write  and they did  and they'd just say   we're doing fine  bye   i laughter i  it's tough  but  anyway  i can see why they enjoyed themselves because new hampshire is one of the most beautiful states in the country  and we are just so pleased to be here  now  they didn't malia and sasha didn't get any tv when they were at camp  but   i audience members i  aww   i the president   i no  there's nothing wrong with that  that's good   i laughter i  but  unless you've been able to hide your television set  you may be aware that there's a pretty intense campaign going on right now  now  the reason it is so hotly contested is because the choice that we face this november couldn't be bigger  it's not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties  this is a choice between two fundamentally different visions for our country  two fundamentally different ideas about the direction that we should be going in  and the direction that we choose the direction you choose when you walk into that voting booth in november is going to have an impact not just on your lives  it's going to have an impact on your children  your grandchildren  and generations to come  now    years ago  we came together as democrats  but also independents and some republicans  because we knew we had to restore the basic bargain that built america  what made us an economic superpower  what created the greatest middle class we've ever seen  and it's a pretty simple bargain  it's the idea that if you work hard  you should be able to get ahead  it's a deal that says  if you put in enough effort and you act responsibly that you can find a job that pays the bills  you can afford a home that you call your own  you can count on health care when you get sick  you can retire with dignity and respect  and  most importantly  you can give your kids the kind of education and opportunity that allows them to dream even bigger and do even better than you ever did  that's the american idea  that's what we came together to fight for in   it's a simple american promise  and we knew it wouldn't be easy restoring that promise  we knew it would take more than one year or one term or even one president because we had gone through a decade in which that promise wasn't being kept   i audience member i  i love you  mr  president   i the president i  i love you too  sweetie   i laughter i  we had seen a decade  before i came into office  in which jobs were being shipped overseas  we had run two wars on a credit card  gone from surplus to deficits  wages and incomes actually went down during this period  even as the costs of everything from health care and college were going up  a few folks at the top were doing really  really well  but for a lot of middle class families  folks were working harder and harder and seems like if you were lucky  you were just treading water  and that was before the economic crisis  which hammered so many families all across this state and all across this country people losing their jobs  their homes  their savings  making the american dream even further out of reach  so when i ran   years ago  when we talked about how we were going to restore that basic bargain   years ago  i told you there were no quick fixes  there were no simple solutions  but what i said was if we were willing to work hard and we were willing to come together  i had no doubt we could meet every single challenge because we've got so many things going for us  we've got the best workers in the world  we've got the best entrepreneurs and small businesspeople in the world  we've got the best scientists and researchers  the best colleges and universities in the world  compared to other developed countries  we're a young nation  and part of it is because we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity  people still want to come here from every corner of the globe because they understand what america means  and so no matter what the naysayers say  no matter how dark the other side tries to paint things around election time  there is not another country on earth that would not gladly trade places with the united states of america  they understand  we understand  that here in america  if you're willing to work hard  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  you can make it if you try  that's what the last   years has been about  whether it's been saving the auto industry or getting health care passed or creating   million new jobs or making sure that young people have an easier time affording college  it's all about that idea of making sure hard work is rewarded  that's what my presidency has been about  that is what this campaign is about  that is why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  now  my opponent and his new running mate  they just have a different view of things  they've got wonderful families  they're good people  but they believe in a different vision  they think the best way forward is the kind of top down economics that got us into this mess in the first place  they truly believe that if you roll back regulations that we put in place to control wall street or if you get rid of regulations we put in place to avoid our air getting dirtier and our water getting dirtier and then if you combine that with more tax breaks for the wealthiest americans  then somehow prosperity will come raining down on all of you   i laughter i   i audience member i  that's why we're in a drought   i laughter i   i the president i  i'm not exaggerating here  you can go on their web site  look at congressman ryan's budget  the centerpiece of governor romney's entire economic plan is a new   trillion tax cut  a lot of it going to folks like me  a lot of it going to the wealthiest americans  his new running mate  congressman ryan  put forward a plan that would let governor romney pay less than   percent in taxes each year   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  that's a pretty good deal  just paying   percent in taxes  you're making millions of dollars  now  here's the kicker  they expect you to pick up the tab  governor romney's tax plan would actually raise taxes on middle class families with children by an average of   now  this is not my analysis  this is the analysis of independent economists whose job it is to analyze these plans  every media outlet checked on the numbers here  and their estimate is that it would cost you an extra   not to grow the economy  not to reduce the deficit  not to make sure that our schools are working well or we're building roads or we're strengthening the middle class  all this would be just to give another tax cut to folks like governor romney  it would give the average person who is making more than   million a year another   in tax cuts   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  governor romney and congressman ryan will be here in new hampshire on monday  so you can tell them if you think this is fair   i laughter i  and you should ask them  how do you think that's going to grow the economy again  how is that going to strengthen the middle class  look  we have tried this kind of trickle down snake oil before   i laughter i  it didn't work then  it won't work now  it's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to reduce our deficit  it's not a plan to strengthen our economy  it's not a plan to strengthen the middle class it won't work  we're moving forward  they want to take us backwards  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  the truth is  if you ask them or you ask their consultants  i think  they know their economic plan isn't really popular   i laughter i  and that's why they've got to be dishonest about my plan  they are just throwing everything they can at the wall to see if it sticks  their latest approach is to try to challenge me on medicare  now  let's just think about this for a second  governor romney wants to turn medicare into a voucher system  congressman ryan wants to turn medicare into a voucher system   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i  on the other hand  have strengthened medicare  we made reforms that extended the life of the program  saved millions of seniors with medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription drugs  we're closing the doughnut hole  the only changes to benefits that we made was to make the benefits better by making sure that medicare now covers new preventive services like cancer screenings and wellness visits for free  meanwhile  governor romney and congressman ryan want to give seniors a voucher to buy insurance on their own which  again  somebody did the analysis  not us  somebody else  and they estimate that this could force seniors to pay as much as an extra   a year for their health care   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  how many people think that's a good deal   i audience members i  nobody   i the president i  that doesn't strengthen medicare  it undoes the very guarantee of medicare  but that's the core of the plan that was written by congressman ryan and endorsed by governor romney  and if they want to talk about benefits  they should be straight with you  those new cancer screenings and prescription drug discounts  all those things we put into place with the affordable care act  those things would be eliminated if governor romney has his way  so it would take something away from seniors  and it wouldn't replace it with something better  so here's the bottom line  new hampshire  my plan saves money in medicare by cracking down on fraud and waste and making sure insurance companies aren't getting unfair subsidies  their plan makes seniors pay more so they can give another tax cut to rich folks who don't need a tax cut   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  my plan has extended the life of medicare by nearly a decade  their plan would shorten the life of medicare and end medicare as we know it because they turned it into a voucher system  so those are the differences between our plans on medicare  but that's just one example of the choice in this election  that's what's at stake  that's why i'm running  and you can see it on every issue  when it comes to taxes    years ago  i came before you and i said  middle class families need relief  especially during this crisis  i'm going to lower taxes on middle class families  guess what  i kept that promise  so if you start getting into an argument with your republican cousin or friend or what have you i laughter i you just tell them  look  the typical family is paying   less in federal taxes since president obama came into office  and right now  what i want to do is i want to keep taxes right where they are for your first   of income  now  that means  percent of americans make less than     percent of small businesses make less than   so under my plan  you wouldn't see your taxes  your income taxes  go up a single dime next year  that's a contrast with governor romney's plan  but in the interest of full disclosure here  if you're fortunate enough to be in the other   percent  you're still going to get a tax cut on the first   of income  you get to keep that  all we're asking is that you contribute a little bit more so that we can pay down our deficit in a responsible way and invest in things like education that helped us grow  and you'll hear some people say  well  just taxing the top   percent  that won't eliminate the deficit  it's true  government is still going to have to do its part in cutting away spending we don't need  and we've already cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending  and we're slated to do another trillion and a half under my budget plan  but we're not going to do it all on the backs of middle class families and gutting education and gutting science and research and no longer investing in our infrastructure  all we're asking is that folks like me go back to the rates we paid under bill clinton  which  by the way  worked out pretty good  we created   million new jobs  we had a surplus instead of a deficit  and we created a whole bunch of new millionaires to boot  and part of the reason it worked out pretty well  when a teacher or a construction worker or a nurse or a receptionist  when they've got a little extra money in their pockets  what do they do   i audience members i  they spend it   i the president i  they spend it on basic necessities  and that means  maybe that old beat up car you've been hanging on to for the last   years  you decide  all right  it's time to get a new one  or maybe you decide  you know what  our kids are going to college  let's make sure they've got a new computer  and that means  then  business has more customers  which means business gets more profit  which means they then hire more workers  which means those workers then have a little more money in their pockets  everybody does better  that's how you grow an economy  not from the top down  but from the middle out and the bottom up  when everybody is doing well  we all prosper  that's the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  on issue after issue  the choice could not be clearer  when the auto industry was on the brink of collapse  governor romney said  let's let detroit go bankrupt  i said  let's bet on american workers  and   years later  the american auto industry is back  governor romney likes to tout his private sector experience  except a lot of that experience is investing in companies that have been called  pioneers  of outsourcing  we don't need more outsourcing  we need some insourcing  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  like governor romney is promoting  i want to give those tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in rochester  right here in new hampshire  right here in the united states of america  with american workers making american products  selling them around the world  stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's what i'm fighting for  my opponent thinks new sources of clean homegrown energy like wind energy are  imaginary  that's what he called them   i laughter i  congressman ryan said they were a  fad  listen  since i took office  america has doubled the use of renewable energy  thousands of good american jobs have been created  it's helping us to reduce our dependence on foreign oil  that's not imaginary  that's real  we need to stop giving   billion of taxpayer subsidies to oil companies that are making money every time you go to the pump  let's give those tax breaks to producers of clean  renewable energy right here in the united states of america  that's a choice in this election  i'm running because i made a promise to you in   we'd end the war in iraq  and we did  i said we'd go after al qaida and bin laden  and we did  we're transitioning in afghanistan so we can begin to bring our troops home  all of this was accomplished only because of the incredible service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform  which is why we've already passed tax breaks for companies that hire veterans and we've made historic investments in the va  because my attitude is anybody who has fought for our country shouldn't have to fight for a job when they come home  so now  new hampshire  after a decade of war  i want to take some of those savings  and let's do some nation building here at home  let's take about half the money we're no longer spending on war  and let's put it to use putting people back to work rebuilding roads and runways and ports and wireless networks and broadband lines into rural communities  and creating a veterans jobs corps that can help returning heroes get back to work as cops and firefighters in communities that need them  that's the america we want to build  that's the choice in this election  i want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world  so i want to help local school districts hire and retain the very best teachers  especially in math and science  create   million more slots for americans to go to community colleges to learn the skills that businesses are looking for right now  and i want to keep working to reduce the cost of tuition for colleges and universities because a higher education is not a luxury  it's an economic necessity in the  st century  that's a choice we've got to make in this election  and yes  new hampshire  i'm running because i believe in this nation  i still believe you shouldn't go bankrupt when you get sick  i'm actually kind of fond of the term obamacare  i fought for that bill because i cared  because i cared about the     million young people who can now get insurance by staying on their parent's plan  i care about the millions of seniors who are now getting discounts on their prescription drugs and free preventive care because of what we did  i care about all those folks here in new hampshire and around the country with preexisting conditions who can now get health insurance because of what we did  the supreme court has spoken  this law is here to stay  we don't need to refight this battle for another     we're not going backwards  we're moving forward  we're not going to put we're not going to go back to the days when serving the country you love depended on who you love  we ended  don't ask  don't tell  it was the right thing to do  we're not going backwards  we're going forward  i believe women should be in charge of their own health care decisions  we're not going backward  we're going forward  on issue after issue  there is a clear choice  now  over the next   months  the other side is going to spend more money than we have ever seen  i mean  they are writing   million checks individuals just to run the same ad over and over again  it's variations on the same theme  which is  the economy is not where it needs to be and it's obama's fault  they'll just say that over and over again   i laughter i  and the reason they've got to say that that's their only message is because they know their economic plan won't sell  they may have a plan to win the election  but they don't have a plan to create jobs  they don't have a plan to grow the economy  they don't have a plan to help the middle class  i do  but here's the thing  i've been outspent before  i've been counted out before  but what gives me hope  what gives me confidence  is you  because i know when the american people start paying attention after all the ads have been done and they cut through all the nonsense and they start remembering the story of their families  their parents  their grandparents  all the struggles they went through  what it means to work hard and get ahead and overcome obstacles the same kinds of story i've got in my life as a son of a single mom  the same kinds of story that michelle has in her life  her parents  dad a blue collar worker  mom a secretary  we know what it's been like to go through hard times  but we also know what it's like to have hope and determination and resilience and to watch the next generation do better  and when you guys are focused on that idea  which is the essence of who we are  then all that other money  all that other stuff  doesn't matter  so  new hampshire  i'm going to need your help  we've come too far to turn back now  we've still got more good jobs to create  more good teachers to hire  more students to help to go to college  more troops to bring home  more homegrown energy to generate  more doors of opportunity to open for everybody who is willing to walk through them and work hard and put in the effort  and if you're willing to stand with me one more time if you're willing to knock on some doors and make some phone calls  talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors we will finish what we started  we will win new hampshire  we will win this election  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america  thank you "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  ohio  hello  crusaders  oh  it is good to be back in columbus  the sun came out for us  it's a good sign  it is fun to be back in ohio  and it is great to be here  i just want to acknowledge a few people  first of all  give steven a big round of applause  he was explaining to me what it's like being a bmx driver rider  and he said that he said  well i asked him  because i'd seen those guys in the olympics  and i said   it seems like you guys fall a lot   i laughter i  and he says   no  no  i learned how to fall on my shoulder  i said   well  is that good  he said   well  i broke my shoulder four times   i laughter i  so but he looks okay to me  he's doing great  a couple other people i want to acknowledge  your outstanding mayor michael coleman is in the house  there he is  and we've got congressional candidate joyce beatty is here  and all of you are here  how many students do we have here  you guys are excited about school starting up  everybody was saying yes except this one guy over here   i laughter i  i he was shaking his head  come on  man  it's going to be great  well  i am glad we've got some students here because i came to columbus today to talk about what most of the students here are doing every day  your education is the single most important investment that you can make in your future  and i'm proud of all the students who are here doing what it takes to make that investment  the long hours in the library except for this guy   i laughter i  working in the lab  being in the classroom even when your classes start a little earlier than you had planned because your education's never been more important  the degree that you earn from this university is the surest path that you will have to a good job and to higher earnings  it's the best tool you'll have to achieve what is the core promise of this country  the idea that if you work hard  your work will be rewarded  the basic bargain that says if you're willing to put in the effort  you can do well enough to raise a family and have a home that you call your own  have some security  put a little away for retirement  and most importantly  make sure that your children  your grandchildren can do even better and dream even bigger than you did  that's the hope that your parents had for you  that's the hope i have for malia and sasha  that's the hope that you'll someday have for your own kids  but here's the thing  this is about more than just your own success  now more than ever  your success is america's success  because when we invest in your future  we're investing in america's future  the fact is that countries that out educate us today  they'll be able to out compete us tomorrow  businesses are mobile in the  st century economy  they can locate anywhere  so they're going to create jobs and they're going to hire wherever they find the best educated  most highly skilled workers  and i don't want them to have to look any further than right here in columbus  right here in ohio  right here in the united states of america  and because the economy's changed  over the coming decade more than half of new jobs will require some form of higher education  it may not be a  year college degree  but you're going to need to have gone to a community college or a technical school to get the skills you need to get hired  and this is not breaking news to any of you  what's also not breaking news is the fact that higher education has gotten a lot harder to afford  it's gotten more expensive  over the past   years excuse me  over the past two decades  tuition and fees at america's colleges have more than doubled  the average student who borrows to pay for college now graduates with about   worth of student loan debt   i laughter i  what  that sounds low to you   i laughter i   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  i just said the average   i laughter i  for a lot of young people it's a lot higher  and that kind of debt means pretty tough choices when you're first starting out  it might mean putting off starting a family or buying a home or putting off chasing that great idea that you've got for a small business  when a big chunk of each paycheck goes towards paying off your loan debt  that's not just tough for middle class families that are trying to make it and young people who are trying to get started  it's also painful for the entire economy because that means that money you might be spending on buying a new home or doing something else with it  it's going to that check that you're writing every single month  it's not going to the local business  and i have to say  this is something michelle and i know firsthand about  i'm not speculating on this  because we've been in your shoes  neither of us came from wealthy families  both of us graduated from college and law school with a mountain of debt  when we married  we got poorer together   i laughter i  we combined our liabilities into one big liability   i laughter i  we paid more for our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month  and that went on for years  and then  once we had malia and sasha  we needed to start saving for their college educations but we were still paying off our college educations  now  keep in mind we were lucky enough to land good jobs  we had steady incomes  but we did not finish paying off our student loans until about   years ago  think about that  i'm not   i audience member i  you got an education   i the president i  i got an education  and it worked out pretty good   i laughter i  but the point i'm making is  i'm only standing before you because of the chance that my education gave me  so i can tell you with some experience that making higher education more affordable for our young people  it's something i've got a personal stake in  it's something that michelle has a personal stake in  we believe in it because we've been there and we know that unless you provide those rungs on the ladder of opportunity  young people who are more talented than we are may not get a shot  that's why i've made it a top priority of my presidency  and  ohio  that is something that is at stake in this election  that's part of the reason why november is so important  and i say this because putting a college education within reach for working families just doesn't seem to be a big priority for my opponent  a few months ago  just up the road  in westerville  governor romney said  if you want to be successful  if you want to go to college or start a business  you can just and i'm quoting here borrow money if you have to from your parents   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and when a high school student in youngstown asked him what he would do to make college more affordable for families like his  governor romney didn't say anything about grants or loan programs that are critical to millions of students to get a college education  he said nothing about work study programs or rising college tuition  he didn't say a word about community colleges or how important higher education is to america's future  he said  the best thing you can do is shop around   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  the best thing i can do for you is to tell you to shop around   i audience member i  that's it   i the president i  that's it  that's his plan  that's his answer to young people who are trying to figure out how to go to college and make sure that they don't have a mountain of debt  shop around and borrow more money from your parents   i audience member i  what are we going to do   i the president i  now  i've just got to i want to make sure everybody understands  not everybody has parents who have the money to lend  that may be news to some folks  but i laughter i it's the truth  so what governor romney is offering is not an answer  there's nothing a parent wants more than to give opportunities to their kids that they never had  and it's pretty painful for a lot of parents if they can't do that  but as we're fighting back from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  you've got a lot of parents who are out there struggling just to make ends meet  and i don't accept the notion that we should deny any child the opportunity to get a higher education  if they've been working hard  if they've got the grades  if they've got the determination to get a better future for themselves  i don't want them to be prevented just because their families were hit hard by a recession  that's not who we are  that's not what america is about  we give everybody a fair shot  think about all the discoveries  all the businesses  all the breakthroughs that we would not have made if we told every young person who has got the drive and the will and the grades to go to college   tough luck  too bad  you're on your own  we've always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of everybody who is willing to work for it  that's part of what makes us special  that's what keeps us at the front forefront of business and science and technology and medicine  and this dates back for decades  some of you know my grandfather fought in world war ii  when he came back  he had a chance to go to college because this country decided every returning veteran of world war ii should be able to afford it  my mother was able to raise me and my sister because she was able to get grants and work her way through school  michelle and i would not be here today without the help of scholarships and student loans  and i know steve wouldn't be here either  and neither would a lot of you  so in a  st century economy  a college education should be available for everybody  not just the wealthy few  whether it's a  year college  a  year program  higher education is not a luxury  it is an economic necessity that every family in america should be able to afford  and that's what's at stake in this election  it's one of the reasons i'm running for president of the united states for a second term  and i want   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i   and i want you to know that i have not just talked the talk   i audience member i  you have walked the walk   i the president i we have walked the walk  since i took office  we have helped more than   million additional students afford a college education with grants that go farther than they did before  the economic plan my opponent has would cut our investment in education by nearly   percent   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  it would cut those grants so deeply that   million of those students who we have helped would no longer get a scholarship at all  it would cut financial aid for nearly   million students a year  and keep in mind they're not making these cuts to create jobs  they're not proposing these cuts to pay down the deficit  governor romney is proposing these cuts to pay for a new   trillion tax cut that's weighted towards the wealthiest americans   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  does that sound like a better plan for america   i audience members i  no   i the president i  does that sound like a better plan for you   i audience members i  no   i the president i  a plan that says that we can't afford to help the next generation earn an education  but we can afford massive new tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires  a plan that says we can't afford our young people to offer our young people student loans because we've got to protect corporate tax loopholes  it's a vision that says we can't help young people who are trying to make it because we've got to protect the folks who already have made it  michelle and i are going to be able to send malia and sasha to college  we don't need an extra tax break  you do  their vision is wrong for moving america forward  it's not a vision you've got to accept  that's why november is important  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president  governor romney makes his time as an investor in the private sector the basis of his candidacy  that's how he says he's going to fix the economy   i was in the private sector  and his economic plan makes one thing clear  he does not think investing in your future is worth it  he doesn't think that's a good investment  i do  that's what's at stake in this election  that's the choice in november  that's why we fought to make sure the interest rate on federal student loans didn't go up over the summer  we won that fight  some of these republican members of congress would have allowed those rates to double  costing more than   million students an extra thousand dollars a year  i've said i want to extend the college tax credit that my administration created so more families can save up to   on their tuition over   years  they want to end that tax credit  that's the choice in this election  in   i promised we would reform a student loan system that was giving tens of billions of taxpayer dollars to big banks and lobbyists instead of students  there are plenty of folks in washington who fought tooth and nail to keep that system as it was  we kept at it  we won that fight  we used it to double grant aid for students  my opponent now wants to go back to the way things were  he wants to go backwards to the policies that got us into this mess in the first place  we're moving forward  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term  and  by the way  part of our job is also to make sure you don't need a ph d  to apply for financial aid in the first place   laughter  so we've put in place this new consumer protection watchdog  the consumer finance protection bureau  put in place and it's working with the department of education to develop a simple new fact sheet on student loans and financial aid so you can have all the information you need to make your own best choices about how to pay for college  we call it  know before you owe  know before you owe  that's a good idea  but my opponent wants to get rid of this new consumer protection agency and let for profit colleges keep preying on veterans and working families  that's one of the choices in this election  i want to make sure that america once again leads the world in educating our kids  training our workers  i want to make sure more of our students are prepared for college by helping our secondary and elementary schools hire and reward the best teachers  especially in math and science  i want to give   million more americans the chance to go to community college  learn the skills that local businesses are looking for right now  i've put colleges and universities on notice  if they can't stop tuition from going up  the funding they get from taxpayers will go down  we want to give them some incentive to start lowering tuition  that's the choice in this election  that's what we're fighting for  that's what you're going to be having to think about when you go to that voting booth in november  four years ago  i promised that we would end the war in iraq  thanks to the service and the sacrifice of our incredible men and women in uniform  that's what we've done  today  all our troops are out of iraq  we are beginning to bring our troops homes from afghanistan  but the key is making sure that they are getting the same good deal that my grandfather got when he came home from the war  so we've made sure to keep the post  gi bill strong so that everybody who has served our country has the chance to earn a degree  as long as i am commander in chief  i promise you we will care for our veterans and serve them as well as they've served us  if you fought for this country  you shouldn't have to fight for a college education or for a job or for a roof over your heads when you come home  so that's what we're fighting for  columbus  that's just one example  in the education arena  of what's at stake  now  over the next   months  the other side will spend more money than we have ever seen ever  i mean  they got folks writing   million checks    million checks  they should be contributing that to a scholarship fund to send kids to college  but instead  they are going to spend more money than we've ever seen on ads  and the ads all same the ads all say the same thing  which is  the economy is not where it needs to be  and it's all obama's fault   i audience member i  no   i the president i  see  look no  no  listen  they know their economic plan isn't popular  they know that gutting investments in education and science and infrastructure and voucherizing medicare  they know that doesn't really sell well  they know that it especially doesn't sell well when you're doing all those things not to reduce the deficit  but to pay for massive new tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires  they know that's not going to poll well  so they're betting on the fact that you get so discouraged that you decide your vote doesn't matter  they're betting every single   million check from a wealthy donor drowns out millions of voices at the ballot box  they're counting on young people sitting this one out  they say  well  you know what  obama's you know  he's grayer now  he's not as new and as fresh as he was in   so young people aren't going to turn out the same way  they're counting on you sitting on the sidelines and letting others make the choice for you  see  they don't have a plan to create jobs or strengthen the middle class  but this is their plan to win the election  but i'm counting on something different  i'm counting on you  i'm counting on the fact that when the american people focus and push aside all the noise and all the nonsense and they remember the fact that all of us  whatever success we've achieved  we've achieved because we worked together  because we made sure everybody has a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules  i'm counting on the fact that when the american people focus on what's at stake  you can't be stopped  and all the money the other side is spending doesn't matter  so i'm going to need your help  young people especially  i'm going to need your help  i need to make sure you're registered to vote at your current address  we've got staff and volunteers who are here who can help you do that before you leave today  and when you leave  i'm asking you to grab   friends  make sure they're registered too  and if you need more information  you can go visit the web site gottaregister com  that's not  got to  not  got to  it's  gotta   i laughter i  g o t t a register com  let's prove the cynics wrong  let's show them your votes count  let's show them your voice makes a difference  let's show them america better start listening to the voice of the next generation of americans  i need your help to keep this american dream alive  this incredible experiment we have in democracy  this idea that no matter where you're born or who your parents are or how much money you got or no matter what you look like or what you believe in  you can go as far as your talents take you  that dream that we can still  together  achieve great things  that you can pursue the happiness that you hope for and your parents hope for  that here in america you can make it if you try  ohio  we've come too far to turn back now  we've got more students who dream to afford college  we've got more good teachers to hire  we've got more schools to rebuild  we've got more good jobs to create  we've got more homegrown energy to generate  we've got more troops we've got to come home  we've got more doors of opportunity to open for everybody who's willing to walk through them  that's why i'm asking for a second term as president  and if you're willing to stand with me and vote for me and organize with me and knock on doors and make phone calls with me  we will finish what we started  we will win ohio  we will win this election  and we will remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president   i hello  reno  hello  hello  it is good to be back in nevada  well  listen  first of all  can everybody give alejandra a huge round of applause  she did a great job  we're very proud of her  she was outstanding  i also want to acknowledge a dear friend  a great friend of working people not just here in nevada  but all across the country  your senator  harry reid  is in the house  where is harry  there he is  it's good to see all of you  and let me just point out  every time i come here the weather is really good  i mean  you guys have a pretty good deal here  it is beautiful  and as we were flying in  we flew over tahoe  which i'd like to pretend that there's a big campaign event there i laughter i but i can't really pretend that that's the case  but it is wonderful to be in this state  it is great to be at truckee meadows community college  and i came here today to talk about what students are doing here every single day  your education is the single most important investment you can make in your future  that's true for alejandra  it is true for every single student here  it's true whether you are talking about a community college or whether you're talking about a  year college or university  and i'm proud of all of you who are doing what it takes to make that investment  not just the money  but also the long hours in the library at least i hope you're spending some long hours in the library i laughter i and in the lab and in the classroom  because it's never been more important  but the degree students earn from this college is the surest path you will have to a good job and to higher earnings  it's the best tool that you've got to achieve that basic american promise  that simple idea that if you work hard in this country  you will be rewarded  the basic bargain that says if you work hard  if you're willing to put in the effort  then you can do well enough to raise a family  you can own your home  you can put a little away for retirement  you won't have to worry about being bankrupt if you get sick  maybe you can take a vacation once in a while  and most importantly  you know that you'll be able to pass on to your kids more opportunity and the possibility that they can do things that you couldn't even dream of  that's what america is all about  making sure those doors of opportunity are open to everybody  that's the reason i ran for president  that's what my presidency has been about  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  here is the thing though  your education is not just important to you  it's important to america's success  when we invest in your future  we're investing in america's future  the fact is that countries that out educate us today  they'll out compete us tomorrow  we cannot afford to lose that race to make sure we've got the most highly educated  most skilled workforce in the world  and when companies and businesses are looking to locate  that's what they're looking for  and i don't want them looking any farther than reno  nevada  the state of nevada  the united states of america  we've got the best workers in the world  and i want to keep it that way  and your education is just getting more important  i'm not telling you anything you don't know  more than half of the new jobs over the next decade will require some form of higher education  and i don't think it's also any news to you that higher education is getting harder and harder to afford  it is tough for a lot of folks  over the past couple of decades  over the last   years  tuition and fees at america's colleges and universities have more than doubled  the average student who borrows to pay for college now graduates with about   in student loan debt  and living with that kind of debt means you've got to make tough choices  especially when you're first starting out  it may mean putting off starting a family or buying a home  it may mean you don't have enough savings to try to start that new business idea that you've got  when a big chunk of each paycheck goes just towards servicing your loan debt  that's not just tough for middle class families that are trying to make it  it's also not good for the economy  because it means you're not spending that money with local businesses  and i want you to understand i speak from experience here  michelle and i know about this firsthand  we didn't come from wealthy families  my mom was a single mom  michelle's dad was a blue collar worker  her mom was a secretary  michelle's parents never went to college  both of us graduated from college and law school with a mountain of debt  so when we got married  we pooled our liabilities  not our assets   i laughter i  we got poorer  not richer  in fact  we paid more for our student loans than we paid on our mortgage each month  when we finally were able to afford to buy a condo  and then  once we had malia and sasha  now we're supposed to be saving for their college education  but we're still paying off for our college educations  and look  we were luckier than most  we had landed good jobs with steady incomes  even with that  though  we only finished paying off our student loans about   years ago  now  think about that  i became president   years ago  i was a u s  senator about   years ago  so i had been working and michelle had been working for over a decade before we got all our loans paid off  but here's the thing  i'm only standing here before you today because of the chance that that education gave me  so i think i can speak with some experience and say  making higher education more affordable for young people is something i've got a personal stake in  it's not something i believe in abstractly  it's something michelle has a personal stake in  we believe in it because we've been in your shoes  we know what it's like  we understand that unless you provide those rungs on the ladder of opportunity  then young people many of whom are more talented than michelle and i may not get a shot  and that's why i've made this one of the top priorities of my presidency  it's part of what's at stake in this election  when all of you walk in to that voting booth in november  you're going to have a choice  and part of it is the choice of how we treat education in this country  and i say this because putting a college education within reach for working families does not seem to be a priority that my opponent shares  look  a few months ago  governor romney told a crowd of young people  just like you  that if you want to be successful  if you want to go to college or you want to start a business  then you can just and i'm quoting here borrow money if you have to from your parents   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  harry  did your parents have a whole bunch of money to lend you   i audience members i  no   i the president i  my parents didn't have a lot of money to lend me  i'll bet a bunch of your parents don't have a lot of money to lend  it's not because they don't want to  they don't have it  when a high school student asked governor romney what he would do to make college more affordable for families  governor romney didn't say anything about grants or loan programs that have helped millions of students earn a college education  he didn't say anything about work study programs or rising college tuition  he did not say a single word about community colleges or how important higher education is to america's economic future  here's what he said   the best thing i can do for you is to tell you to shop around i laughter i to shop around  so this is his plan  that's his answer to a young person hoping to go to college  shop around and borrow money from your parents if you have to   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  that's not an answer  that's not an not only is it not a good answer  it's not even an answer  there is nothing a parent wants to do more than to give their kids opportunities that we never had  there are very few things more painful than a parent not being able to do it  but we're still fighting back from the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes  there are a lot of parents out there who are working really hard  but still struggling to make ends meet  and i do not accept the notion that we should deny their children the opportunity of a higher education and a brighter future just because their families were hard hit by a recession  think about all the discoveries  all the businesses  all the breakthroughs that we wouldn't have had if we had told every american that wanted to go to college   tough luck  too bad  you're on your own   i audience member i  shop around   i the president i  shop around  this country has always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of all who are willing to work for it  that's part of what made us an economic superpower  that's what kept us at the forefront of business and science and technology and medicine  and this is not just a new commitment we've made  my grandfather had the chance to go to college because after fighting on behalf of america in world war ii  he came back to a country that decided  you know what  we're going to make sure every veteran should be able to afford college  my mother was able to raise me and my sister by herself and go to college because she was able to get grants and work her way through school  michelle and i would not be here without the help of scholarships and student loans  we are only here because the chance our education gave us  and i want every young person to have that chance  and listen  government can't help folks who won't help themselves  parents have to parent  and young people have to stay disciplined and focused  but if you're willing to work hard  a college education in the  st century should be available to everybody  not just the wealthy few  that's what i believe  whether it's a  year education  a  year program  higher education is not a luxury  it is a necessity  and every american family should be able to afford it  that's what's at stake in this election  it's one of the reasons i'm running for president  since and listen  i want you to understand  i'm not just talking the talk  i'm not just making promises  since i took office  we've helped over   million more students afford a college education with grants that go farther than they did before  now  unfortunately  the economic plan of governor romney could cut our investments in education by about   percent  so the grants that we've used that alejandra may be taking advantage of  many of you may be taking advantage of those grants could be cut so deeply that   million of the students who've been helped  would no longer get scholarships  it would cut financial aid for nearly   million students a year  now and here's the worst part  they're not making these cuts to reduce the deficit  they're not making these cuts so they can create more jobs  they're doing it to pay for a new   trillion tax cut weighted towards the wealthiest americans   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  does that sound like a plan for a better future for you   i audience members i  no   i the president i  it's a plan that says we can't afford to help the next generation  but we can afford massive new tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires  we can't offer our young people student loans because we've got to protect corporate tax loopholes  it's a vision that says we can't help young people who are trying to make it because we've got to protect the folks who already have made it  that's not a vision we have to accept  governor romney likes to talk about his time as an investor as one of the bases for his candidacy  but his economic plan makes clear he doesn't think your future is worth investing in  and i do  that's what's at stake in this election  that's the choice this november  we are going to make sure that america once again leads the world in educating our kids and training our workers  there are business owners across the country who say they can't fill the skilled positions they have open  and you've got a million millions of people who are out there looking for work  so i want to give   million more americans the chance to go to community colleges just like this one  to learn the skills that local businesses are hiring for right now  community colleges like truckee meadows educate the backbone of our workforce  this is where young people and some not so young people can come and get trained as nurses and firefighters and computer programmers and folks who manufacture clean energy components  and these are the vital pathways to the middle class  and we shouldn't weaken them  we should strengthen them  earlier this summer  harry reid and i  we fought to make sure the interest rate on federal student loans didn't go up  we won that fight  the republican plan in congress would have allowed those rates to double  costing more than   million students an extra thousand dollars a year  with the help of harry reid  we set up a college tax credit so that more middle class families can save up to   on their tuition over   years  governor romney wants to repeal it   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  in   i promised we would reform a student loan system that was giving tens of billions of taxpayer dollars to big banks and lobbyists instead of giving it to students  so they were taking a cut out of the student loan program even though they had no risk because the federal government was guaranteeing the loans    billion dollars' worth  so we said  no  let's cut them out  let's give this money directly to students  we won that fight  that's what we used to double the grants for students who are in need  my opponent is running to return the system back to way it was  he wants to go backwards to policies where banks were taking out billions of dollars out of the student loan program  he wants to go back to policies that got us into this mess in the first place  that is the choice in this election  i want to move forward  he wants to go backwards  we are not going to let him  that's what's at stake in this election   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  four years ago  i promised we'd end the war in iraq  and we promised we'd go after al qaida and bin laden  we promised to blunt the momentum of the taliban and then start turning over security responsibilities to the afghans so we can start bringing our troops home  we are keeping these promises because of the tremendous sacrifice of our men and women in uniform  so today  all of our troops are out of iraq  and we are winding down the war in afghanistan  but we've got to make sure that we keep faith with those folks who fought for us  so we've made sure to keep the post  gi bill strong  everybody who has served this country should have a chance to get their degree  and as long as i am commander in chief  this country will care for our veterans and serve them as well as they have served us  nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or fight for a college education or fight for a roof over their heads when they come home  that's part of what's at stake in this election  now  i have to tell you  over the course of the next   months  the other side will not talk much about education  because they don't really have a plan  they won't be talking about much  but they will spend more money than we've ever seen on ads that just try to repeat the same thing over and over again  the economy is not doing as well as it should  and it's all obama's fault   i laughter i  it's like going to a concert  and they just keep on playing the same song over and over again   i laughter i  and the reason they've got to try to just repeat that over and over again is because they know their economic plan is not popular  they know that the american people are not going to buy another   trillion tax cut  most of which goes to wealthy americans and that will be paid for by you   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  they know gutting education to pay for a massive new tax cut for millionaires and billionaires is not going to sell  so since they can't advertise their plan  they're going to bet on the fact that you get discouraged  that you get cynical  that you decide your vote doesn't matter  they're betting that each   million check from some wealthy donor drowns out millions of voices  they don't see that as a problem  that's their strategy  i'm counting on something different  i'm counting on you  see  part of what you taught me in   is that when the american people join together  they can't be stopped  when we remember our parents and our grandparents and great grandparents and all the sacrifices they made and we're reminded that this country has always risen and fallen together  when we remember that what makes us special is the idea that everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules  when that's our focus  you can't be stopped  so here's what i'm going to need from everybody  first of all  you've got no excuse not to register to vote  we've got staff and volunteers who are here  they will grab you at the door  you won't be able to escape  this young lady right here  she's ready to register some voters  and if somehow we miss you  or if you decide you want to help your friends and your neighbors and fellow students to get registered  you can do it online at gottaregister com  now  i want i know this is an educated place  but  gotta  is spelled g o t t a   i laughter i  this is gottaregister com  so you've got to you've  gotta  not just register  you  gotta  grab some friends  you  gotta  grab some neighbors  you  gotta  take them to the polls  you  gotta  vote  let's prove the cynics wrong one more time  let's show them your vote counts  let's prove your voice is more powerful than lobbyists and special interests  let's keep the promise of this country alive  that no matter what you look like or where you come from  you can make it if you try  we've come too far to turn back now  we've got more students to educate  more teachers to hire  more troops to bring home  more schools to rebuild  more good jobs to create  more homegrown energy to generate  more doors of opportunity to open for everybody who's willing to work hard  and if you'll stand with me like you did in   if you're willing to do some work and knock on doors and make phone calls  we will win washoe county  we will win nevada  we will win this election  we'll finish what we started and remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  cyclones  thank you  oh  it is good to be back in iowa  please give mischa a big round of applause for the great introduction   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  and i'm glad to be here  you guys look pretty cheerful being back at school  that's good to know   i applause i  yes  sort of   i laughter i  well listen  before i begin  i think it's important to say that our thoughts are with our fellow americans down on the gulf  they're preparing for   i at this point  an audience member hollered i   i the president   i the new orleans guy right here   i laughter i  they're obviously preparing for a big storm  hurricane isaac  and we've been getting ready for this storm for days  we've got response teams and supplies in place  america will be there to help folks recover no matter what this storm brings  because when disaster strikes  we're not democrats or republicans first  we are americans first  we are one family  we're one family  and we help our neighbors in need  now  it is great to be back in ames  class is in session   i laughter i  i didn't hear as many cheers  come on   i applause i  whew   i laughter i  cyclones football kicks off at home this saturday  i won't pretend i can give a speech like coach rhoads can  but i'm going to try  because just over   months from now  for the first time in most of your lives  you will get a chance to pick a president  and the truth is you've got more at stake in this election than just about anybody  when you step into that voting booth  the choice you make in that one instant is going to shape your country and your world for decades to come  and i know that's a pretty heavy idea to lay on you on a tuesday   i laughter i  but it's true  the decisions we make as a country on big issues like the economy and jobs and taxes and education and energy and war and climate change  all these decisions will directly affect your life in very personal ways  and i've got to say  this is something i'm acutely aware of when i make these decisions  because they're decisions that are going to affect malia and sasha  my daughters  as well  it's the way it's always been  one generation makes decisions on behalf of the next  but here's the thing  cyclones  your generation chooses which path we take as a country  your vote decides where we go from here  will we make sure that more good jobs and opportunity take root not in china or india or germany  but right here in iowa and all across america  so you don't have to leave home to get those good paying jobs  are we going to reward an honest day's work with the chance to buy a home of your own  with health care that's there for you when you get sick  with the ability to put a little away for your retirement  are we going to make it easier for you to afford your degree and pay off your student loan debt  are we going to build more good schools and hire more good teachers so that our kids are prepared to attend colleges like iowa state  and prepared for the  st century workforce  will this be a country that keeps moving away from foreign oil and towards renewable sources of energy like wind and solar and biofuels  energy that makes our economy more secure  but also makes our planet more secure  will this be a country that leads not just by the strength of our military  but the power of our diplomacy and the power of our example  will this be an america where no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter who you love  you can pursue your own happiness and you can make it here in america if you try  that's the question  that's what the last   years have been about  that's what this campaign is about  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  listen  i know it's easy to get fed up with campaigns and politics  sometimes it seems it's meaner and smaller and more gridlocked than ever  and every day  there's a steady stream of cynics who will tell you nothing really changes  you can't make a difference  you won't be able to close the gap between life as it is and life as you want it to be  old folks will always tell you that  and i'm in that category now   i laughter i  and frankly  some folks  they make it their political strategy to try to make you feel discouraged  they'll tell you over and over again how bad everything is  and then  of course  they'll add that it's all obama's fault   i laughter i  and they'll tell you that if you believed in change   years ago  your faith was foolish and you were being naive  last week  my opponent's campaign went so far as to write you off as a  lost generation  that's you according to them   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and what they hope is that by telling you these things  you'll get discouraged  and you'll just stay home this time   i audience members i  no   i the president i  but you can't believe it  i don't believe it  we knew that solving our biggest problems were going to take more than one year  or one term  or even one president  but we went ahead and we got started  we know we've still got a lot of work to do to get to where we need to be  but we are going to get there  i believe that because i believe in you  as tough as times have been  you're tougher  i've seen your passion  i've seen your service  i've seen your generation eager and impatient to make a difference  and already  you've proved that you can  think about it    years ago  you believed we could put a college education within the reach of all who were willing to work for it  so we created a college tax credit that's saving families up to   for college tuition over   years  we took on a student loan system that was giving billions of taxpayer dollars to big banks  and we said let's give the money directly to students  and we doubled grant aid for millions of students  we just won the fight to keep federal student loans from doubling for more than   million students  that would not have happened in washington except for you  your vote did that  you made that change  you helped millions of young people and maybe yourself get the kind of college education you deserve  don't believe them when they tell you you can't make a difference  you believed   years ago that we could use less foreign oil and reduce the carbon pollution that threatens our planet  and in just   years  we've doubled doubled the generation of clean  renewable energy like wind and solar  we developed new fuel standards so that your car will get nearly   miles per gallon by the middle of the next decade  that's going to save you money at the pump  that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a level roughly equivalent to a year's worth of emissions from all the cars in the world  today  america is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly   years  we're on track to emit fewer greenhouse gases this year than we have in nearly   years  you can keep those trends going  you believed in america  and that's what's brought about change  you believed that nobody should go broke in america just because they get sick  i believe that too  what the other side calls obamacare i've kind of grown to like the term obamacare   i laughter i  i do care  i care about folks with preexisting conditions  i care about kids who don't have insurance  and so today  because of the new health care law  nearly   million young people  including some of you in this audience  have been able to stay on your parent's plan  your grandparents are saving money on their medicine  women have gained access to free preventive care like mammograms and contraception  your vote made that happen  you made that change  it was young people like you that said we could end the war in iraq  today  that war is over  as promised  more troops are home with their families  earning their educations through the post  gi bill  starting new businesses  and no one will ever again have to hide who they love in order to serve the country they love because your vote ended  don't ask  don't tell  once and for all  you made that change  so the point is  ames  your vote matters  your vote made a difference  change was possible because of you  and now we've got more work to do  to grow this economy  create good jobs  to strengthen the middle class  and in november  your voice will matter more than it ever has before  this week in tampa  my opponents will offer you their agenda  it should be a pretty entertaining show   i laughter i  it will be  and i'm sure they'll have some wonderful things to say about me   i laughter i   i audience member i  we do   i laughter i   i the president i  but what you won't hear from them is a path forward that meets the challenges of our time  instead  it will be an economic plan that says if you just give folks making   million or more a year another   tax cut  then jobs and prosperity will magically rain down on everybody else   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  some of you guys are a little young  so you may not remember it  but we tried this for   years before i was elected  it didn't work out so well  it didn't work out then  it won't work now  i don't want to pay for another millionaire's tax cut by raising taxes on the middle class  i don't want to pay for that tax cut by cutting financial aid on   million students  our economic strength doesn't come from the top down  it comes from students and workers and a growing  thriving middle class  that's how we grow an economy  so in just over   months  you will make a choice about which path we take  and it's going to be a stark choice  you can choose whether we give massive new tax cuts to folks who've already made it or whether we're going to keep taxes low for every american who's still trying to make it  i've cut taxes for the middle class  and for families  and for students  and i want to make sure that taxes aren't raised a dime on your family's first   of income  that means that   percent of americans and   percent of small businesses wouldn't see an income tax increase  you can choose  you can choose whether we're going to give up new jobs and new industries to china and india or whether we're going to fight for those jobs by investing in the research of our scientists and the drive of our students and the innovation that harnesses new sources of energy and brings the next generation of manufacturing to places like ames and milwaukee and detroit and pittsburgh  that's your choice  you can decide whether the best way to make college affordable is to as my opponent put it hope your parents can just lend you the money   i laughter i  or you can say  let's help more americans earn the kind of education you receive here at iowa state  let's help more americans go to community colleges to get the skills and trainings that employers are looking for right now  let's help more iowans learn to be leaders at the harkin public policy institute that a cyclone alum and your great senator  tom harkin  is setting up  he's working along with your new president  steven leath  doing a great job  and as mischa mentioned  although i am getting gray  i still remember what it was like for you guys  because michelle and i finished paying off our loans just   years ago  we know what it's like  we shouldn't make it harder  we should make it easier  we shouldn't end the college tax credit we created  we should extend it  because in america  higher education isn't a luxury  it's an economic necessity that every family should be able to afford  that's the choice in this election  you can choose an energy plan written by and for big oil companies   i audience member i  no   i the president i  that's what my opponent's offering  or you can choose an all of the above energy strategy for america  renewable sources of energy  governor romney called those  imaginary  congressman ryan said they're a  fad   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  let me tell you something  they need to come to iowa  because they're the future  they're worth fighting for  nearly   good iowa jobs depend on the wind industry  it's time to stop giving   billion of taxpayer subsidies to oil companies that are making a profit every time you pump gas  let's give it to homegrown energy sources that have never been more promising  that's good for jobs  it's good for the economy  it's good for the environment  that's the direction we need to go in  but it's all up to you  it's up to you whether we go back to a health care system that let insurance companies decide who to cover and when  i think you it might make sense for you to choose to keep moving forward with the new health care law that's already cutting costs and covering more people and saving lives  governor romney promised that sometime between taking the oval office and going to the inaugural ball  he'd sit right down  grab a pen  and kick   million young people off their parent's plan by repealing health reform  day one  that's what he says he's going to do   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  maybe we should call his plan  romney doesn't care i laughter i because i do care  i do care  and this law is here to stay  now is not the time to refight the battles of the last   years  now is the time for us to go ahead and move forward  and i'll work with anybody who wants to make our health care system better  but i'm not going to stand by and let folks talk about how we should go back to the days when ordinary folks who are working really hard suddenly find themselves losing their home  losing their savings just because they get sick  they can choose to refight the battles that were settled   years ago or   years ago or sometimes in the last century  i think women should be trusted to make their own health care decisions  that's a choice that you've got to make  i think that students who are brought here by their parents as babies shouldn't be kicked out of the only country they know just because their parents were undocumented workers  that's my view  it's your choice  i don't think we should write rewrite the constitution to prevent gay americans from being able to marry the person they love  that's my view  it's your choice  the strength of our character doesn't come from shoving anybody to the sidelines  it comes from hearing every voice  harnessing every talent  realizing that here in america we are greater together than we are on our own  and this november  you get to decide  you get to decide the future of this war in afghanistan  governor romney said ending the war was  tragic  he doesn't have a plan to bring home the   troops who will come home from afghanistan next month  i said we'd end the iraq war  we did  i said we'd get bin laden  we did  today  all of our troops are out of iraq  we're bringing them home from afghanistan  and as long as i'm commander in chief  we're going to make sure that we serve our veterans as well as they've served us  because nobody who fights for america should have to fight for a job when they come home  but these are your choices  governor romney wants to pass a new   trillion tax cut targeted towards the wealthiest americans  that's not going to cut our debt  ignoring inequality doesn't make it go away  denying climate change won't make it stop  these things won't make for a brighter future  they won't make your future stronger  and so  in   months  you get to choose the path that will actually lead to a better future  you have the chance to prove the cynics wrong one more time  and the other side is going to spend these next   months they are going to spend more money than you've ever seen in your life  they will have an avalanche of attack ads and insults and distractions  and sometimes  they'll just how do i put it they will fib   i laughter i  and they've got   million checks from wealthy donors who like things just the way they are  they're counting on you young people to just accept their version of the way things ought to be  to just kind of leave the questions that affect your lives up to big oil and the insurance companies  up to politicians that decide what a woman can or can't do when it comes to her own health  that's what they're counting on  that's their strategy  i'm counting on something different  i'm counting on you   i applause i  i'm counting on you  those who oppose change  those who benefit from the status quo  they've always bet on cynicism  they always bet on complacency  but throughout america's history  they have lost that bet  and they're going to lose it this time too  and that's because of you  it depends on you registering to vote  it depends on you showing up to vote  it depends on you refusing to wait for the next person or the person next to you in class or the person in the next town or the person in another state  it's going to depend on you to close that gap between what america is and what we know it can be  because let me tell you  everybody else is waiting on you  when they see you register  they'll register  when they see you vote  they'll vote  and i'm asking you one more time to do what we did  what young people all across the state of iowa did   years ago  i'm asking you to believe  i'm asking you to believe  not in my ability to bring about the changes you want to see  i'm asking you to believe in your abilities  i'm asking you to believe in what you can accomplish  we've come too far to turn back now  we've got more work to do  we've got more young people to send to college  we've got more good jobs to create  we've got more homegrown energy to generate  we've got more good teachers to hire and more good schools to build  we've got more troops we've got to bring home  we've got more veterans we've got to take care of  we've got more doors of opportunity that we have to open up to every single person who's willing to work hard and walk through those doors  that's why i'm asking you for a second term  and if you're willing to stand with me and work with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls with me  and if you're willing to vote for me in november  we will win iowa  we will win this election  we will finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  thank you  everybody  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the

 and the leaves were turning  and had a little nip in the air  and i wanted to stay  but as usual  they had something else scheduled   i laughter i  so it is wonderful to be here   i audience member i  i love you   i the president i  i love you back  i'm thrilled to be here  i've got a couple of people i want to acknowledge  first of all  give haley a big round of applause for the great introduction  one of the finest governors in the country  john hickenlooper  his outstanding lieutenant governor  joe garcia  congressman jared polis is here  and the outstanding secretary of the interior and your hometown guy  ken salazar is in the house  so class is back in session  the rocky mountain showdown is this saturday  and like haley said in her introduction  we are giving the rams and the buffs a second chance to go at it this fall  we've set up a rocky mountain rumble to see which school can register more voters  and you guys can get a head start by registering right here  right now  we've got volunteers all throughout the audience  volunteers  raise your hands there  they've got their clipboards ready  they are ready to go  if you are not registered  get registered  if for some reason these outstanding volunteers miss you somehow  then you can also register online at gottaregister com  now  i understand this excuse me  english professors  but this is  gotta register  this is g o t t a register  this is not  got to register gotta register  and we need you guys to get your friends and your classmates and your neighbors to do it as well because this is important  look  just over   months from now  days for the first time in many of your lives  you'll get to pick a president  now  the truth is  you guys have more at stake in this election than anybody  when you step into that voting booth  the choice you make in that instant will shape this country  the world  your lives for decades to come  and i know that's kind of a heavy idea to lay on you on a tuesday afternoon  but it's true  the decisions that we make as a country on the economy and jobs and taxes and education and energy and war and climate change and the supreme court  these are all decisions that will affect you directly in very personal ways  and i feel that same sense of urgency because the decisions i make are ones that are going to affect malia and sasha  my daughters  for generations to come  and this is the way it's always been  one generation may make decisions  but they're making them not just on behalf of that generation  they're making them on behalf of future generations  and the thing is  colorado state  your generation can choose the path we take this country on  your vote will decide where we go from here  we and so as you prepare for november  you've got to ask yourself some questions  are we going to make sure that good jobs and opportunities take root not in china or india or germany  but here in colorado and all across america so you don't have to leave home to find a good job  will we reward an honest day's work so that people have a chance to buy a home of their own  and you'll have health care that will be there for you when you get sick  and you'll have the chance to put a little bit of money away for retirement and take a vacation once in a while and  most importantly  be able to give your children a life that's even bigger and better than yours  will this country make it easier for future generations to afford a degree  pay off student loans  are we going to build more good schools and hire more good teachers so that more kids are prepared to attend colleges like colorado state  will this country be one that keeps moving away from foreign oil and towards renewable sources like wind and solar and biofuels that make our economy and our planet more secure  are we going to be a country that leads not just with the strength of our military  but also the power of our diplomacy and the power of our example  will this be an america where no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter who you love  no matter what your last name is  you can pursue your own happiness  you can make it if you try  that's what the last   years have been about  fort collins  that's what this campaign is all about  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  i know that it's sometimes easy to get a little cynical about politics   i laughter i  campaigns seem meaner and smaller  and washington seems more gridlocked than ever  every day there's this steady stream of ads  and it's a diet of cynicism  telling you change is impossible  you can't make a difference  you won't be able to close the gap between life as it is and the life that we imagined for each other  and frankly  some on the other side  they make this a political strategy  they tell you over and over again how bad things are and  of course  how it's obama's fault   i laughter i  and they tell you that if you believed in change   years ago  your faith was misplaced  you're naive  last week  my opponent's campaign called you the  lost generation   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and they hope that by telling you these things that you'll get discouraged  and that you'll stay home this time  because they know that young people came out in record numbers   years ago  well  i'm here to tell you  don't listen to the cynics  don't listen to the naysayers  four years ago  we understood that solving our biggest challenges was going to take longer than one year or one term or even one president  but we went ahead  and we got started anyway  and we may have a lot of work to do  but we know the path we're traveling  we know where we need to get going  and we know we're going to get there  we understand that this country is moving forward  and i'm confident we're going to get there because i believe in you  i believe in the american people  i believe that as tough as times are  the american people are tougher  i believe this generation is full of passion and full of service  i've seen your generation eager to make a difference  whether it's in a homeless shelter or working on an environmental project  and you've already proved that you can do it  you've proved it  you proved it   years ago  four years ago  you believed that we could put a college education within the reach of everybody who was willing to work for it  and because of that faith  we were able to create a college tax credit that's saving families up to   for college tuition over the course of   years  we fixed the student loan system that was giving billions of dollars of taxpayer money to banks  we said let's give it directly to students  and we were able to double grant aid for millions of students  when some on capitol hill were ready to let federal student loan rates double for   million students  we said no  and you helped us  and we beat that back  that would not have happened in washington without you  that's what your vote accomplished  you helped millions of young people  maybe including yourself  earn a college education  you made that happen  you believed we could use less foreign oil and reduce the carbon pollution that threatens our planet  and in just   years  we have doubled the generation of clean  renewable energy like wind and solar  we developed new fuel standards for our cars so that cars are going to get   miles a gallon next decade  that will save you money at the pump  it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a level roughly equivalent to a year's worth of carbon emissions from all the cars in the world put together  today  america is less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last   years  we're on track to emit fewer greenhouse gases this year than we have in nearly   years  you can keep those trends going  that all happened because of you  you believed that in america  nobody should go broke just because they get sick  and today today because of obamacare and yes  i do care that's why we passed the law  nearly   million young people have health insurance because they're able to stay on their parents' plans  your grandparents are saving money on their prescription drugs  women have gained access to free preventive care like mammograms and contraception  your vote made that happen  you made that change  it was young people like you who said we can end this war in iraq  and today  the war is over  more troops are at home with their families  they're earning their education through the post  gi bill  they're out there starting new   and nobody will ever again have to hide who they love in order to serve the country that they love  because we ended don't ask  don't tell  once and for all  you made that change  you made that happen  your voice made a difference   i audience member i  you did   i audience member i  with your help   i the president i  i helped a little bit  but this change was because you put in the effort  you put in the time  you had confidence in america's future  so now we've got more work to do  to grow this economy  to create more good jobs  to strengthen the middle class  and in november  your voice is going to matter more than ever before  because this week in tampa  my opponents will offer you their agenda   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  that's the best response  vote  and get some of your friends to vote  now  look  the show in tampa i'm sure will be very entertaining  and i'm sure they'll have wonderful things to say about me  it will be well produced  they've hired all kinds of fancy tv producers  the only problem is  it won't offer a path forward  they've got an economic plan that says if you just give big tax cuts  trillion worth  mostly to wealthy folks so that   million somebody who makes   million a year would get another   in additional tax cuts   i audience members i  boo   i the president   i that somehow prosperity will rain down on everybody else  and some of you are a little young to remember this  but we tried this for a decade  it didn't work  it didn't work then  it won't work now  i don't want to pay for another millionaire's tax cut by raising taxes on middle class families  and i sure don't want to pay for a tax cut for folks like me who don't need it or folks like governor romney who needs it even less i laughter i by cutting financial aid for   million students  our economic strength doesn't come from the top down  it comes from students and workers  it comes from small business people and middle class families who are out there striving and hustling  because when they do well  everybody does well  when they've got money to spend  businesses have customers  and then they hire more workers  and then those workers have more money to spend  and everybody does well  that's how you grow an economy  from the middle out  from the bottom up  that's what i'm fighting for  that's why i'm running for a second term for president   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  so in just   months  you're going to choose the path we take  and i want everybody  when you're talking to friends and neighbors  just explain to them what's at stake  tell them you can choose whether we give massive new tax cuts to folks who've already made it or do we keep taxes low for americans who are still trying to make it  i've cut taxes for middle class families and for small businesses and for students  and i want to make sure that taxes are not raised a single dime on the first   a year income which  by the way  means   percent of families and   percent of small businesses would not see a tax increase  that's a choice in this election  because we're going to have to close the deficit  and the question is are we going to do it mr  romney's way or are we going to do it in a balanced way that says  yes  we cut spending we don't need  but we also ask everybody to do their fair share  we can choose whether we give up new jobs and new industries to other countries or whether we fight for those jobs in states like colorado and iowa and ohio  by investing in the research of our scientists  investing in the skills of our workers and our students  in the innovation that harnesses new sources of energy  that brings about the next generation of manufacturing in places like fort collins  that's what's at stake  you can make a decision as to whether we're going to keep college affordable  you know  governor romney has a suggestion in terms of you affording college  he says  borrow money from your parents  now  my suspicion is if your parents got it  they've already given it to you  but i don't think that's the path we should be taking  i think we've got to make sure that we help every single american earn the kind of education you're earning right here at colorado state  let's help more americans go to community colleges to get the skills and training that employers are looking for right now  you know see  maybe my opponent doesn't understand  but i do  because michelle and i  we just finished paying off our student loans about   years ago  we know what it's like  we shouldn't be making it harder  we should be making it easier  we shouldn't end the college tax credit that we created  we should be expanding it  in america  a higher education cannot be a luxury  it's an economic necessity that every family and every young person in america should be able to afford  that's what's at stake in this election  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  if your friends or neighbors are concerned about energy  you tell them  do we want an energy plan written by and for big oil companies   i audience members i  no   i the president i  or do we want an all of the above energy strategy for america  renewable sources of energy  governor romney calls them  imaginary  congressman ryan calls them a  fad  i think they're the future  i think they're worth fighting for  this university gets   percent of its power soon to be   percent from solar energy  about   good colorado jobs depend on wind and solar industries  it is time to stop giving   billion a year in taxpayer corporate welfare to oil companies that are making money every time you fill up with a tank of gas  and let's invest that money in homegrown energy that has never been more promising  that's the future  and in america  we seize the future  it's good for jobs  it's good for our economy  and it's good for the planet too  that's what's at stake in this election  ask your friends  ask your neighbors  should we go back to a health insurance system that lets insurance companies decide who and when they want to cover   i audience members i  no   i the president i  so if you've got a preexisting condition  you're out of luck  or should we keep moving forward with the new health care law that's already cutting costs and covering more people and saving lives   i at this point  the president sneezed i   i audience members i  bless you   i the president i  thank you  see  it gives me a cold just thinking about what they might do   i laughter i  governor romney  he's promised that somewhere in between his first day and  i don't know  the next day  he's going to sit down and grab a pen  and he's going to eliminate obamacare   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  this is what's called the  romney doesn't care  plan   i laughter i  kick   million young people off their parent's plan  raise prescription drug costs for seniors  tell folks with prescription or with preexisting conditions  you're out of luck again  i   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i do care  and i think that all of us care  because all of us at some point in our lives might need to get health care and we might not always be able to afford it  no matter how well we've planned  no matter how well we think we've insured ourselves  and when that happens  i want to make sure we live in a country where every single person knows that they can get the care they need and they're not going to have to lose their home or lose their savings because of it  we don't need to refight the battles of the past  the supreme court has spoken  we're moving forward  if somebody wants to help to improve our health care system i'll work with them  but i'm not going to leave millions of americans out in the cold  that's what we're fighting for  that's what's at stake in this election  on issue after issue  these guys seem to just want to go backwards  sometimes they want to go back   years  sometimes   sometimes   sometimes   this isn't the time to refight battles that we've already settled  in november  you can say that in this century  women should be trusted to make their own health care decisions  at a time when one of the biggest assets we have is the diversity of our talent and our ingenuity  it doesn't make sense for us to tell young people who have grown up in america  who have pledged allegiance to the flag  who have understood themselves to be americans  who want to serve in our military or attend our universities  that somehow because their parents were undocumented  they should be sent back to countries they've never even heard of  that's not who we are as a people  we're not going to go back and reinstate  don't ask  don't tell  like these other folks are talking about  we're moving forward  we don't need to rewrite our constitution to somehow say that people who love each other and aren't bothering anybody else  that somehow they cannot get married  that's not who we are  we go forward  we don't go backwards  we don't  we don't the history of this country has not been to see if we can exclude more people  the history of our country has been to gather everyone together  if you're willing to work hard  if you're willing to act responsibly  if you believe in that american creed  then you're welcome  we're part of a family  and we don't believe in sending people to the sidelines  we believe that the strength of our country  the character of this nation comes from hearing every voice  from harnessing every talent  from realizing that in america we are greater together than we are on our own  and this november  you get to decide whether that remains true  and it's not just about this country  when we think about internationally  america remains the one indispensible nation  issues of war and peace are ones where we've always got to be at the forefront  and so you get to decide the future of the war in afghanistan  governor romney says that me ending the war was  tragic   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  he's criticized me for bring   troops home from afghanistan next month  now  look  i take a backseat to no one when it comes to our national security  but i believe in making sure that we act smartly in how we deal with our national security  i said we'd end the war in iraq  we did  i said we'd go after al qaida and bin laden  and we did  by bringing our troops home from iraq  by bringing our troops home from afghanistan  we're going to be able to start doing some nation building here at home  and that's part of our national security  and by the way  as long as i'm commander in chief  those veterans who served us  we're going to have to serve them just as well as they served us  because nobody who fought for america should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  that's what we're fighting for  that's the choice in this election  i want to thank colorado state for being so good to our troops  so good to our veterans  helping them earn the opportunity that they have helped defend  and here's the bottom line  colorado  if the other side has its way and they pass this   trillion tax cut that's targeted towards the wealthiest americans  it won't create jobs  it won't cut the deficit  ignoring inequality doesn't make it go away  denying climate change doesn't make it stop  these things don't make our future brighter  they won't make your future stronger  and so the ultimate question is  will you choose the path that actually leads to a better future  you have a chance to prove the cynics wrong one more time  and over the next   months  the other side is going to spend more money than we've ever seen before  they will throw everything they've got and the kitchen sink  they'll just make stuff up if they have to  they're doing it already  and they will send an avalanche of attack ads and insults  they will try to distract you  and sometimes how do i put this nicely they will just fib   i laughter i  and it's backed by   million checks  i mean  they've got wealthy donors who like things just the way they are  they're counting on young people to accept their version of the status quo  to accept their version of the way things ought to be  to leave the questions that affect your lives up to big oil and insurance companies  and a bunch of men in congress  that's what they're counting on  and so i just want all of you to understand your power  don't give it away  not when you're young  if you're going to get cynical  wait till you get older   i laughter i  wait till you have a few bumps and bruises  but right now america is counting on you  and i'm counting on you  those who oppose change  those who benefit from an unjust status quo  they've always bet on your cynicism and complacency  but throughout american history  they have lost that bet  they're going to lose that bet this time because of you  because we've got a lot more work to do  you're going to have to register to vote  you're going to have to get your friends registered to vote  you're going to have to drag your friends to the polls  you're going to have to refuse to wait for the next person to do it  because somebody is waiting on you  they're waiting on you to bring about this change  they're waiting for you to lead  sometimes  your parents may be waiting on you  back in   part of the way we ended up winning was because we had a whole bunch of young people telling their parents  you got to get on board  it's time for change  yes  we can  fired up  ready to go  and i'm still fired up  and i'm still ready to go  because we've got more work to do  we've got more jobs to create  we've got more schools to build  we've got more teachers to hire  we've got more young people to send to college  we've got more troops to bring home  we've got more renewable energy to generate  we've got more doors of opportunity to open to everybody who is willing to work hard and walk through them  that's what's at stake in this election  and that's what's at stake right here in colorado because if we win colorado  we will win this election  if we win fort collins  we will win this election  we win fort collins  and we'll finish what we started  and we will remind the world just why it is that the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  virginia  go hoos  wa hoo wah  i still don't know what a wahoo is   i laughter i  but i know we've got some here today  it's is good to be back  i love coming to this pavilion  i want to thank mathias for the great introduction  give him a big round of applause  i want to thank my great friends  tom perriello and your next united states senator  tim kaine  so it is good to be back in charlottesville   i audience member   i i love you  obama   i the president i  i love you back  before i get started  let me just say that on the flight over here  i was on the phone with our fema director  craig fugate and janet napolitano  who does our homeland security  as well as some of the governors and mayors who are now being affected and are having to deal with hurricane isaac  and i think it's important for all of us because we know we've got some prayerful people here to just let people on the coast know our thoughts are with you  our prayers are with you  we are going to make sure that we are doing every single thing that we need to do to ensure that the folks down there are taken care of and have the support and the love of the rest of this country  because when things like this happen  there are no democrats or republicans  there are just americans  and we stand by americans in their hour of need  now  i know it's for me  it's great to be back in charlottesville  and this is an exciting time of year  class is back in session  come on  we need a little more enthusiasm  students  the football team has got a home game on saturday  and in just over   months just over   months from now for the first time in many of your lives  you're going to get to pick the next president of the united states  now  i know that there's some young at heart here who are not so young  like me   i laughter i  but let me just take a moment to speak to the young people here  you guys have more at stake in this election than anybody  when you step into that voting booth  the choice that you make in that one instant is going to shape your country it's going to shape the world for decades to come  i know that's a pretty heavy idea to lay on you on just the second day of class  but i laughter i but it's true  the decisions that we make as a country right now on everything from the economy and jobs and taxes to education and energy and war and climate change  all these decisions   i at this point  there was a disruption in the audience i   i the president i   all these decisions are going to be affecting your lives in very personal ways   i audience members   i four more years  four more years  four more years   i   i i the president i  thank you  listen  i couldn't really hear what those young people were saying  but that's good that they're getting involved  and but what i'm trying to tell you here is  don't just chant  you've got to vote   i applause i  you've got to vote  the decisions we make war  peace  the economy  the environment all those things are going to be decided  and they're not just going to affect you  they're going to affect malia and sasha too  my daughters  so this is how our democracy works  your generation is going to have to push the generations in front of you to make sure that they're making the right decisions  your generation will choose not just between two candidates or two political parties  but will choose the path that we take as a country  and it will affect your lives in very personal  profound ways  so you think about the questions that are at stake here  are we going to make sure that good jobs and opportunities take root in china or germany  or are we going to make sure they take root in charlottesville and richmond  right here in virginia and all across america  are we going to make sure that an honest day's work is rewarded so that somebody who really works hard  they can afford to have their own home  and they'll have health care when they get sick  and they'll be able to retire with dignity and respect  and most of all  they'll be able to make sure their kids are doing better and dreaming bigger than they did  are we going to make sure that not just you  but folks who follow you can afford to get a college degree and are able to pay off their student loan debt  are we going to build more good schools and hire more good teachers and make sure that our young people are prepared to attend colleges like uva  will this be a country that keeps moving away from foreign oil and invests in renewable sources of energy like wind and solar and biofuels that help our economy and make our planet more secure  will this be a nation that leads not just with the strength of our military  but with the power of our example and fidelity to our values  is that the kind of country we will continue to be  and most of all  will this continue to be an america where no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your last name is  no matter who you love  you can pursue your own happiness and make it if you try  that's what my presidency has been about  that's what this campaign is about  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  that's what tim kaine stands for  that's what tom perriello stand for  and i know that right around this time  before football season has started  there are some folks who get sick of politics  i understand that  sometimes the campaigns seem meaner and smaller  and washington seems more gridlocked all the time  and you've got a steady stream of cynics who are telling you change isn't possible  you can't make a difference  you won't be able to close the gap between how things are and how they should be  you were naive last time when you had all that hope and change stuff   i laughter i  and frankly  the other side  they've made this a strategy  they will tell you how bad things are over and over again  and they'll helpfully add that it's all obama's fault   i laughter i  and what they're hoping is that even if you don't vote for them because you know that what they're peddling doesn't work  what they do hope is  is that you get so discouraged that you just stay home   i audience members   i no   i the president i  that's what they're banking on  but i don't believe that  i don't think you believe that  we knew that solving our biggest challenges would take more than one year  or one term  or one president  we know we've still got a lot of work to do  but we are determined to get it done  we are determined to finish the job  we're determined to finish the race  and that's why i'm running for a second term  and you know what makes me confident is you  the american people have gone through some tough times  but the american people are always tougher  and this generation of young americans  i've seen your passion  i have seen your service  i've seen you eager to make a difference  you've already proved that you can make a difference  think about it  some of you did vote   years ago  and some of you  even if you were too young to vote  worked on the campaign  and you believed   years ago that we could put a college education within reach of everybody who is willing to work for it  that's what you believed  so we created a college tax credit that's saving middle class families up to   on college tuition  we fixed the student loan system that was giving billions of dollars to banks as middlemen  we said let's use that money to double grant aid for millions of students  we won the fight to prevent student loan rates from doubling for more than   million students  none of this would have happened if it hadn't been for you  if it hadn't been for the work that you did  if it hadn't been the faith that you had in your ability to make a difference  you helped millions of young people  maybe including yourself  to earn a college education  you made that happen  and that makes me believe  that gives me confidence  it gives me confidence about the future  four years ago  we talked about how we could use less foreign oil  reduce the carbon footprint that threatens our planet  and in just   years  we have doubled the generation of clean  renewable energy like wind and solar  we've created thousands of good american jobs because of it  today  we're less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly   years  we're on track to emit fewer greenhouse gases this year than we have in nearly   years  we can keep those trends going  and that is all happening because of you  four years ago  you believed that nobody in america should go broke because they get sick  today  because of the new health care law  affectionately known as obamacare because of that law  nearly   million young people are able to stay on their parents' health insurance plans  your grandparents are saving money on their prescription drugs  women have gained access to free preventive care like mammograms and contraception  thirty million americans will be able to finally have the security of health care coverage  you can't be barred because of a preexisting condition  you made that happen  that's because of you  four years ago  we said we'd end the war in iraq  we did  more troops are home with their families  they're earning their education  in some cases  with the post  gi bill  they're out there starting new businesses  but that's not the only change we made  because no one ever again will have to hide who they love in order to serve the country they love  we ended  don't ask  don't tell  you made that happen  the point is  virginia  your vote mattered  your voice made a difference  change was possible because you made it possible  so you can't get tired now   i laughter i  because we've got more work to do  we've got more work to do to grow this economy  we've got more work to do to create more good jobs and strengthen the middle class  and in november  your voice will matter more than ever  and listen  if you doubt that  then pay a little attention to what's happening in tampa this week   i audience members   i boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  vote  i mean  my opponents are down there  they're offering their agenda  and it's a pretty entertaining show   i laughter i  they've got wonderful things to say about me   i laughter i  but you know what's interesting is  you can listen very carefully  very hard  and you won't hear them offer a clear  serious path forward  you won't  i mean  they've got an economic plan that can be summed up very simply  they say that if we give a   trillion tax cut  which includes giving an extra   tax cut to people making   million a year or more  then somehow  prosperity is going to rain down on the rest of us   i laughter i  now  many of you were too young to remember  but we tried this for about a decade before i came into office  it didn't work then  it's not going to work now  i don't want to pay for another millionaire's tax cut by raising taxes on the middle class  i don't want to pay for that by cutting financial aid for tens of millions of students  our economic strength does not come from the top down  it comes from students and workers and small business owners and a growing  thriving middle class  that's who we're fighting for  and in just over   months  you can make a decision about which path we take  you can decide whether we give a massive new tax cut to folks like me and mr  romney  who don't need it he doesn't even need he needs it even less than i do i laughter i or whether we work to keep taxes low for americans who are still trying to make it  i've cut taxes for middle class families  and i want to make sure that taxes aren't raised a dime on your income tax for families' first   worth of income  that means  by the way    percent of americans would not see any increase in their income taxes  but that depends on how you vote in november  you can choose whether we cede new jobs and new industries to countries like china or whether we fight for those jobs here in virginia here in the united states by investing in the research of our scientists  investing in the drive of our students  and investing in the innovation that harnesses new sources of energy and brings new generations of manufacturing to places like charlottesville and richmond   i audience members   i u s a  u s a  u s a   i the president i  u s a  that's what we need  but again  you can't just chant  you got to vote  you will decide whether we can keep making college more affordable or whether we take my opponent's advice and just have your parents lend you money   i laughter i  see  i think that we should help more americans earn the kind of education you receive here at uva  we've also got to help more americans go to community colleges to get the skills and the training that employers are looking for right now  and i'll say this again  just so you know i mean it  michelle and i  we've been there  we know what it's like  we just finished paying off our student loans   years ago  think about that  we shouldn't be making it harder for young people  we should be making it easier for young people  we shouldn't end the college tax credit we created  we should be expanding it  higher education isn't a luxury  it is an economic necessity for every single american  you can decide that an energy plan written by and for the big oil companies will be best for america  that's an option  but i think that the kind of all of the above strategy that we're talking about  a strategy that includes more american oil and gas  but also more wind and solar  and sets new goals for efficiency and makes sure that we're getting energy and using energy in smarter ways  that's the key to the future  one of the things that we've done is develop new fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars will get nearly   miles per gallon  that's double what they are now  that means you've only got to dig into your pocket to fill up your tank half as often  but not only does it save you money at the pump  it moves us closer to energy independence  it reduces greenhouse gas emissions by as much as all the cars in the world emit each year combined  this is a smart thing to do  it's the right thing to do  and by the way  my opponent is against that  so you're going to have to make a decision  just yesterday my opponent called my position on fuel efficiency standards  extreme   i laughter i  i don't know   i laughter i  it doesn't seem extreme to me to want to have more fuel efficient cars  maybe the steam engine is more his speed   i laughter i  but i think that we set goals and we meet them  that's what we do as americans  listen  what's extreme about the idea that instead of giving   billion a year in tax subsidies to oil companies that are making a profit every time you pump gas  it makes more sense to keep investing  using that money to invest in homegrown energy sources that have never been more promising  that's not extreme  that's good for jobs  that's good for our economy  it's good for our planet  it's good for our future  that's what's at stake  that's what you'll decide  that's why i'm running for president  we could go back to a health care system that lets insurance companies decide who and when and what to cover  but i think we've got to move forward with obamacare  it's already cutting costs  it's covering more people  it's saving lives  governor romney has promised that sometime on his first day  he is going to kill obamacare  he's going to sit down  grab a pen now  this would mean that he by a stroke of a pen  apparently he thinks that he can kick   million young people off their parent's plan  he can make prescription drugs higher for seniors   i audience members   i no   i the president i  suddenly  folks with preexisting conditions are out of luck   i audience members   i boo   i the president i  he calls my health care law obamacare  i call his plan  romney doesn't care  he's running on the  romney doesn't care  platform  this law is here to stay  the supreme court has spoken  we're not going to refight the battles of the last   years  we're moving forward  that's what's at stake in this election  i'm telling you  on almost every issue he wants to go backwards  sometimes all the way to the last century   i laughter i  in november  you can say that in this century  women should be trusted to make their own health care choices  you can say that in this century  we don't think young immigrants who were brought here when they were children and understand themselves as americans and have pledged allegiance to the flag should suddenly be deported to countries where they've never been  you can say we shouldn't rewrite the constitution to prevent gay americans who love each other from being able to marry the people they love  you can reaffirm the strength of the american character  it doesn't come from shoving anybody to the sidelines  it doesn't come from kicking folks to the curb  it comes from hearing everybody's voices  harnessing everybody's talents  realizing that here in the united states of america we are greater together than we are on our own  that's what i believe  that's what i believe  that's what you believe  that's what's at stake in this election  this november  you get to decide about the future of the war in afghanistan  governor romney said that me ending the war in iraq was  tragic  he doesn't have a plan to bring home the   troops who will be coming home from afghanistan next month  he likes to talk tough  but he doesn't have a lot of details when it comes to these critical issues  and so what i have said not just to you  but most importantly  to those young men and women in uniform who are serving us every single day is that you will know where i stand  when i say i will end the war in iraq  i will end it  when i say that we will go after bin laden  we'll go after him  and when i said that as we bring our troops home  first from iraq  now from afghanistan  that as long as i am commander in chief  we will serve our veterans as well as they've served us  i mean it  because nobody should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home after they've been fighting for our freedom  so here's the bottom line  passing a new   trillion tax cut targeted at wealthiest americans  it won't create jobs  it sure won't bring down the debt  it will increase it  ignoring inequalities don't make them go away  denying climate change doesn't make it stop  looking backwards doesn't make our future brighter  it doesn't make your future stronger  in the next   months  you get to choose  and we've got a plan that will actually lead to a better future  and you can prove the cynics wrong one more time  but the other side will spend the next   months  spending more money than we have ever seen in our lives  an avalanche of attack ads and insults and distractions and sometimes they just make things up  but they've got a bunch of folks who can write   million checks  and they'll just keep on running them  i mean  somebody was challenging one of their ads they just  they made it up about work and welfare  and every outlet said  this is just not true  and they were asked about it and they said one of their campaign people said  we won't have the fact checkers dictate our campaign   i laughter i  we will not let the truth get in the way   i laughter i  think about that  they're counting on young people to just accept their version of the way things ought to be  they expect that you will not be paying attention enough or you will be distracted enough or you will be discouraged enough that you walk away  and that means big oil writes the energy bills  and the insurance companies write the health care bills  and politicians in washington decide what a woman can or can't do when it comes to her own health  and you know what  i think they're wrong  i am counting on you  i'm counting on you because those who oppose change have always bet on your cynicism they've always bet on a lack of hope and throughout american history  they have lost that bet  and they're going to lose that bet this time too  as long as you register to vote  as long as you're going out there to vote  as long as you're getting your friends to go out there and vote  i need you america needs you to close the gap between what is and what might be  we've got more jobs to create and more good schools to build  we've got more homegrown energy to generate  we've got more troops to bring home  we've got more young people to send to college  we've got more doors of opportunity to open to everybody who is willing to work hard and walk through them  and it all depends on you  so don't worry about letting me down  don't let america down  don't let yourselves down  go out there  register  stand up  and if you do  we will win virginia  and if we win virginia  we will win this election  and we will finish what we started  and you and i together  we'll remind the world just why it is the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  iowa  oh  it is good to be back in iowa   i audience member i  we love you  mr  president   i the president i  i love you back  that's why i'm back  oh  this is a great crowd  it's good to see my outstanding friends  tom harkin in the house  leonard boswell  tom miller  and can everybody please give lucas a big round of applause  not just for the introduction  but for his service to our country  and it is great to see all of you  we've got a spectacular day  college football is in the air  we will try to get you home in time to see the hawkeyes and the cyclones  i know we've got kickoff later   i laughter i  and although you guys got to see the nationals and chris cornell perform before i got here  i just want you to know that i could not appreciate them performing i could not appreciate more them performing for us  so please give them a big round of applause as well  now  iowa  this is our first stop on the road to our convention in charlotte  north carolina  but there was a reason for me to begin the journey right here in iowa  where it first began more than   years ago  because it was you  iowa  who kept us going when the pundits were writing us off  it was in your living rooms and backyards and vfw halls and diners where our movement for change began  and it will be you  iowa  who choose the path we take from here  now  last week  the other party gave you their pitch at the convention down in florida   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  now  it was something to behold  despite all the challenges that we face in this new century  what they offered over those   days was more often than not an agenda that was better suited for the last century  it was a rerun  we'd seen it before  you might as well have watched it on a black and white tv   i laughter i  if you didn't dvr it  let me recap it for you   i laughter i  everything is bad  it's obama's fault i laughter i and governor romney is the only one who knows the secret to creating jobs and growing the economy  that was the pitch  there was a lot of talk about hard truths and bold choices  but nobody ever actually bothered to tell you what they were   i laughter i  and when governor romney had his chance to let you in on his secret  he did not offer a single new idea  just retreads of the same old policies that have been sticking it to the middle class for years  they talked a lot about me  they talked a lot about him  but they didn't say much about you  and they spent even less time talking about what they planned to do  not just because they know you won't like it  but because you've lived through it and you can't afford to repeat it  see  it turns out that we don't think making the middle class pay for another budget busting   tax cut for folks making   million a year or more will magically translate into jobs and prosperity for everybody else  we don't think families will be better off if we undo financial reforms that are there to prevent another financial crisis or rules that are there to protect our air and our water  protections to make sure your health care is there for you when you get sick  we really don't think the best way to strengthen medicare is to give seniors a voucher that lives them leaves them to pay any additional costs out of their own pockets  iowa  they have tried to sell us these tired  trickle down  you're on your own policies before  they did not work  they've never worked  they won't create jobs  they won't cut our deficit  they will not strengthen our middle class  they are not a plan to move our country forward  we believe in something better  we believe in an america that says our economic strength has never come from the top down  it comes from the bottom up  it comes from the middle out  it comes from students and workers and small business owners and a growing  thriving middle class  that's what we believe  we believe in an america that doesn't let how much money you've got determine whether or not you can afford good health care or get a higher education  we believe in an america that leads not just by the force of our military  but also with the strength of our ideals and the power of our example  we believe in an america where no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter who you love  you can pursue your own happiness and you can make it if you try   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  that's what the last   years have been about  iowa  and that's what this campaign is about  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  now  this thursday night  i will offer you what i believe is a better path forward  a path that grows this economy  creates more good jobs  strengthens the middle class  and the good news is you get to choose which path we take  we can take their path  or we can take the path that i'm going to present  we can choose whether we give massive new tax cuts to folks who've already made it or whether we keep the tax cuts for every american who's still trying to make it  i have cut taxes by a total of about   for the typical family  and i'm now running to make sure that taxes aren't raised a dime on your family's first   of income  that's the path forward  but you're going to have to choose it  it will be up to you  you can choose whether we cede new jobs and new industries to countries like china and india or germany or whether we fight for those jobs in states like iowa  my opponent's experience he likes to talk about it has been investing in companies that often were called  pioneers  in the business of outsourcing jobs  and when his advice was to  let detroit go bankrupt  i said a million jobs were at stake  an iconic american industry is at stake  i'm going to bet on american workers and american manufacturing  and today  the american auto industry has come roaring back  that's the choice  unlike my opponent  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  i want to start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in urbandale and des moines  right here in iowa  right here in the united states of america  that's what we're fighting for  you can decide whether  borrow money from your parents  is an acceptable answer for a young person hoping to go to college or start a business   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  or you can say  let's make sure america once again leads the world in educating our kids and training our workers  let's help more young people go to college ready to learn  let's hire more great teachers  especially in math and science  let's help more americans go to community colleges to get the skills for the jobs they need right now  governor romney wants to end the college tax credit we created that's saving families up to   over   years in tuition  i want to extend it  in america  higher education can't be a luxury  it is an economic necessity and something everybody should be able to afford  that's what we're fighting for  iowa  you can choose an energy plan written by and for the big oil companies  or you can choose an all of the above energy strategy for america  at a time when homegrown energy is creating new jobs right here in iowa  when farmers are helping to create new biofuels  when once shuttered factories are churning out new wind turbines  my opponent wants to end tax credits for wind energy producers  he said new sources of energy like these are  imaginary  his running mate calls them a  fad  nearly   jobs in this state depend on the wind industry  these jobs aren't a fad  they are the future  and i think it's time to stop giving   billion in taxpayer subsidies each year to big oil companies that are making money every time you go to the pump  let's give some of that money to homegrown energy sources like wind that have never been more promising  that's the choice in this election  that's what we're fighting for  it's up to you whether we go back to a health care system that let insurance companies decide who to cover and when   i audience members i  no   i the president i   or whether we keep moving forward with the new health care law that's already cutting costs and covering more people and saving lives  now's not the time to refight the battles of the past   years  now's the time to move forward  this november  you get to decide the future of this war in afghanistan  governor romney had nothing to say about afghanistan last week  let alone offer a plan for the   troops who will have come home from the war by the end of this month  he said ending the war in iraq was  tragic  i said we'd end that war  and we did  i said we'd take out bin laden  and we did   i audience members i  u s a  u s a  u s a   i the president i  today  all of our troops are out of iraq  we are bringing them home from afghanistan  and as long as i'm commander in chief  we will serve our veterans as well as they've served us veterans like lucas  who got his education thanks to the post  gi bill because nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or an education or a roof over their heads when they come home  that's what's at stake in this election  on issue after issue  iowa  governor romney and congressman ryan will take us backward  but the story of america is about moving forward  and soon you'll get a chance to choose a path that will actually lead to a better future  but over the next   months  the other side will spend more money than we have ever seen on ads that basically tell you the same thing they told you at the convention  the economy is not doing good  and it's obama's fault   i laughter i  they know their economic plan isn't popular  go figure that raising taxes on middle class families to pay for new tax cuts for billionaires and millionaires doesn't go over that well   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  so that's not what they're going to talk about  they're counting on the fact that you get so discouraged by these negative ads that you decide your vote doesn't matter  you'll decide that you can't compete with   million checks from wealthy donors  i'm counting on something different  i'm counting on you  and i need your help  first and foremost  i need you to go to gottaregister com to make sure that you are registered to vote  now  this is  gotta register  it's i'm sorry  any english teachers who are in the room  this is i laughter i it's not  got to  it is  gotta  g o t t a register com  and once you're registered  then you got to go to gottavote com that's g o t t a vote com to find out how to cast your ballot early  because in iowa  you don't have to wait until november   to vote  you can be among the very first to vote in this election  starting september   that's gottaregister com and gottavote com  because we got a lot more work to do  we  gotta  lot more work to do   i laughter i  we've got more good jobs to create  we've got more homegrown energy to generate  we've got more young people to send to college  we've got more good teachers to hire  and we've got more good schools to build  we've got more troops we've got to bring home  we've got more veterans we got to take care of  we've got more doors of opportunity to open to every single american who's willing to work hard and work through them  we've come too far to turn back now  that's why i'm asking for a second term  iowa  and if you're willing to stand with me and join with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls with me  and if you're willing to vote for me in november  we will win polk county again  we will win iowa again  we will win this election  we will finish what we started  and we will remind the world just why it is that the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  how's it going  iowa  it is good to be back in sioux city  please give rob a big round of applause for that great introduction  it's good to be with my outstanding secretary of agriculture  your former governor  tom vilsack  it is great to see your mayor  bob scott  and it is great to see all of you  and the only thing that i'm not going to do  though  is get in the middle of an argument between hawkeye and huskers fans   i laughter i  i'm not going to go there  now  iowa is our first stop this week on the road to our convention in charlotte  north carolina  and it was important for me to begin that journey right here in iowa because this is where it all began for us   years ago  right here in iowa  because it was you  iowa  who kept us going when all the pundits had written us off  it was in your living rooms and backyards and vfw halls and diners where our movement for change began  and it will be you  iowa  who is going to make all the difference in the world in this upcoming election  now  last week  the other party  they gave their pitch at the convention in florida   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  and i've got to say  that convention  it was something   i laughter i  despite all the challenges that we face in this new century  what they offered over their   days was an agenda that was probably a little better suited for the last century  they were going so far backwards you might as well have watched it on black and white tv   i laughter i  put some rabbit ears on the convention hall  now  in case you didn't dvr it  let me give you a simple recap  the economy's not where it needs to be  and it's obama's fault  and only mitt romney knows the secret to creating jobs and growing the economy   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and there was a lot of talk about speaking  hard truths  and making  bold choices  but the interesting thing was nobody ever bothered throughout the   days to tell you what these tough choices were going to be  they didn't really explain what they were going to do  when governor romney had his chance to let you in on his secret sauce i laughter i he didn't offer you a single new idea  it was just a retread of the same old policies that have been sticking it to the middle class for years  so you heard them talk a lot about me  you heard them talk a lot about mitt  they didn't talk a lot about you  they didn't talk about the challenges you face and how we could actually solve some of these challenges  they spent less time talking about their plan than just about anything else  not just because they know you don't like it now  the truth is if i had their plan  i probably wouldn't talk about it a lot either   i laughter i  and they know you're not going to buy it because you we tried it  you saw what happened  you lived through it  and you don't want to repeat it  we know that making the middle class  for example  pay for another budget busting   tax cut for folks making   million a year or more is not going to translate into jobs and prosperity for working families all across sioux city  we know that  we know that families aren't going to be better off if we roll back financial reform that's there to prevent another financial crisis  we know we're not going to be better off if suddenly we roll back the protections for our air and our water and protections to make sure that if you get sick  there's going to be health care there for you  we're sure not going to be better off if suddenly  instead of having medicare that you can count on  we've got some sort of voucher program that mr  romney and mr  ryan are proposing that leaves seniors to pay any additional costs out of their own pocket   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  they have been trying to sell us these tired  trickle down  you're on your own policies before  they did not work  they didn't work then  they won't work now  they won't create jobs  they won't lower our deficit  they're not going to strengthen the middle class  they're not a plan to move our country forward  we believe in something better  we believe in an america that says our economic strength has never come from the top down  it comes from the middle out and the bottom up  it comes from students and workers and small businesspeople  and a growing  thriving middle class  that's what built this country  we believe in an america that doesn't let how much money you've got determine whether or not you can afford good health care or send your kids to get a good higher education  we believe in an america that maintains the strongest  most disciplined  most effective military in the history of the world  but that we also lead with the strength of our ideas and the power of our example  and we believe in an america where no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or who you love  you can pursue your own happiness and you can make it if you try  that's what we believe here in america  that's what these last   years have been about  that's what this campaign's about  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  on thursday night this coming thursday night  not last thursday night i laughter i this coming thursday night  i will offer you what i believe is a better path forward  a path that will grow this economy and create more good jobs and strengthen our middle class and create ladders for everybody who is willing to work hard to get into the middle class  and the good news is you're going to get to choose which path we take  i mean  you can go with what you heard last thursday   i audience members i  no   i the president i  you can choose their plan to give massive new tax cuts to folks who've already made it  or you can go with my plan  which is to keep the tax cuts on every american who is still trying to make it  back in   i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  and i've cut taxes by a total of about   for the typical family  and now i'm running to make sure that taxes aren't raised a single dime on your family's first   of income which  by the way  means for   percent of americans and   percent of small businesses  they won't see their income taxes go up  that's my path  that's a different choice than where these other guys want to go  you can choose whether we give up new jobs and new industries to china and india and germany and other countries  or whether we fight to keep those jobs here in iowa  my opponent's experience he likes to talk about his private sector experience well  a lot of it was investing in companies that were called  pioneers  in the business of outsourcing jobs  i don't believe in outsourcing  i believe in insourcing  when the america auto industry was about to go under  he said   let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i bet on american workers and american manufacturing  which is why the american auto industry has come roaring back  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to start reward companies that are creating jobs right here in sioux city  right here in iowa  right here in the united states of america  that's the path i want to travel on  and at a moment when homegrown energy is creating new jobs all across this state and other states across the midwest  my opponent would put those jobs at risk the jobs that rob was talking about he'd put them at risk by ending tax credits for wind energy producers  rob told you  he said these new sources of energy are  imaginary  and mr  ryan called them a  fad  you just saw rob  he looks pretty real to me   i laughter i  he didn't i wasn't imagining him up here talking  was i   i laughter i  he's been in the wind energy business for nearly   years  he and his wife tara now have   employees  nearly   jobs in iowa depend on the wind industry  these jobs aren't fads  they're our future  it's time to stop giving a   billion taxpayer subsidy to oil companies that are making money every time you go to the pump  and let's give some tax breaks to wind energy and homegrown energy and biofuels that are creating jobs right here in iowa  that's the choice in this election  that's what we're fighting for  we've got a different view when it comes to higher education  we're at a great small college here in iowa  and i applause i well  a young person asked my opponent  hoping to go to college  how he could help  he said  you know what  borrow money from your parents   i laughter i  that's not an answer  that's not a i guess it is an answer  it's not a good answer i laughter i to young people who are hoping to go to college or start a business  my view is  america has to lead once again when it comes to educating our kids and training our workers for the jobs of tomorrow  so let's help more young people afford the kind of education they can get here at morningside  let's help more young people and some not so young people go to community colleges and get trained in the skills that employers are looking for right now  we created a tax credit for middle class families trying to send their kids to college up to   over   years in college tuition because i believe that in america  higher education's no longer a luxury  it's a necessity that every family should be able to afford  that's the path we should be following  and you know what  it is up to you whether we go back to a health care system that lets insurance companies decide who to cover  when to cover it  whether they can drop you of your coverage whenever you need it most  or whether we keep moving forward with a law that is already cutting costs and covering more people and saving lives  they call it obamacare  i like that name  because i do care  i care about all the people that are being helped  all the folks who are going to be helped  and maybe they want to run on their  don't care  plan  but because of this law  nearly   million young people are able to stay on their parents' plans  your grandparents are saving money on their medicine  women have gained access to preventive care like mammograms and contraception  we don't need to refight the battles of the last   years  we need to go forward  we need to go forward  now  this november  you get to decide the future of this war in afghanistan  governor romney had nothing to say about afghanistan last week  didn't mention it  didn't offer a plan in terms of how he might end the war or if he's not going to end it  he's got to let the american people know  because by the end of this month  we will have brought   of our troops home  when i ended the war in iraq  he said it was  tragic  but you know what  i promised i was going to end that war  and we did  i said we'd take out al qaida and go after bin laden  and we did  i put forward a specific plan to bring our troops home from afghanistan by the end of   we are in the process of doing that right now  and when i say i'm going to bring them home  you know they're going to come home  and as long as i am commander in chief  when they get home  they know that we will serve our veterans as well as they've served us  because nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads or decent health care when they come home  that's a promise we will keep  on issue after issue  governor romney and congressman ryan  they're going to take us backwards  the story of america is going forward  that's what we do  we go forward  you will have the opportunity in   months to choose a path that will lead us to a better future  but i have to tell you  over the next   months the other side will spend more money than we have ever seen in our lifetimes  and it's basically the same thing they said a few nights ago  economy's doing bad  it's obama's fault  they won't tell you their plan because they know their plan won't work  go figure that raising taxes on middle class families to pay for a tax cut for me and mr  romney is not going to fly too well  so the what they're counting on is  if they can just feed enough negative information out there  you will get so discouraged that at some point you'll decide your vote doesn't matter  that you can't compete with the   million checks from wealthy donors  but you know what  i'm counting on something different  i'm counting on you  i need your help  i need your help  sioux city  i need your help  iowa  now  first of all  if you're not already registered  i need you to register to vote  young people who are in the audience you know who you are you need to go to gottaregister com  now  that is not  got to  it's  gotta i laughter i g o t t a register com  make sure you're registered to vote  then you can go to gottavote com that's not  got to  vote   gotta  vote to find out how to cast your ballot early  because here in iowa  you don't have to wait until november   to vote  you can be among the first to vote in this election  starting on september   so that's  gotta register  and that's  gotta vote  and the reason you got to register and you got to vote is because we got more work to do  we've got more good jobs to create  we've got more homegrown energy to generate  we've got more young people to send to great colleges like this one  we've got more great teachers we've got to hire  we've got more good schools that we've got to build  we've got more troops we've got to bring home  we've got more veterans we got to take care of  we've got more doors of opportunity that we have to open to every single american that's willing to work through them  and we have come too far to turn back now  that's why i'm asking for your vote  that's why i'm working for a second term  and if you are willing to stand with me and work with me and make phone calls with me and knock on some doors with me  if you're willing to vote for me this november  we're going to win woodbury county  we will win the state of iowa  we will win this election  we will finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  colorado  oh  go buffs  can everybody please give ryan a huge round of applause for that beautiful introduction  americans like ryan are why i ran for this office in the first place and why i am running for it again  it's great to see your outstanding governor  john hickenlooper  one of the finest senators that we've got in the country  michael bennet  outstanding congressman  jared polis  and it is good to be back in boulder  colorado  now  the last time i was here  i stopped by the sink for some pizza  i signed my name on the ceiling  i hope it's still there  i hope nobody vandalized it   i laughter i  and a girl i met there was so surprised that she spilled her frozen yogurt on my pants   i laughter i  but it was worth it because i've been told that the sink renamed one of their pizzas after me  i'm deeply moved by this   i laughter i  so the next time you go there  just ask for  the potus  it's got pepperoni  sausage  green pepper  black olives  and onion  we put the olives and the onion on there for michelle so you can say that you had some vegetables on your pizza   i laughter i  now  i've got to address a sensitive subject  i know you guys are a little bummed out about the game yesterday  i know the  rocky mountain showdown  did not go down the way you wanted  so i'll tell you what  we are going to give you a chance to get even  we are giving the buffs and the rams a second chance to go at it this fall  we've set up a  rocky mountain rumble  to see which school can register more voters  cu or colorado state  now  i was at colorado state last week  and because we had volunteers in the crowd to help  they got a little bit of a head start  so they are up by just   votes  but today we are in boulder  so let's get it done  there are volunteers throughout the audience  they can help you register today  when you go home  you can register your classmates  your friends  you go online to something called gottaregister com  i apologize in advance to english teachers  but this is not  got to register  this is  gotta  g o t t a register com  and this is important because just over   months from now  for the first time in many of your lives  you will get a chance to pick a president  and by doing so  you will get to a chance to choose the path that we take from here  now  last week  the other party gave their pitch at their convention down in florida   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote   i laughter i  i will say  though  that it was something to behold   i laughter i  despite all the challenges that we face in this new century  what they offered over those   days was an agenda that was better suited for the last century  it was a rerun  it could have been on  nick at nite   i laughter i  we've seen it before  you might as well have watched it on a black and white tv with some rabbit ears   i laughter i  and if you didn't dvr it  the basic recap goes something like this  the economy is not doing what it should be  it's all obama's fault that was a key theme i laughter i and governor romney knows the secret to creating jobs and growing the economy  and then  there was a lot of talk about  hard truths  and  bold choices  but the interesting thing was  nobody ever bothered to tell us what they were  and when governor romney finally had a chance to reveal the secret sauce  he did not offer a single new idea  it was just retreads of the same old policies we've been hearing for decades  the same policies that have been sticking it to the middle class for years  they talked a lot about me  and they talked a lot about governor romney  but they didn't spend a lot of time talking about you  they didn't talk about families like ryan's and what it might mean to go back to a time when folks with preexisting conditions couldn't get health care  you didn't hear them spend a lot of time talking about young people and the debt that they're incurring when they go to college  they spent even less time talking about what plans they had to actually meet these challenges and solve these problems  and you know why they didn't talk about it  it's not just because they know you won't like it and you won't like it i laughter i because you've already seen what happens when we try what they're offering  and you've lived through it  and you know we can't afford to repeat it  but it's also that they are exhausted of ideas  see  it turns out we know that making the middle class pay for another budget busting   tax cut for folks making   million a year or more won't magically translate into jobs and prosperity for everybody else  we know families aren't going to be better off if we undo wall street reform that we fought so hard to pass  and that can prevent another financial crisis  we know we're not going to be better off if we strip away regulations that protect our air and our water  we know we're not going to be better off if we strip away protections to make sure you've got health care when you get sick  seniors are pretty certain that the best way to strengthen medicare isn't to give them vouchers that leaves them to pay off any additional costs out of their own pockets  the point is everything you heard from them what little you did hear we've heard before  they have tried to sell us this tired  trickle down  you're on your own snake oil before  those ideas don't work  they didn't work then  they won't work now  they did not create jobs  they did not cut the deficit  they did not strengthen the middle class  they are not a plan to move this country forward  and we believe in something better  we believe in an america that says our economic strength has never come from the top down  it comes from the middle out  it comes from the bottom up  it comes from students and workers and small business owners  and a growing  thriving middle class  it comes from teachers and receptionists and firefighters and construction workers who are helping to build this country each and every day  that's the backbone of this country  we believe in an america that doesn't let how much money you've got determine whether or not you've got good health care  whether or not you can get a good college education  we believe in an america that doesn't just lead by the force of our amazing military and we are so grateful for their service but we also know that we've got to combine that with the strength of our ideals and the power of our example  we believe in an america where no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter who you love  you can pursue your own version of happiness  and you can make it here if you try  and that's what we've been working for   years now  colorado  that's what this campaign is about  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  now  on thursday night  i'm going to offer you what i believe is a better path forward  a path that will grow this economy and create more jobs and strengthen the middle class  and the good news is you get to choose the path we take  now  you can go with their plan to give massive new tax cuts to folks who have already made it  or we can go forward with my plan to keep taxes low for every american who is still trying to make it  when if you talk to a republican out there who says  oh  obama and democrats  they're all about tax and spend and all this  remind them i promised   years ago to cut taxes for middle class families  and the typical middle class family is paying a total of about   less in taxes now than when i came into office  i kept my promise  i kept that promise  and now i'm running to make sure taxes aren't raised a single dime for the first   of income  which means   percent of americans and   percent of small businesses will see their taxes remain low  because they're the ones who need relief  not folks like me  not folks like mr  romney  he needs it even less than i do   i laughter i  but this is ultimately going to be your choice  you can choose whether we cede new jobs and new industries to countries like china or whether we fight for those jobs in states like colorado  my opponent likes to tout his private sector experience  and he was incredibly successful and clearly disciplined and hard working  but keep in mind that his experience was investing in companies that were called  pioneers  in the business of outsourcing jobs  when the auto industry was on the verge of collapse  he said  let's  let detroit go bankrupt  and i've got a different vision for america  i bet on american workers  and i bet on american manufacturing  and today  the u s  auto industry has come roaring back  and by the way  the cars they're making are better and more fuel efficient than ever  that's how we move forward   i applause i  that's how we move forward  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  i want to give tax breaks to companies that are starting businesses right here in boulder  creating jobs right here in colorado  making sure that here in the united states of america we're making stuff again stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's the path forward that i'm offering in this election  you can decide whether governor romney's advice just borrow more money from your parents is an acceptable answer to young people who are trying to go to college  or you can take the path that we've already started on  making sure america once again leads the world in educating our kids and training our workers for the jobs of tomorrow  i want to make sure that we are helping more young people afford the kind of education that you can get right here at cu boulder  let's make more people be able to go to community colleges to be trained for the jobs that employers are hiring for right now  governor romney wants to end the tax credit that we created to help families save up to   over   years on their college tuition  i want to extend it  i don't want to end it  because in america today  a higher education cannot be a luxury  it is an economic necessity that every family should be able to afford  and you know that in your own lives  that's why you're here  that's why you're making an investment in yourself  and i want to make sure that america is standing by you every step of the way  because if you succeed  then we succeed  if we're producing more engineers  then america is producing more jobs  if we've got great teachers  then we're going to see the next generation be able to compete all over the world  that's what's at stake in this election  now  colorado  you look out at this amazing vista  and you say to yourself  part of what's at stake is energy and how we deal with this planet  you can choose an energy plan written by and for the oil companies  or you can choose what i've offered  an all of the above strategy for american energy  governor romney called renewable energy  imaginary  he said the jobs that actually  it was congressman ryan who said that the jobs they create are  fads  let me tell you  there are   good colorado jobs right now that depend on wind and solar power  these jobs are worth fighting for  and so i think it's time to stop giving   billion a year in taxpayer subsidies to big oil companies that are making money every time you fill up a tank of gas  let's keep investing in homegrown energy sources that have never been more promising  that are good for our economy  that are good for our national security  that will create jobs and are good for our planet as well  that's the path we're offering  that's the choice we're going to have in this election   i audience member i  i love you  obama   i the president i  i love you back  but we got to vote  it's up to you whether we go back to a health care system that let insurance companies decide who to cover and when  or we can keep moving forward with the new health care law that's already cut costs and covered more people and saved more lives  governor romney promised that on his first day of office  he's going to sit right down and grab a pen and end obamacare   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  what that means is right away  he'd kick nearly   million young people off their parent's plan  he'd take hope away from tens of millions of americans with preexisting conditions by repealing reform  he calls it obamacare  and i like the name  i do care  we fought to pass that law for families like ryan's  we know the heartbreak of a broken health care system  so i don't mind if folks think i care  i do care  and i don't know exactly what the other side is proposing  i guess you could call it  romney doesn't care   i laughter i  but this law is here to stay  we're not going to refight the battles of the last   years  we're going to implement this law  make the health care system work for families all across america  it is time to move forward  that's the choice in this election  of course  this isn't the only battle that they want to refight  they want to refight some battles we thought were settled in the last century  so  in november  you will have some say as to whether women should be trusted to make their own health care decisions  i think they are  you will have some say as to whether students who were brought here by their parents as infants and have gone to school here and understand themselves to be americans and have pledged allegiance  that suddenly  they should be kicked out of the only country they've ever known   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i don't think so  i've got a different view  you will have some say as to whether we should rewrite the constitution the way the other side's proposing  to prevent gay americans from being able to marry the person they love   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  you can reaffirm that the strength of our character doesn't come from shoving people to the sidelines  it comes from hearing every voice  harnessing every talent realizing that in america  we are greater together than we are on our own  that's who we are   i applause i  that's who we are  and that's what's at stake in this election  this november  you get to decide the future of the afghanistan war  governor romney had nothing to say about afghanistan last week  yes  he hasn't offered a plan for the   troops who will have come home from this war by the end of this month  he said that ending the war in iraq was  tragic  i think it was the right thing to do  and i said i would do it  and we did  i said we'd take out bin laden  and we did  we are bringing our troops home from afghanistan  and i've set a timetable  we will have them all out of there by   governor romney doesn't have a timetable  i think he's wrong  that's what's at stake in this election  and as long as i'm commander in chief  we will serve our veterans as well as they've served us  because nobody who fights for us should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  that's the choice in this election  so  boulder  on issue after issue  governor romney and congressman ryan want to go backwards  but the story of america is about going forwards  nobody understands that better than folks in the west  because this is a region that was settled by people who understand we're not looking back  we're going forward  we're going forward to the next frontier  to new horizons  and in   months  you get to choose the path that will lead us to that better future  but understand  over the next   months  the other side is going to spend more money than we've ever seen in our lives  with an avalanche of attack ads and insults and making stuff up i laughter i just making stuff up  and they'll be supported by   million checks that are being written by wealthy donors who are trying to protect things just as they are  and what they're counting on is that you get so discouraged by this  that at a certain point  you just say  you know what  i'm going to leave it up to somebody else  i'm going to let big oil write the energy bills  and i'm going to let insurance companies decide when to cover somebody  and we're going to let politicians dictate what a woman can and can't do when it comes to her own health   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  they're counting on you to accept their version of the things the way they ought to be  and i'm counting on something different  i'm counting on you  you've always had powerful forces in this country who benefit from the status quo  and they bet against the american people  and i've always bet on you  i don't believe you're cynical  i don't believe in your complacency  those other guys  they always lose the bet over the long term  and they're going to lose the bet this time as well  but that's going to depend on you  it's going to depend on you registering to vote  it's going to depend on you showing up to vote  i was over at the buff before i came here  and the food looked really good   i laughter i  people were having mimosas and bloody marys   i laughter i  and i was thinking to myself  i could see folks  like  forgetting to vote   i laughter i  they're having too much fun  but that's why you're so important  because you're going to have to set an example for the person next to you in class  you're going to have to remind them  have you voted yet  you're going to have to call up your family or your cousins in the other states  you're going to have to reach up and close that gap between what america is and what it should be  because you know what  you can't wait on somebody else  it turns out other folks are waiting on you  they're waiting to see if you'll register  they're waiting to see if you'll vote  they're waiting to see if you'll lead  colorado  we have come too far to turn back now  we've got more good jobs to create  we've got more homegrown energy to generate  we've got more young people to send to college  we've got more good teachers to hire  we've got more good schools to build  we've got one more war to end  we've got more troops we've got to bring home  we've got more veterans we've got to take care of  we've got more doors of opportunity that we have to open for every single person who's willing to work hard and walk through them  that's why i'm asking you for a second term  and if you're willing to work with me and knock on some doors with me  make some phone calls with me  if you're willing to vote for me in november  we will win boulder and we will win colorado  we will win this election  we will finish what we started  and we will remind the world why it is that the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  toledo  thank you  thank you  it is good to be in toledo  ohio   i audience members i  obama  obama  obama  thank you   i the president i  thank you  thank you so much  now  first of all  i've got to say thank you for kenyatta  for that outstanding introduction  give kenyatta a big round of applause  i was listening backstage  and i thought i heard a little preaching going on there   i laughter i  folks in the crowd were going  yeah   wow   i laughter i  so kenyatta can talk  no doubt about it  it is great to see so many good friends   i audience members i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  it's great to see so many good friends who work so hard on behalf of working families every day  we've got sherrod brown  one of the best senators in the country  marcy kaptur  one of the best congresswomen in the country  we've got my friend and your friend  daughter of a teamster  our secretary of labor  hilda solis in the house  we've got your outstanding uaw president bob king in the house  president of the afl cio  rich trumka is here  and the president of the national education association  dennis van roekel  so we've got some working people in the house here  and to everybody who is working hard each and every day  happy labor day  happy labor day   i audience member i  we got your back  obama   i the president i  thank you  now  for those of you who have got a seat  feel free to take a seat  i've got some things to say  i've got some things to say here  for those of you who don't have a seat  make sure to bend your knees a little bit  we don't want you fainting  sometimes  folks are standing too long  they drop off   i laughter i  now  we're on our way to our convention in charlotte this week  but i wanted to stop here in toledo to spend this day with you a day that belongs to the working men and women of america teachers and factory workers  construction workers and students  and families and small business owners  and i know we've got some proud autoworkers in the house helping to bring toledo back  after all  it's working folks like you who fought for jobs and opportunity for generations of american workers  it's working people like you who helped to lay the cornerstones of middle class security  things that people now sometimes take for granted  but weren't always there  the   hour work week  weekends  paid leave  pensions  the minimum wage  health care  social security  medicare  those things happened because working people organized and mobilized  it is unions like yours that helped to forge the basic bargain of this country  the bargain that built the greatest middle class and the most prosperous country and the most prosperous economy that the world has ever known  and you know what that bargain is  because it's a simple one  it's a bargain that says if you work hard  if you're responsible  then your work should be rewarded  that if you put in enough effort  you should be able to find a job that pays the bills  you should afford a home to call your own  that you'll have health care you can count on if you get sick  that you can put away enough to retire  maybe take a vacation once in a while nothing fancy  but you can enjoy your friends and your family  and most importantly  then you can provide your children with an education to make sure that they do even better than you did  it's an american promise that says no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your last name is  no matter who you love  you can make it here if you try  and that's what we're fighting for  toledo  that's what's at stake in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  now  last week  the other party gave their sales pitch at their convention down in florida   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote   i laughter i  vote  and i have to say  it was something to see  despite all the challenges that we face in this new century  we saw   straight days of an agenda out of the last century  it was a rerun  you might as well have watched it on black and white tv with some rabbit ears on there   i laughter i  it should have been on  nick at nite   i laughter i  now  if you didn't dvr it  let me give you a basic recap of what they said  the economy is bad  it's all obama's fault  and governor romney has the secret to creating jobs and growing the economy  that's a basic summary  they spent the most time on me   i laughter i  they were talking about me   i laughter i  and there was a lot of  hard truths  and  bold choices  they said  but nobody ever bothered to tell you what they really were  and when governor romney had his chance to let you in on the secret sauce of job creation i laughter i he did not offer you a single new idea  it was just a retread of the same old policies that have been sticking it to the middle class for years  and then  after the convention  governor romney came here to ohio  and he said he's going to be the coach that leads america to a  winning season  the problem is everybody has already seen his economic playbook  we know what's in it  on first down  he hikes taxes by nearly   on the average family with kids in order to pay for a massive tax cut for multimillionaires  that's on first down  it sounds like unnecessary roughness to me   i laughter i  on second down  he calls an audible and undoes reforms that are there to prevent another financial crisis and bank bailout  he wants to get rid of rules that are there to protect our air and our water and workers' rights and protections to make sure health care is there for you when you get sick  and then  on third down  he calls for a hail mary  ending medicare as we know it by giving seniors a voucher that leaves them to pay any additional cost out of their pocket  there's a flag on the play  loss of up to an additional   a year for the same benefits you get now  that's their playbook  that's their economic plan  and i've got one piece of advice for you about the romney ryan game plan  ohio  punt it away  it won't work  it won't win the game  you don't need that coach  that's a losing season  now  there was one person at governor romney's convention last week who wasn't entirely on script   i laughter i   i audience member i  boo   i the president i  no  no because while they were busy telling folks how bad everything is  your governor  john kasich   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i laughter i   i the president i  john kasich stood up there and told everybody that ohio is now number one in the midwest in job creation  fourth best in america  which got folks kind of confused  because if it's all obama's fault and nothing is going right  what's going on in ohio  now  i guess the theory was that it's all the governor's doing  but i think we need to refresh his memory  because a lot of those jobs are autoworker jobs like yours  the american auto industry supports one in eight jobs in this state  and just a few years ago  when the auto industry was flatlining  what was in his and governor romney's playbook   let detroit go bankrupt  you remember that   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  now  think about what that would have meant not just for ohio  but for america  if we had turned our backs on you  if america had thrown in the towel like that  gm and chrysler wouldn't exist today  the suppliers and the distributors that get their business from these companies would have died off  too  then even ford could have gone down as well  production shut down  factories shuttered  once proud companies chopped up and sold off in scraps  and all of you the men and women who built these companies with your own hands you would have been benched for good  that's not a good play  we didn't run that play  more than   million americans across the country would have lost their jobs in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the great depression  in communities across the midwest  it would have been another great depression  and it's not just the workers themselves  think about everybody who depends on you  schoolteachers  small business owners  the server in the diner who knows your order before you walk in  the bartender who knows your order before you walk in  their livelihoods were at stake as well  and so was something else  how many autoworkers here worked the assembly line  but your dads and your granddads  maybe your mom  grandmas worked on that same line  how many people are second or third or fourth generation  how many of you have sons and daughters who hope to work on those same assembly lines  these jobs are worth more than just a paycheck  they're a source of pride  they're a ticket into a middle class life  these companies are worth more than just the cars that they build  they're a symbol of america's innovation  they're a source of our manufacturing might  if that is not worth fighting for  then what is  ohio  we're not about to take a knee and do nothing  we weren't going to give up on your jobs and your families and your communities  we weren't going to let detroit go bankrupt or lordstown go bankrupt or toledo go bankrupt  i stood with american workers  i stood with american manufacturing  i believed in you  i bet on you  i'll make that bet any day of the week  and because of that bet    years later  that bet is paying off for america  three years later  the american auto industry has come roaring back  nearly   new jobs  so it's a little funny watching governor romney and governor kasich and others just try to rewrite history now that you're back on your feet  these are the folks who said  if we went forward with our plan  then i'm quoting here you can kiss the american automotive industry goodbye  now they're saying it was their idea all along   i laughter i  seriously  or what they're saying is  well  the problem is that you  the workers  made out like bandits in this whole thing  that we did what we did because it was all about paying back unions  really  i mean  even by the standards of political campaigns  that's a lot of you know what  workers made some of the biggest sacrifices  about   retirees saw a reduction in the health benefits they had earned  hours were reduced  pay and wages scaled back  you gave up promises made to you over the years for the sake and the survival of your fellow workers and their families and the company  you made sacrifices  which is why i don't understand why these folks have the nerve to talk about you like you're some greedy special interest that needs to be beaten down  after all that unions have done to build and protect the middle class  they were standing up there at their convention saying you're responsible for the problems we face  their plan says the best way to help workers is to roll back workers' rights  to overturn laws that make sure construction workers get a fair wage  to blame teachers and firefighters and police officers and other public servants for our economic challenges instead of what happened on wall street and a historic financial collapse  so  toledo  what you need to know is this  when they're trying to take your collective bargaining rights away  when they're trying to pass so called  right to work  laws that really mean right to work for less and less  you should know this isn't about economics  this is about politics  this notion that we should have let the auto industry die and that we should pursue antiworker policies in the hopes that unions like yours will unravel  it's part of the same old you're on your own  top down philosophy that says we should just leave everybody to fend for themselves  now  on thursday night  i'm going to offer you what i believe is a better path forward  a path that's going to grow this economy and create more good jobs and strengthen the middle class  and the good news is  starting on october   ohio gets its say because you get to vote early  you can choose which path we take  you could choose their plan   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  you can choose to give massive new tax cuts to folks who have already made it  or you can choose my plan  to keep taxes low for every american who is in the middle class and every american who is striving to get into that middle class  four years ago  i promised to cut taxes by a total for middle class families  and i have cut taxes by a total of about   for the typical family  and now i'm running to make sure that taxes aren't raised a single dime on the first   of any family's income  now  that's   percent of americans  it may be   percent of this auditorium  your taxes won't go up  because my belief is you need relief  i don't need relief  mitt romney doesn't need relief  he needs it less than me   i laughter i  but that's a choice in this election  you can choose whether we give up new jobs and new industries to countries like china  or whether we fight to keep those jobs in states like ohio  unlike my opponent  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to give those tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in toledo  right here in the united states  all across ohio  all across the midwest  you can decide whether borrowing money from your parents is an answer when a young person asks how they're going to go to college  you heard about that  right  this young college student says  how can i get some help going to college  he says  well  you need to borrow money from your parents   i laughter i  now  i guess that's one path  that's one approach  i've got a different approach that says let's make sure americans once again lead the world in educating our kids and training our workers for the jobs of tomorrow  and that means let's hire more great teachers  especially in math and science  let's help more folks go to community colleges to get trained in the skills that employers are hiring for right now  because the truth is  some sort of higher education  whether it's  year or a  year technical school some form of higher education that's not a luxury anymore  that is an economic necessity that every family should be able to afford  and that's what i'm going to be fighting for  that's what i'm going to be fighting for  now  ohio  you can choose an energy plan like the other guy is offering that's written by and for the oil companies  or you can choose an all of the above strategy for american energy  which means we drill for more oil  we mine for more coal  but it also means that we're going after the new energy sources of the future  now  my opponent said renewable energy sources are imaginary  the folks here in toledo manufacturing solar panels might disagree with that  these jobs aren't a fad  they're not imaginary  they're our future  and unlike my opponent  i want to stop giving a   billion a year taxpayer subsidy to big oil companies that are making money every time you go to the pump and i want to use that money to invest in homegrown energy sources that have never been more promising and are creating jobs right here in ohio  it's up to you whether we go back to the old health care system that let insurance companies decide when to cover you and when to cover you and drop you when you needed it most  but i think we should keep moving forward with the new health care law that's already cutting costs and covering more people and saving lives  they call it obamacare  it's true  i care  it's true  i guess the other side's plan is the  romney doesn't care  plan   i laughter i  but now is not the time to refight the battles of the last   years  we need to move forward  you get to decide what the future of the war in afghanistan is  last week  did you notice governor romney did not say a word about our troops who are in harm's way over there  and because of my plan    of them will have come home by the end of this month  he said ending the war in iraq was tragic  i think it was the right thing to do  i said we'd end that war  and we did  i said we'd go after al qaida  we did  i said we'd take out bin laden  we did  our troops are out of iraq  we're bringing them home from afghanistan  and as long as i'm commander in chief  we will serve our veterans as well as they've served us  because nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  that's why i'm running for a second term  so we've got some big choices we've got to make  and the other side is going to spend the next   months  they're fighting back with everything they've got  they're going to give you an avalanche of attack ads and insults and distraction  and they may massage the truth a little bit  and it will be supported with   million checks from wealthy donors  and they know that even if you don't buy into their plan  even if you don't vote for them  they're thinking  well  maybe we'll discourage people  we'll get folks so disillusioned by all these negative ads  all this negativity  that you'll just decide to sit this one out   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  but you know what  i'm counting on something different  i'm counting on you  i'm counting on you  if you're not registered to vote  then you've got to go to gottaregister com  now  that's not  got to register com  this is  gotta g o t t a register com  if you want to find out how to vote early  starting on october   then you need to go to gottavote com  that's not  got to vote com  that's  gotta vote i laughter i gotta register   gotta vote because we've got a whole lot of more work to do  we've got more good jobs to create  we've got more good cars to build  we've got more schools to upgrade and more great teachers to hire and more young people to send to college  and we've got more troops we've got to bring home and more veterans we've got to take care of and more doors of opportunity that we've got to open up for everybody who is willing to walk through them  that's what's at stake in this election  that's why i'm asking for your vote  that's why i need you to knock on doors  that's why i need you to get on the phone  i need you to talk to your friends  i need you to talk to your neighbors  i need you to stand with me  ohio  and if we win toledo  we will win ohio  and if we win ohio  we'll win this election  and if we win this election  we will finish what we started  and we will remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  thank you  god bless you  and god bless america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  norfolk state  go spartans  can everybody please give ed a huge round of applause not just for that introduction  but for his extraordinary service to our country and to our veterans  it's good to see all of you  we've got bobby scott  your great congressman in the house  we've got your next congressman  paul hirschbiel is here  we are very proud to have an olympic gold medalist  francena mccorory   x  relay winner  i'm not that fast   i laughter i  i was watching those folks on tv  i said  those are some fast people  it is good to be back in norfolk  this is our last stop on the way to the convention in charlotte  i decided to come back here today despite the fact that  back in march  norfolk state ruined my ncaa bracket  i had missouri going pretty deep  but i want you to know i've got no hard feelings   i laughter i  let's just say you owe me one   i laughter i  now  i know that whatever i say here today  it's going to be  at best  a distant second to the speech you will hear tonight from the star of the obama family  michelle obama  this is just like a relay  and you start off with the fastest person   i laughter i  so i'm going to be at home and i'm going to be watching it with our girls  and i'm going to try not to let them see their daddy cry  because when michelle starts talking  i start getting all misty   i the president i  but i'm looking forward to being in charlotte myself  i'll go down there tomorrow  and last week  our friends in the other party had their convention   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  vote   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  just in case some of you missed it  some of you didn't dvr the republican convention  let me give you a basic recap  basically  they said  first of all  everything is bad and it's obama's fault and governor romney knows the secret to creating jobs and growing the economy  the only problem was  he kept it secret   i laughter i  there was a lot of talk about  hard truths  and  bold choices  but they never bothered to tell you what they were  and when my opponent had the chance to offer his secret sauce  he did not offer a single new idea  it was just retreads of the same old policies that have been sticking it to the middle class for years  they spent a lot of time talking about me  but they didn't spend a lot of time talking about you  they didn't talk a lot about how we're going to move forward so that the middle class is strong  so that the economy is growing for everybody  they spent even less time talking about their plans  and that's not just because they know you won't like it  but it's because they know you saw what happened when we tried it  you've lived through it  and you know we can't afford to repeat it  i mean  think about it  a plan that says we're going to make middle class families pay for another budget busting   tax cut for people making   million a year or more  that's not really persuasive to most people  we don't think that will magically translate into jobs or prosperity for people  we know families won't be better off if we undo all the wall street reforms we've put into place to prevent another financial crisis or that we're going to be better off if we remove rules to protect our air and our water or if we're going to take away protections we put in place to make sure that health care is there for you when you get sick  and we are certainly positive that the best way to strengthen medicare isn't to turn it into a voucher that leaves seniors paying additional costs out of pocket   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  that's not a plan to create jobs  it's not a plan to lower the deficit  it's not a plan to strengthen the middle class  it's not a plan to strengthen this country   i audience members i  no   i the president i  we believe in something better  we believe in an america that says our economic strength doesn't come from the top down  it comes from the middle out  it comes from the bottom up  it comes from workers and students and small business owners and a strong  thriving middle class  we believe in an america where going to school doesn't depend on how much money you have  we believe in an america where getting decent health care doesn't depend on how much money you've got  we believe in an america that leads with our military  but also takes care of our veterans and stands up for our ideals and shows the power of our example  we believe in an america where no matter who you are  where you come from  what you look like  what your last name is  you can pursue your own happiness  and you can make it if you try  that's what these last   years have been about  that's what this campaign is about  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president   i now  the other side may not have been eager to talk about their ideas  but on thursday night  i'm going to look forward to sharing mine with you  on thursday night  i will offer what i believe is a better path forward  a path that will create good jobs and strengthen our middle class and grow our economy  and the good news is  virginia  that in just   months  you get to choose which path we take  you can choose their path  give massive new tax cuts to folks who have already made it  or you can choose my plan  i want to keep taxes low for every american who's out there still trying to make it  i've cut taxes by a total of about   for the typical family  i kept my promise to cut taxes for middle class families and for small businesses  and now i'm running to make sure that taxes aren't raised by a single dime on your family's first   of income  which  by the way  means   percent of americans wouldn't pay a single dime more in income tax  but that will be up to you  it will be up to your vote  i mean  you can decide whether we give new jobs and new industries to countries like china or whether we fight for those jobs in places like virginia  unlike my opponent  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give those tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in american plants and american factories and american jobs so we can go out there and make products stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's why i'm running for a second term  when a young person asked governor romney what he could do to help folks go to college  he suggested   borrow money from your parents   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  but maybe he wasn't aware that there are actually some young people whose parents would love to give them the money and don't have it  so that's one path  my path is to make sure america once again leads the world in educating our kids and training our workers  let's help more young people afford the kind of education you students get here at norfolk state  let's keep investing more in our hbcus  let's continue to make sure that pell grants are there for folks who need it  let's help more folks go to community college to get the skills and the training that companies are hiring for right now  governor romney wants to end the tax credit we created that is saving families up to   over   years in tuition costs  i want to expand it  because higher education  that's not a luxury anymore  it is an economic necessity in the  st century for every family  and every family should be able to afford it  that's what we're fighting for  that's why i'm running for a second term  but it's going to be up to you  you'll make the choice  virginia  you can choose an energy plan written by and for the big oil companies  that's governor romney's plan  or you can choose a strategy that taps into all of america's resources and ingenuity  renewable energy isn't  imaginary  those jobs that we're creating in wind power and solar power  those aren't a  fad  and i think it's time to stop giving   billion a year in taxpayer subsidies that are going to big oil companies that are making money every time you go to the pump  and let's invest in homegrown energy sources that will create good jobs here in the united states of america  that's the choice in this election  and it's up to you whether we go back to a health care system that says insurance companies can deny you coverage whenever they want  i think we need to keep moving forward with the new health care law  it's cutting costs  it's covering more people  it's saving lives  they like to call it obamacare  well  let me tell you  i do care  i care about all the young people who are able to stay on their parents' plans now  i care about the seniors who are seeing lower prescription drug costs  i care about folks with preexisting conditions who can't be denied care now  governor romney has promised that he would overturn obamacare on his first day in office  which means he'd kick nearly   million young people off their parents' plans  he'd make seniors' prescription drugs more expensive  maybe we should call his plan  romney doesn't care   i laughter i  but i do care  and this law is here to stay  and we're not going to refight the battles we've already fought over the last   years  we're not going backwards  we're moving forward  that's why i'm running for reelection  this november  you get to decide the future of the war in afghanistan  by the end of this month  i will have brought home   troops  i've said we will end this war in   governor romney last week didn't have a word to say about afghanistan  he said the way i ended the war in iraq was  tragic  listen  i promised i'd end the war in iraq  and i did  i said we'd take out bin laden  we did  getting our troops out of iraq was the right thing to do  bringing our troops home from afghanistan in a responsible way is the right thing to do  and as long as i'm commander in chief  we will serve our veterans as well as they've served us  because nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  that's a solemn obligation  that's why i fought to strengthen the post  gi bill  that's how why we secured the largest increase in va funding in decades  that's why i fought to create a new tax cut for business owners who hire veterans  that's why michelle and jill biden challenged ceos to hire   of our veterans by the end of the next year  last month  michelle and jill stood with those ceos and announced they've already hit   veterans being hired  they are beating their schedule by a year  that's the commitment we've shown  so  virginia  norfolk  on issue after issue  governor romney and congressman ryan  they want to take us backwards  but the story of america is not about going backwards  it's about going forward  and in   months  you will actually choose whether or not we travel that path  but i want everybody to understand  over these next   months  over these next   days  you will see more ads  more negative ads  more insults and distractions and baloney  than you've ever seen  and it will be supported by   million checks from wealthy donors that like things just the way they are  and they're counting on you  maybe not to vote for romney  but they're counting on you to feel discouraged  and they figure if you don't vote  then big oil will write our energy future and insurance companies will write our health care plans and politicians will dictate what a woman can or can't do when it comes to her own health  they're counting on you just to accept their version of things  but i'm counting on something different  those who oppose change  those who benefit from an unjust status quo  they're always betting on complacency and cynicism of the american people  but throughout america's history  they've always lost that bet  and i think they're going to lose that bet this time too  but  virginia  that depends on you  it depends on you registering to vote  it depends on you showing up to vote  it depends on you setting an example for the next person in class or at your workplace or in the next town or your cousin in the next state  you've got to call them  you've got to let them know what is at stake  that we can close the gap between what america should be and what it is right now  because they may be waiting on you  they're waiting to see if you register  they're waiting to see if you vote  we've come too far to turn back now  we've created a lot of jobs  but we've got more jobs to create  we've created a lot of homegrown energy  but we've got more energy to generate  we've got a lot more young people to send to college  we've got a lot more good teachers we've got to hire and more good schools we've got to build  we've got more troops we've got to bring home  and we've got more veterans we've got to take care of  we've got more doors of opportunity we've got to open up to everybody who is willing to work hard and walk through those doors  and that's why i'm running for a second term  and if you're willing to stand with me and you're willing to make some phone calls for me  if you're willing to knock on some doors for me  if you're willing to vote for me  we'll win norfolk again  we'll win virginia again  we'll win this election  we will finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  virginia  and god bless america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  new hampshire  oh  it is good to be back in portsmouth  it is great to be with your outstanding governor  john lynch  who  like me  had the good judgment to marry up   i laughter i  we love susan as well  one of the best senators in the country  jeanne shaheen  your mayor  eric spear  and your next congresswomen  carol shea porter and annie kuster  it is good to see all of you  and it's just great to be back in portsmouth  i was telling john that   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  i was telling john that i will always have great memories of portsmouth  because one of the things that happens as you're running for president is the bubble starts closing in on you  so i still remember some of the last places where i got to take a walk with nobody around   i laughter i  and portsmouth  in   was one of those places  it was a gorgeous day like today  and i actually we walked  and we came right down here  and there was a theater  an improv thing going on  and i sat there  and i think i might have bought some ice cream   i laughter i  which reminds me  by the way  malia and sasha love new hampshire not only because this is where they go to camp  but it's also where they first campaigned with us  and i think the first day of campaigning  they got ice cream four times in a row   i laughter i  so they turned to michelle and me  and they said  we love this campaigning thing   i laughter i  we want to campaign with you all the time   i laughter i  now  i've just come from charlotte  where we had a great convention  folks down there could not have been more welcoming  michelle was amazing  president clinton made the case in the way only he can  somebody e mailed me after his speech  they said  you need to appoint him secretary of explaining stuff   i laughter i  that was pretty good  i like that  secretary of explaining stuff 'splainin'   i laughter i  joe biden was fired up  and i meant what i said at the convention  i could not have a better vice president  but as importantly  i could not ask for a better and more loyal friend than joe biden  he is a wonderful  wonderful man  and last night  i did my best to lay out the stakes in this election  you see  now that both sides have made their argument  there's a big choice to make  and i honestly believe this is the biggest choice  the clearest choice  of any time in our generation  because it's not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties  it is a choice between two different paths for america  two fundamentally different visions for how we move forward  see  ours is a fight for that basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known  the promise that hard work will pay off  that responsibilities will be rewarded  that everyone gets a fair shot  everybody is doing their fair share  everybody is playing by the same rules  from wall street to main street to washington  dc  that basic bargain is why i ran for president  and that's why i'm running again  that's what this election is about   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  that is what this election is about  i mentioned last night i got my start in service because i worked with folks who had been laid off from the steel plants that had closed when jobs started getting shipped overseas  and over the last   years  we've seen that happen more and more and too many families struggling with costs that keep rising even when paychecks don't  so people are having to use their credit cards or home equity loans just to try to make the mortgage or pay tuition or put gas in the car or food on the table  and that debt is why this house of cards collapsed in the great recession  millions of innocent americans losing their jobs and their homes  folks losing their life savings  and we are fighting to recover from that and it's a long  tough journey  but our friends at the republican convention  they've talked a lot about what they thought was wrong with america  they didn't tell you what was right  they didn't tell you what they'd do to make it right  they want your vote  but they don't want to show you their plan  and that's because they know their plan won't sell  that's because all they've got to offer is the same prescriptions that they've had for the last   years  tax cuts  tax cuts  gut some regulations  oh  and more tax cuts   i laughter i  tax cuts when times are good  tax cuts when times are bad  tax cuts to help you lose a few extra pounds   i laughter i  tax cuts to improve your love life   i laughter i  it will cure anything  according to them  now  let me tell you something  listen  i've cut taxes for people who need it  middle class families  small business owners  in   i promised i would cut middle class taxes  the typical family's tax burden is federal level is   less since i took office  so i've kept that promise  i've kept that promise  we've cut taxes for small businesses   times  but i do not believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires is what's going to bring good jobs back to our shores or pay down our deficit  i don't believe firing teachers or kicking students off financial aid is going to grow our economy  not when china is producing more engineers and more scientists and we've got to compete with them  after we were on the brink of financial meltdown because of irresponsible decisions made on wall street  i don't believe that rolling back regulations there is somehow going to help small business women or businessmen expand or laid off construction workers get back to work  we have been there  we've tried what they're selling  it didn't work then  it's not going to work now  we're not going back  we are moving forward  that's why all of you are here today  and i'm not going to pretend that this path is quick or easy  and by the way  i never have  as bill clinton reminded us on wednesday night  it's going to take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that were building up over decades  we know that  today we learned that after losing around   jobs a month when i took office  business once again added jobs for the  th month in a row  a total of more than   million jobs  but that's not good enough  we know it's not good enough  we need to create more jobs faster  we need to fill the hole left by this recession faster  we need to come out of this crisis stronger than when we went in  and there's a lot more that we can do  when congress gets back to town next week  you need to send them a message  go ahead and give middle class families and small businesses the confidence of knowing that their taxes your taxes will not go up next year  everybody agrees we shouldn't raise taxes on the middle class  let's go ahead and get that done  let's get it done now  and by the way  if the republicans are serious about being concerned about joblessness  we could create a million new jobs right now if congress would pass the jobs plan that i sent to them a year ago  jobs for teachers  jobs for construction workers  jobs for folks who have been looking for work for a long time  we can do that  but i need your help  new hampshire  i need your voices  you see   i audience member i  you've got them   i audience member i  we're with you  man   i the president i  i appreciate that  then i need you to get your cousins i laughter i and your friends  your coworkers  look  i am not just asking for your vote  i'm asking the entire country to rally around a set of goals for our country  goals in manufacturing  energy  education  national security  and the deficit  and these this is a real  achievable plan that will lead to new jobs and more opportunity and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation  that's what we can do in the next   years  that's why i'm running for a second term as president  to finish the job  to keep moving forward  to build up the progress we've made  so let me be a little more specific  first  i've got a plan to export more products  not outsource jobs  after a decade of decline  this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last   years  we've reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world  and so now  americans  we have a choice  we can keep giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  or we can start rewarding companies that are investing right here in new hampshire  putting americans back to work  selling products around the world  we can help big factories and small businesses double their exports  we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  you can make that happen  but i'm going to need your help  second  i've got a plan to control more of our own energy  after   years of inaction  we finally raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that will save you money   i applause i  that will save you money  we've doubled our use of renewable energy  solar  wind  biofuels  and tens of thousands of americans have jobs today because they're building wind turbines and long lasting batteries  the other side likes to talk about energy  but they don't mention that the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades  the other side wants to reverse that progress  i want to build on it  i'm not going to let oil companies dictate the country's energy plan  and i don't want them to keep collecting   billion a year in corporate welfare from our taxpayers  we've got a better path  we want to keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal technology  we want to see farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and our trucks  i want construction workers who are sitting at home right now  i want them building homes and factories that waste less energy and retrofitting those that are already built to save energy  and we can develop a hundred years' supply of natural gas right beneath our feet  if we choose this path  we can cut oil imports in half by   we can support   new jobs in natural gas development alone  that's how we move forward  third   i audience member i  let's do it   i the president i  let's do it   i applause i  let's do it  we can do this  we can do this  look  third  third  third i've got even more i laughter i i've got a plan to give more americans the chance to gain the skills that they need to compete  education  i would not be standing here if i hadn't gotten a great education  michelle would not be where she is without the opportunities that were given  and as she told you on tuesday night  we didn't come from wealth or fame or power  but in this country  we've always made a commitment that if you've got talent and you're willing to work hard  somebody is going to give you the opportunity to get a great education  and then you can go as far as your dreams can take you  it is the gateway to a middle class life in the  st century  so what have we already done  nearly every state has answered our call to raise standards for teaching and learning  some of the worst schools in the country have already seen real gains in math and reading  millions of students are paying less for college today because we took on a system where   billion was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program  we said  let's cut out the middleman and give that money directly to students so that they get a better deal  so now you've got a choice  we can gut our commitment to education like the other side's budget would end up doing   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  or we can decide  here in america  no child should give up her dreams because a classroom is overcrowded or a school is crumbling  no family should set aside that college acceptance letter because they figure they just can't afford it  and no company should be looking for the workers they need overseas because they can't find them here at home  so  new hampshire  i need you to help me recruit   math and science teachers  and improve early childhood education and give   million workers the skills they need at community colleges and help colleges and universities cut tuition growth in half over the next   years  we can meet these goals together  that's the america that we want for our kids   i audience member   i forward   i the president   i forward  forward  i need   more years  and we're going to move forward  fourth  fourth  my plan would reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class  now  the debt and the deficit are real medium  and long term problems  and we're going to have to address it  and i want to get working  independent analysis shows that my plan would cut our deficit by   trillion that's with a  t  and i've worked with the republicans in congress already to cut   trillion in spending  and i'm prepared to do more  i want to reform our tax code so that it is simple and fair and so it asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over   so even well to do folks would still keep their tax break up to   but after that  we want to go back to the same rates we had when bill clinton was president  our economy created   million new jobs then  we had the biggest surplus in history  we created a whole lot of millionaires to boot  we didn't punish success  we created an environment for greater success all across the economy  that's what we're fighting for  my opponent says he wants to reduce the deficit too  but as was pointed out at the convention  there's a basic component missing from his plan  math   i laughter i  arithmetic  when governor romney and his allies tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks skewed towards the wealthy  the math doesn't work  you can't dig yourself a deeper hole  you can't take   trillion out of the treasury and then say you're going to close it  and when you ask them  well  how are you going to do it  well  they won't answer real clearly  but there are only a few ways of doing it  and most of them involve sticking it to the middle class  i refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children out of head start programs or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans who are poor or elderly or disabled  all so folks like me and mitt romney can pay less  i won't turn medicare into a voucher system  you shouldn't have to spend your golden years at the mercy of insurance companies after a lifetime of work  you should be able to retire with dignity and respect  you've earned it  and so yes  we need to reform and strengthen medicare for the long haul  but we've got to do it by reducing the actual cost of health care  not by dumping those costs on to seniors who end up paying thousands of dollars more  that's not how we're going to do it  and we will keep the promise of social security by taking responsible steps to strengthen it  but we're not going to privatize it  we're not turning it over to wall street  we're not going to do that  now  rebuilding the economy is essential  but our prosperity at home is linked to what we do abroad  four years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  and we did  i said we'd wind down the war in afghanistan  and we are  a new tower rises above the new york skyline  we have decimated al qaida's leadership  and usama bin laden is dead  so now we know moving forward  as commander in chief  i will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  we are going to make sure that we've got a strong navy  and what goes on here in the yard and all across the country where we've got people not only in uniform  but also folks who are working  we've got to make sure that they've got the support  and when our troops take off their uniform  we're going to serve them as well as they've served us  because nobody who fights for this country should ever have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads or the care they need when they come home  my opponent said it was  tragic  to end the war in iraq  i disagree  he won't tell us how he'll end the war in afghanistan  i have  and i will  and while my opponent would spend more money on military programs that our joint chiefs even say won't make us safer and we don't need  i'm going to use that money that we're no longer spending on war to help pay down our debt  and put more people back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our schools and our runways  because after a decade of war  it's time to do some more nation building right here at home  right here in new hampshire  so that's the choice that we now face  and that's what this election comes down to  we keep on getting told that bigger tax cuts  fewer regulations  that that's the only path to prosperity  and that government  because it can't do everything  somehow should almost do nothing  i don't believe that  i don't believe that if you can't afford health insurance  you're on your own  that if companies release toxic pollution into the air that your children breathe  that somehow that's a requirement for economic growth  i don't believe that if you can't afford to go to college  that the best we can do is tell you to borrow money from your parents  that's not who we are  that's not what this country is about  we insist on personal responsibility  we insist on individual initiative  we know we're not entitled to success  we know we've got to earn it  we honor entrepreneurs and businesspeople and strivers and dreamers and the risk takers  we know that that's the driving force behind our free enterprise system  but we also know that this country is built on an idea of citizenship  the idea that we have some obligations to each other and that when we work together we all do better  we've got obligations to future generations  that america is not just about what can be done for us  it's about what can be done by us  together  as one nation and one people  new hampshire  the election   years ago wasn't about me  i told you that last night  it was about you  and it sounds like maybe you were listening because you're here  you were the change  you're the reason that there's a little girl with a heart disorder who will get the surgery she needs because now the insurance companies can't limit her coverage  you're the reason some young person out there is going to be able to go to medical school  because now they can actually afford it  you made that possible  you're the reason that a young immigrant  who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag  is not suddenly going to be deported from the only home they've ever known  you're the reason why we were able to end  don't ask  don't tell  you're the reasons why thousands of families have been able to welcome brave troops  saying   welcome home  you did that  and so now you can't turn away  we can't turn away now  you can't buy into the cynicism that change that we fought so hard for is impossible  you can't give up on the idea that your vote makes a difference  because if you do give up  then the lobbyists and the special interests  they'll fill the void  the folks who are writing the   million checks  the folks running all these super pac ads  the folks who want to tell you who you can marry or tell women that they can't make decisions about their own health care   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  that's who will fill the void if you're not in this  if you're not engaged  if you're not focused  if you're not fighting  we're going to have to work because this is going to be a close election  only you can make sure that we don't go backwards  only you have the power to move us forward  but i'm asking you to use that power  i'm asking you to use that power  i'm asking you for your help  new hampshire  i need you to make some phone calls for me  new hampshire  i need you to knock on some doors for me  new hampshire  i need you to tell your friends and neighbors and coworkers what's at stake in this election  if you're not registered to vote  i need you to register right now  and i need you to turn out in november  because if you do  we're going to finish what we've started  we will create more good jobs  we'll generate more homegrown energy  we'll hire more good teachers  we'll send more young people to college  we'll bring more troops home  we'll take care of more of our vets  we'll open up the doors of opportunity to everybody who's willing to work hard  we will win rockingham county  we will win new hampshire  we will finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  thank you  god bless you  and god bless america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  st  pete's  i am fired up  i am ready to go forward  oh  it is good to be back in florida  it is good how's everybody doing today   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  all right  now  first thing i want to do is make sure everybody is staying hydrated  and if you've been standing here a while  bend your knees  i don't want everybody anybody falling out  i want to thank charlie crist for his introduction  for his support  for showing that the values that we're fighting for are not democratic values or republican values  they are american values  that's what we're fighting for  we've got one of the finest senators in the country  your senator  bill nelson  here  one of the best members of congress that we've got  kathy castor is here  and all of you are here  i'm really excited about that   i audience member i  i love you   i the president i  i love you back  that's why i came  now  we just had our convention in charlotte  north carolina  folks there could not have been more welcoming  michelle what can i say  as the other men in the audience know  our main goal when we marry is to improve our gene pool   i laughter i  that's why my daughters turned out good   i laughter i  because you just you marry up and you marry somebody superior to yourself  and you just you beg them until they marry you   i laughter i  it's just  persistence is the key  and then you've got president clinton who made the case as only he can  after he spoke  somebody sent out a tweet  they said  you should appoint him secretary of explaining stuff   i laughter i  i like that  secretary of explaining stuff  although  i have to admit  it didn't really say  stuff  i cleaned that up a little bit   i laughter i  and then   days ago  i did my best to lay out the stakes in this election  because they are big stakes  both sides have made their arguments now  and i know you have a lot of national republicans in the neighborhood making their argument   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  we've made ours  and so now you've got a big choice to make  and by the way  don't boo  vote  vote  i honestly believe this is the clearest choice of any time in our generation  because it's a choice not just between two candidates or two political parties  this is a choice between two fundamentally different paths for america  two fundamentally different visions for our future  now  ours is a fight on behalf of that basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known  the bargain that says if you work hard it will pay off  the bargain that says responsibility will be rewarded and everybody has got a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same set of rules  from main street to wall street to washington  dc  that's what we're fighting for  that basic bargain is why i ran for president in the first place  because too many jobs were disappearing overseas  too many families were struggling to make the mortgage  to put food on the table  people were having to borrow just for day to day expenses  to fill up the gas tank  and over time  more and more of that debt built up  and then this whole house of cards came tumbling down in the worst economic crisis  the biggest financial crisis since the great depression  and millions of innocent americans lost their jobs and their homes and their life savings  a tragedy that we are still fighting to recover from  now  our friends  at their convention  they were more than happy to talk about everything they think is wrong with america  but they didn't say much about how they'd make it right  they want your vote  but they don't want you to know their plan  and that's because   i audience member i  we want you  president   i the president   i that's because all they've got to offer is the same prescriptions that they've had for   years  tax cuts  tax cuts  gut a few regulations  some more tax cuts  tax cuts when times are good  tax cuts when times are bad  tax cuts to help you lose a few extra pounds i laughter i tax cuts to help your love life   i laughter i   i audience member i  it doesn't help   i laughter i   i the president i  somebody said it doesn't help   i laughter i  you tried those tax cuts  huh   i laughter i  now  listen  actually  it does help when you give it to folks who need it  that's why i've cut taxes for middle class families and for small business owners   times  but i don't believe  and you don't believe  that another round of tax breaks for millionaires is going to bring good jobs back to our shores or pay down our deficit   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i don't believe that firing teachers or kicking students off of financial aid students who go right here to this institution that somehow that's going to help our economy or help us compete with scientists and engineers coming out of china  after all that we have been through  do we really think that it would make sense to roll back regulations on wall street   i audience members i  no   i the president i  that somehow that's going to help small businesswomen expand or laid off construction workers keep their homes   i audience members i  no   i the president i  let me tell you that we have been there  we've tried what they're peddling  it didn't work  we're not going back  we're going forward   i applause i  we are going forward  we are going forward  i won't pretend the path i'm offering is quick or that it's going to be easy  i never have  sometimes  i ask people to go back to   and look at what i said  i said this was going to take some time because these problems have been building up for a long time  bill clinton reminded us on wednesday night  it's going to take more than a few years to solve challenges that have been built up for decades  but let me tell you something  when our opponents say this nation is in decline  they are dead wrong  this is america  we still have the best workers in the world and the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best scientists and the best researchers  we've got the best colleges and the best universities  we are a young nation with the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity from every corner of the globe  so no matter what the naysayers may say for political reasons  no matter how dark they try to make everything look  there's not a country on earth that wouldn't gladly trade places with the united states of america  and i am here to tell you our problems can be solved and our challenges can be met  the path we offer may be harder  but it leads to a better place  and i'm asking you to choose that future  i am asking you to rally not just behind me  but around a set of goals for your country  goals in manufacturing and energy  in education and national security  in reducing our deficit  real  achievable goals that will lead to new jobs and more opportunity and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation  that's what we can do in the next   years  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  that's why i'm asking for   more years   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  i want you to in case you missed it   days ago  i want to repeat in very plain terms what goals i'm talking about   i audience member i  go ahead  mr  president   i the president i  you say i can go ahead  okay  i'm going to go ahead then   i laughter i  number one  i've got a plan to export more products and outsource fewer jobs  after a decade of decline  this country has now created over half a million jobs in the last   years alone just in manufacturing  that's faster than any time since the ' s  we reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world  and now you've got a choice  we can keep giving more tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  just like the other side is arguing for   i audience members i  boo   i the president i or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs right here in florida  we can help big factories and small businesses double their exports and create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  you can make that happen  that's part one  part two  i've got a plan to control more of our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that will save you money  it will help the environment  we've doubled our use of renewable energy  and thousands of americans now have jobs building wind turbines and long lasting batteries  today  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades  think about that  so we're moving to control our own energy  the other side  they don't have a real plan  so you've got a choice between a plan that wants to just reverse the progress we've made or one that builds on it  and let me tell you  unlike my opponent  i'm not going to let oil companies write this country's energy plan or endanger our coastline or collect another   billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers  we're not going to let them do that  we've got a better path  we're going to invest in wind and solar  clean coal technology  we're going to help farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power cars and trucks  we're going to put construction workers back to work building homes and factories that waste less energy and retrofitting old buildings and homes to use less energy  we're developing a hundred years' supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet  if you choose this path  we can cut our imports in half by   and support more than   new jobs in natural gas alone  that's the second part of the plan  you want to hear the third   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  okay  third  i've got a plan to give more americans the chance to gain the skills they need to compete  education was the gateway to opportunity for me and michelle  it's the gateway to a middle class life  for the next time for the first time in nearly a generation  every state just about has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning  some of the worst schools in the country have made real gains in math and reading  including here in florida  millions of students are paying less for college today  including students here  because we took on a system that was wasting billions of dollars giving student loan money to banks and lenders instead of directly to students  so now you've got a choice  we can gut education like these other folks were recommending   i audience members i  no   i the president i  or we can decide that in the united states of america  no child should have her dreams deferred because of a crowded classroom or a crumbling school  no family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money  no company should have to look for workers in china because they couldn't find ones with the right skills right here at home  so help me recruit   math and science teachers in the next   years and improve early childhood education and give   million workers the chance to learn skills at that community college that will lead directly to a job  and let's help work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth of tuition costs over the next   years  because higher education is not a luxury anymore  it is an economic necessity that everybody should be able to afford  and we can meet that goal together  you can choose that future if you're willing to move forward with me  fourth  fourth  my plan yes  i've got four   i laughter i  fourth  my plan would reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class  we're all concerned about the deficit  after two wars  two tax cuts that weren't paid for  we have a challenge that we've got to now deal with   i audience member i  can't go back   i the president i  can't go backwards  independent analysis shows that the plan i've put forward would cut our deficit by   trillion  and i've already worked with republicans to cut   trillion in spending  i'm willing to do more  we've got to make sure government is lean  and programs that don't work  we've got to get rid of them so we can pay for the things that do  and i want to reform the tax code so that it is simple and fair  and so that it asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over   keep in mind  that means if you're a millionaire  you'd still get a tax you'd keep your tax cut for the first    i laughter i  but after that  you'd pay the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  the same rate when we created   million new jobs  the biggest surplus in history and a whole lot of millionaires to boot  and by the way  the reason that i want to keep tax cuts for middle class families but i don't need one  mitt romney doesn't need one is because what happens when middle class families  when teachers and construction workers and receptionists  what happens when folks have a little money in their pocket   i audience members i  they spend it   i the president i  and when they spend it that means business has more customers  and that means business makes more profit  which means business hires more workers  who then spend more money  the whole economy gets stronger  not from the top down  but from the middle out  from the bottom up  that's how we grow an economy   i applause i  that's how we grow an economy  now  this week  president clinton pointed out the single biggest thing missing from my opponent's plan  arithmetic  when governor romney and his allies tell us we can somehow cut our deficit by spending   trillion more on tax breaks for the wealthy  well  you do the math  how is that going to work  the fact is mr  romney's plan and congressman ryan's plan don't add up  and by the way  they don't add to jobs either  they like to talk about how we're going to create more jobs  but economists who've looked at their plan say this would make the recovery slower  not faster  i refuse to let that happen  i refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i refuse to ask all the students here to pay more for college to pay for my tax cut  i'm not going to kick children out of head start programs or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans who are poor or elderly or disabled  all so those with the most can pay less  and by the way  florida  you should know i will never turn medicare into a voucher system  no american should have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  they should retire with the dignity and the respect and the care that they have earned  so yes  we will reform and strengthen medicare for the long haul  that needs to be done  but we're going to do it by reducing the cost of health care  not by just dumping the cost on seniors and asking them to pay more  thousands of dollars more  and while we're at it  we're going to keep the promise of social security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it  and that's not by turning it over to wall street   i audience members i  no   i the president i  now  rebuilding the economy is essential  but everybody knows our prosperity at home is linked to what we do abroad  four years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  i did  i said that we would begin to wind down the war in afghanistan  and we are  a new tower rises above the new york skyline  meanwhile  al qaida is on the path to defeat  and osama bin laden is dead  so we're going to keep moving forward  as long as i'm commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  and when our troops come home and take off their uniform like this veteran right here we will serve them as well as they have served us  because no one who fights for this country should ever have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads or the care that they need when they come home  my opponent has a different view  he said the way i ended the war in iraq was  tragic  he won't tell us how he'll end the war in afghanistan  i have  and i will  and while he wants to spend more money on military programs that the joint chiefs don't even want  say it won't make us safer  i'm going to use some of that money that we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and to put more people back to work rebuilding schools and bridges and runways and roads  because after a decade at war  i think it's time to some nation building here at home  so this is the choice that we face  this is what the election comes down to  over and over  the other side spent all the time they had here in florida saying that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way  they kept on arguing over and over again that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  their basic theory is  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if a company releases toxic pollution into the air that your children breathe  well  that's just the price of progress  if you can't afford to go to college  take my opponent's advice and borrow money from your parents  you know what  that's not who we are  that's not what america is about  america  we believe and insist on personal responsibility  we believe in individual initiative  we know we're not entitled to success  we've got to earn it  we honor the businessmen and the strivers and the dreamers and the risk takers who've always been the driving force behind our free enterprise system  the greatest engine of growth and prosperity that the world has ever known  but you know what  we also believe that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another  to future generations  we believe in the idea of citizenship  the idea that america is not just about what can be done for us  but what can be done by us  together  as one nation  as one people  that's what you believed   years ago  i told you the election wasn't about me  it was about you  and as i look out on this crowd  i am reminded  you were the change  folks here in florida from every walk of life black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  young  old  gay  straight  abled  not disabled listen  you're the reason that seniors across florida are saving an average of   every year on prescription drug because of obamacare  because of health care reform  you did that  by the way  i do care  so i like the term obamacare  mr  romney says he's going to repeal it  which means his plan is  romney don't care  you're the reason  you're the reason that a woman in doral  who's already working full time during the day  can now afford to go to school at night because she's getting the financial aid that she needs  that's because of you and what you did  you're the reason there's a working family from hollywood who was able to save their home from foreclosure  keep their piece of the american dream  you made that possible  you're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home  you're the reason why an outstanding soldier won't be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love  you're the reason why thousands of families have been able to say to loved ones who serve so bravely   welcome home   i audience member i  thanks for bringing me home   i the president i  you're welcome  welcome home  thank you for serving us  and if you turn away now  if you buy into the cynicism that somehow the change we fought for isn't possible  then of course  change won't happen  change won't happen without you  if you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference  then other folks are going to fill the void  the lobbyists  the special interests  the people who are writing   million checks  the folks who are trying to keep people from voting   i audience members i  boo   i the president   i the politicians who want to tell you who you can marry  tell women they can't have control over their own health care choices  only you can make sure that doesn't happen  florida  only you have the power to move us forward  but you've got to use that power  if you're not registered to vote  go to gottaregister com  not  got to gotta  g o t t a register com  if you're not sure about how to vote  go to gottavote com  talk to your friends  talk to your neighbors  talk to your coworkers  don't just talk to people who agree with you  reach out to folks who don't follow politics that closely  talk to somebody who's undecided  talk to some of your republican friends  and talk to them about a vision for the future that moves everybody forward  not just a few  i'm asking for your help  so  florida  can you make some phone calls for me  can you knock on some doors for me  will you tell your friends and neighbors what's at stake in this election  will you register  will you vote  because if you do  we will finish what we started  we'll create more good jobs  we'll generate more homegrown energy  we'll hire more great teachers  we'll send more young people to college  we'll bring home more troops  we'll take care of more veterans  we will open the doors of opportunity to everybody who's willing to work hard and walk through them  we'll win this county  we will win florida  we'll finish what we started and remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  florida  oh  it is good to be in kissimmee  this crowd looks fired up  and they definitely look ready to go  well  first of all  can everybody give a big round of applause to vivian for the great introduction  yay  vivian  it's good to know that we've got one of the finest senators in the country here  your senator bill nelson's in the house  and an outstanding member of congress  corrine brown is here  and all of you are here  all the vips  right here  the listen  i'm having such a great time  anybody who wants to sit down  go ahead and sit down  i'm going to talk for a while   i laughter i  you guys don't sit down because you don't have chairs   i laughter i  but you guys all have to bend your knees a little bit so you don't faint  you've been standing a while  it's a little hot  all right  so   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  the you know  let me just say this  i've got to say  kissimmee  that sometimes when the reception's this good  i just want to say thank you and leave the stage   i laughter i  i mean  how am i going to top this  you guys are being so kind  well listen  we i applause i so you folks look fired up   i applause i   i at this point  the president pretended to leave the stage  he then returned to the podium and continued his remarks as follows i  all right  all right  all right  everybody settle down for a second here   i laughter i  settle down  now  we just had our convention in charlotte  north carolina  and folks could not have been more welcoming  we were so grateful to north carolina and charlotte for throwing a great party  michelle  what can i say  she was amazing  for the young men out there who are not yet married  just give you a tip  you're trying to improve your gene pool  so you marry somebody who is superior to you  that's what i did  and it works good  that way you end up with some good looking kids  smart  talented  president clinton  he made it the case as well as anybody could  somebody tweeted after he spoke  they said  somebody needs to appoint him secretary of explaining stuff   i laughter i  right  he broke it down  secretary of explaining stuff  i love that  and then on the final night  i laid out my case about what's at stake in this election  now  both sides have now made their argument  the other guys  they came down to florida  and so now you know what the choice is  and you've got a big choice to make  and i honestly believe this is the clearest choice of any time in a generation  it is not just a choice between two candidates  it's not just a choice between two parties  it's a choice between two different paths for america  two different visions for our future  now  here's what here's our vision  we're fighting to restore that basic bargain that built the largest middle class the world has ever known  that built the greatest economy the world has ever known  and the whole bargain is real simple  the promise that if you work hard  it will pay off  the promise that if you act responsibly  you'll be rewarded  that everybody in this country gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules  from main street to wall street to washington  dc  now  some of you know i started my career in public service working in the shadow of steel mills that had closed and working with folks trying to rebuild their neighborhoods  and that process of jobs disappearing overseas  families struggling with the costs that keep on going up even though their paychecks aren't going up  people taking more and more debt just to pay for tuition or gas or food on the table that process had been going on for a decade  and then it culminated in the worst financial crisis and depression we've had or recession that we've had since the great depression  and millions of people lost their jobs  lost their homes  lost their savings  and it's that tragedy that we've been fighting to recover from ever since  now  we've made progress  but we know we haven't made enough  we've got more work to do  nobody is satisfied with the status quo  there are too many folks out there who still need a job  too many folks whose homes are still underwater  we've got a lot of work to do  and the question is not whether we need to make more progress  the question is how do we do it  our friends at the republican convention were more than happy to talk about everything they think is wrong with america  but they didn't have much to say about how to make it right  they want your vote  but they don't want you to know their plan  that's because they're offering the same wornout plan that they've had for   years  tax cuts  tax cuts  roll back some regulations  and then let's have some more tax cuts  tax cuts when times are good  tax cuts when times are bad  tax cuts to lose an extra few pounds i laughter i tax cuts to improve your love life   i laughter i  whatever the issue  tax cuts  by the way  when i said that at the last stop we had  in st  petersburg  a guy yelled out in the crowd he said   it didn't work   i laughter i  now  listen  i've cut taxes for folks who need it  in   i promised that we would lower the tax burden on middle class families  and the typical family is paying   less in federal taxes compared to when i came into office  we've cut taxes for small businesses   times  but i don't believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires is going to bring back jobs from overseas or bring down our deficit  i don't think that firing teachers is going to strengthen our economy  or i don't believe kicking students off of financial aid will help us compete against engineers coming out of china  i sure don't believe  after everything we've gone through with the crash on wall street  that rolling back regulations on wall street somehow is going to help local businesses here in florida or strengthen our housing market  we have been there  we have tried that  it didn't work  it didn't work then  it won't work now  we're not going back  we are moving forward  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  we're going forward  we're going forward  forward   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  i won't i will not pretend that the path i'm offering is easy or quick  i didn't promise in   that it was going to be easy or quick  because these problems have been going on for decades  bill clinton made that point on wednesday night  he said you can't expect that we're going to solve these massive challenges that we've been dealing with for years overnight  but let me tell you something  we will solve these problems  you've got my opponent and his vice president saying the nation's in decline  now  i don't know whether they're saying that just because they want to win some votes or because they actually believe it  but either way  they're wrong  america has got the best workers in the world  we've got the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best scientists  the best researchers  the best universities  and the best colleges  we are a young nation  we've got a diversity of talent just like you see in this auditorium  people are coming here from every corner of the globe  why do you think they want to come here  because they know that no matter what the other side says  no matter how dark they try to paint the picture  most folks  they would do anything to have a chance to be right here in the united states of america  so our problems can be solved  our challenges can be met  the path we offer is harder  but it leads to a better place  and i'm asking you to choose that future  i'm asking you to rally not around me  but rally around a set of goals for our country in manufacturing and education and energy  national security  reducing the deficit  i've got a plan that will lead to new jobs and more opportunity and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation  and we can keep making the kinds of progress that's needed over the next   years  which is the reason i'm running for a second term  because i'm confident we can get to where we need to go  i'm confident about it  but in case you missed it  in case you missed what i said what day was that  thursday  what today what day is it today  is it saturday  i mean  i'm just on the road all the time  i forget what date it is  all right  so it was thursday  now it's saturday  in case you missed it on thursday  let me say again what our plan is  first of all  i've got a plan to export more products and outsource fewer jobs  so after a decade of decline  this country created over half a million new manufacturing jobs in the last   years  we reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world  so now you've got a choice  you can go along with the plan you heard in tampa and give more tax breaks to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas   i audience members i  no   i the president i  or we can start giving tax breaks to companies that are opening new plants and training new workers and creating new jobs here in florida  in kissimmee  here in the united states of america  that's my plan  we can help big factories and small businesses double their exports  and by the way  here in florida  you're the gateway for an entire market in latin america  which is why when you hear these folks talking about the recovery act and he didn't do this and he didn't do that  listen  we're expanding ports and infrastructure here in florida precisely because we can export more  we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  because we're selling goods around the world stamped with three proud words  made in the u s a  made in the u s a  made in the u s a  that's part one of our plan  making it here in the united states of america  now   i audience members i  u s a  u s a  u s a   i the president i  u s a   i audience members i  u s a  u s a  u s a   i the president i  all right  so you've got a choice on that issue  let me give you another choice  we need to control more of our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will get twice as go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that will save you money  we've doubled our use of renewable energy  which is not only producing power for businesses and homes here in florida  but it's also creating thousands of jobs building wind turbines and solar panels and long lasting batteries  today  the united states is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades  think about that  think about that  so we that's we've made progress  and now the big idea coming out of tampa was to reverse the progress we've made  that's option one  option two is to build on that progress  so unlike my opponent  i'm not going to let oil companies write this country's energy plan  i'm not going to let them continue to collect   billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers  we've got a better path  we want to keep investing in wind and solar and cleaner coal  and we want farmers and scientists to harness new biofuels to power our cars and our trucks  we want to put construction workers back to work rebuilding factories and homes so they're more energy efficient  so they waste less energy  we can develop a hundred years' supply of natural gas that's beneath our feet here in the united states  and if you choose the path i'm offering  we can cut our oil imports in half by   and we can support   new jobs just in natural gas alone  think about that  but that path is open only if you take it through your vote  all right  so that's two  number three  i've got a plan to give more americans the chance to gain the skills they need to compete  education was a was the key to opportunity for me  it was the key for michelle  it was the key for many of you  it's the gateway to a middle class life  so what have we already done  for the first time in a generation  nearly every state has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning  some of the worst schools in the country have made real gains in math and reading  millions of students are paying less for college because we stopped using banks and lenders as middlemen for student loans  saved billions of dollars  and sent that directly to students to help millions get a better education and not have as much debt  now  you've got a choice  we could reverse some of those things that we've done   i audience members i  no   i the president i  or we can decide in the united states of america  no child should have their dream deferred because of an overcrowded classroom  no family should be excited about a college acceptance letter and then realize  you know what  honey  we can't afford to send you there  no company should have to look for workers in china because they couldn't find workers here in florida or here in the united states that had the skills they needed  so my path is let's recruit and train another hundred thousand math and science teachers  let's improve early childhood education  let's give   million more workers the chance to get better skills at community colleges  skills that will lead directly to a job  and let's work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth in tuition so that everybody can afford it  we can meet that goal together  these are achievable goals  that's the path i want you to choose  number four  we need to reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class  it's important for us to reduce our deficit  it's important for us to do it in a responsible way  we don't have to do it all at once  but we got to get started on it  an independent analysis shows that my plan would cut our deficit by   trillion  and i've worked with republicans in congress to cut a trillion dollars in spending already  and i'm ready to do more  i want to reform the tax code so that it is simple and so that it is fair  i want to get rid of programs that don't work  i want to consolidate some agencies so they're more efficient and more customer friendly  but i also want to ask the wealthiest households to pay a little bit higher taxes on incomes over  over   now  keep in mind  let's say you make a million dollars   i audience member i  yeah   i laughter i   i the president i  so that sounds good to you  right  you'd still keep your tax cut for the first   so it's not like you're not getting any relief at all  the first   you still get your tax break  but for every dollar you make after   we go back to the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  when our economy created   million new jobs  when we had all kinds of small businesses succeeding and starting up  when we had the biggest surplus in history and a lot of millionaires to boot  now  the reason why this works is because this whole top down thing doesn't work  if you give a teacher or a construction worker or a receptionist just working folks if you give them a little more money  what do they do   i audience members i  spend it   i the president i  and if they spend it  then businesses have more customers  and then businesses make more profits  and then the businesses say  let's build another plant and let's hire more workers  and now everything gets rolling in a positive direction  so that's how we build an economy  from the middle out  from the bottom up  it helps everybody when you do it that way  and if you're concerned about the deficit  the first thing you should be concerned about is growing the economy  but let's say even if all you were thinking about is how do we close the deficit gap  as president clinton pointed out  the thing that's missing from my opponent's plan is arithmetic  it doesn't add up  he says that we can give a   trillion tax cut  mostly to wealthy individuals  and that somehow the deficit's going to get smaller  now  how do you think that's going to work  that's not going to work  that's not going to work  and the only way it does work is if you are gutting education  you're stopping you're not investing in basic science and research  where we're not rebuilding our infrastructure and we are fraying our safety net and we're voucherizing medicare   i audience members i  no   i the president   i and maybe  to top it off  we're increasing taxes on middle class families   i audience members i  no   i the president i  that doesn't sound like a good plan   i audience members i  no   i the president i  it doesn't add up   i audience members i  no   i the president i  and by the way  it does not add up to jobs either  some people looked at romney's plan  and they said  you know what  this actually would make the recovery slower  slower  i refuse to let that happen  i refuse to let that happen  i refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for a tax cut for me  i'm not going to ask students to pay more for college or kick kids off head start programs or eliminate health insurance for the poor and the elderly and the disabled so those with the most can pay less  and i want you to know  aarp i want you to know i will never turn medicare into a voucher  these guys are out there running these ads about how somehow we're weakening medicare  we strengthened medicare  extended its life for   years  don't take my word for it  aarp says the same thing  because i believe no american should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  after a lifetime of labor  you should retire with dignity and respect  you've earned it  so we do have to reform and we will strengthen medicare over the long haul  but we're going to do it by reducing the costs of health care  not by dumping those costs onto seniors  and we're going to keep the promise of social security  we'll take responsible steps to strengthen it  not by turning it over to wall street  now  there's one last point i want to make  and that's about foreign policy  because these things are connected  our prosperity at home is linked to our policies abroad  four years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  we did  i said we'd wind down the war in afghanistan  and we are  while a new tower rises above the new york skyline  as we come up on september   we know that al qaida is on the path to defeat and usama bin laden is dead  so i want you to know  as long as i'm commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  when our troops take off the uniform  we will serve them as well as they've served america  nobody who fights for this country should ever have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  now  my opponent's got a different view  he said it was  tragic  for me to end the war in iraq as i did  well  i did it anyway   i laughter i  he won't tell us how he'll end the war in afghanistan  in fact  didn't even mention it in his speech at his convention  my opponent would spend more money on military programs that our joint chiefs don't even want  won't make us safer  i'm going to use that money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways  let's do some nation building here at home  that will make us safer   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  so that's what this election comes down to  there's a choice on every issue  over and over we've been told by the other side that bigger tax cuts  fewer regulations  they're the only way to go  that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  their basic theory is if you can't afford health insurance  don't get sick   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  a company releases pollution in the air that our children breathe  well  that's the price of progress  if you can't afford college  take their advice and ask your parents if you can borrow the money   i laughter i  i've got a different idea  because i don't think that's what our country is about  we insist on hard work and personal responsibility and individual initiative  and we know we're not entitled to success  we've got to earn it  we honor the strivers and the dreamers and the entrepreneurs  the risk takers who've always been the driving force behind our free enterprise system  and we believe it that free enterprise system is the greatest engine of growth and prosperity the world's ever known  that's what attracts people to our shores  but we also believe that the market doesn't work  this country doesn't work  unless we accept certain obligations to one another  unless we're thinking about future generations  unless we believe in something called citizenship  that we understand america is not just about what can be done for us  it's about what can be done by us  together  as one nation and one people  so the election   years ago  it wasn't about me  it was about you  you're the change  the american people rose up  and as a result of what you did  seniors across florida are saving an average of   every year on prescription drugs  that's because of obamacare  you did that  you're the reason a woman in doral  who is already working full time during the day  now can afford to go to school at night because she's got the financial aid that she needs  you did that  you're the reason there's a working family over in hollywood who was able to save their home from foreclosure and keep their piece of the american dream  you made that possible  you're the reason that a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home  you're the reason why we ended  don't ask  don't tell  you're the reason why our troops are coming home  you made that happen  you made that happen  don't let anybody tell you you can't make a difference  don't let anybody tell you that somehow you have no influence  that you can't change the system  we may not be able to change everything all at once just the way we want it  because this is a big  complex democracy  and not everybody has got a same opinion  and there's nothing wrong with that  and yes  sometimes things get tangled up in washington  and sometimes it's frustrating and change isn't happening the way it should  but whenever the american people stand up  whenever you get involved  whenever you participate  then amazing things happen  because the american people have great instincts  you are a good and decent people  and so if you turn away now  if you turn away now  and you buy into the cynicism that you won't make a difference  well  of course  change won't happen  you know who will fill the void  who will step in where you should have been  lobbyists  special interests  the folks writing the   million checks trying to buy this election  the folks who are trying to make it harder for people to vote   i audience members i  no   i the president i  washington politicians who want to control who you can marry  want to control health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making themselves  you can't let that happen   i audience members i  no   i the president i  you can't let that happen   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i'm talking to you   i laughter i  only you have the power to move us forward  but that depends on you using that power  i'm asking you for your help  i'm asking for your vote  i'm asking you to make phone calls  i'm asking you to knock on some doors  i'm asking you to talk to your neighbors and talk to your friends and talk to your coworkers  i'm asking you to stand up  i'm asking you to be heard  and if you do  we will win florida and we will win this election  we'll finish what we started  and you and i together will march into that better future  let's make it happen  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  melbourne  how's it going  florida  thank you   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  well  look  i am so thrilled to be here  it is good to be back in florida  and i am so grateful to mary  not only for her introduction  but for sharing her story  for fighting on behalf of america  for reminding that the values we care about aren't democratic or republican values  but are american values  so give mary a big round of applause  now  but before i start i have a very important announcement that i've got to make   i audience member i  i love you  president obama   i the president i  i love you too   i applause i  i do  actually  there are three things i've got to say before i get started  first of all  if you've got a seat feel free to take a seat  because i'm going to talk for a while  point number two is if you don't have a seat  bend your knees because sometimes people faint a little bit  all right  and you've been standing here a while  the third thing i want to say  the most important thing i have to say is  football starts today  so we intend to be finished to get home in time for kickoff  i don't know i know you've got a lot of teams here in florida  but in illinois  there's just one team  the chicago bears   i audience members i  boo   i laughter i   i the president i  all right  well  let me move on to another topic then   i laughter i  it is so great to be here  we just had our convention in charlotte  north carolina  folks there could not have been more welcoming  michelle was michelle  she was amazing  so for the young men out there who are thinking about their futures  the goal is to marry up and improve your gene pool   i laughter i  and that's what i have done by marrying michelle  then you have president clinton who made the case the only way that he can  somebody sent out a tweet after he spoke  he said  somebody needs to make him secretary of explaining stuff i laughter i which i liked  i liked that  and then  on thursday night  i spoke about the stakes in this election  now  you've now heard both sides make their argument  and i hope you know at this point  there's a big choice to make  and it is the clearest choice of any time in a generation  it is not just a choice between two candidates  it's not just a choice between two parties  it is a choice between two fundamentally different paths for america  two very different visions for our future  and our fight is for that basic bargain that built the middle class in this country and the strongest economy the world's ever known  and it was basically a simple idea  the idea that here in america hard work will pay off  that here in america  responsibility will be rewarded  that everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules  from wall street to main street to washington  dc  and that basic bargain is why i ran for president  because i saw too many jobs disappearing overseas  too many families struggling with the costs that keep on going up even though paychecks aren't going up  too many people racking up more and more debt just to make the mortgage or pay tuition or put gas in the car or food on the table  and when this house of cards collapsed in this great recession  we saw millions of innocent americans lose their jobs  lose their homes  lose their savings  and we're still trying to recover from that tragedy  now  our friends at the republican convention  they were more than happy to talk about everything that they think is wrong with america  but they didn't have much to say about how to make it right  they want your vote  but they don't have a plan  or at least  they don't want to tell you their plan  and that's because they've got the same plan they've had for   years  tax cuts  tax cuts  gut a few regulations  and then give some more tax cuts  tax cuts when times are good  tax cuts when times are bad  tax cuts to help you lose a few extra pounds i laughter i tax cuts to improve your love life   i laughter i  i said that at the last event yesterday  and somebody yelled out  i tried it  and it didn't work   i laughter i  now  listen  i've given tax cuts to folks who need it  four years ago  i promised i would cut taxes for middle class families   i audience members i  and you did   i the president i  and i did  the typical family is paying   less in federal taxes since i've been president  we've cut taxes for small businesses   times  but i don't believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires are going to bring good jobs to our shores or pay down the deficit  just like i don't think that firing teachers or kicking students off of financial aid is going to help grown an economy  that's not going to help us compete with china and other countries that are coming up  after all we've been through  i sure don't believe rolling back regulations we put in place to make sure wall street doesn't act recklessly  that rolling those regulations back somehow will help small business women here in florida or laid off construction workers get back to work  let me tell you  florida  what they are selling we are not buying  we've been there  we've tried it  it's not working  we're not going back  we're moving forward  that's why i'm running for a second term for president of the united states  now  i will not pretend that the path i'm offering is quick or easy  it's going to take more than a few years to deal with problems that have been building up for decades  but let me tell you something  when our opponent goes around saying that the nation is in decline  he doesn't know what he's talking about  this is america  we've got the best workers in the world  the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best scientists and researchers in the world  we've got the best colleges and universities in the world  we are a young nation  we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity  people want to come here from every corner of the globe  so no matter what the naysayers tell us  no matter what they how dark they try to make things look for election time  there's not another country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states  so i promise you our problems can be solved and our challenges can be met  the path we offer may be harder  but it will lead to a better place  and i'm asking you to choose that future  i'm asking you to rally around some goals  concrete  achievable goals in manufacturing and energy  and education  in reducing our deficit that will lead to new jobs and more opportunity  and it will rebuild our economy on a stronger foundation  that's what the next   years are about  that's why i'm running for president  that's why i need your support   i applause i  that's why i need your support  now  just in case some of you missed me on thursday  i want to be i want to lay out once again what i'm talking about with this plan  first  i've got a plan to export more products and send fewer jobs overseas  after a decade of decline  this country has actually created more than half a million new manufacturing jobs over the last   years  we reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world  here on the space coast  we started a new era of american exploration that is creating good jobs right here in this county  we've begun an ambitious new direction for nasa by laying the groundwork for  st century space flight and innovation  and just last month  we witnessed an incredible achievement that speaks to the nation's sense of wonder and our can do spirit  the united states of america landing  i curiosity i  on mars  so this is an example of what we do when we combine our science  our research  our ability to commercialize new products  making them here in america  so this is where we've got a choice  we could  as the house republican budget proposes  cut back on research and technology   i audience members i  no   i the president i  or we can continue to be at the cutting edge  because that's what we've always been about  we can spark new discoveries  launch new careers  inspire the next generation to reach for something better  you've got that choice  we can make sure that not only are we investing in great research  but the products that come out of that research are made here in the united states  we can change our tax code so we stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's reward them for investing in new plants and equipment here in the u s  and training new workers here in the u s  and keeping the research and development here in the u s  and creating jobs right here in the u s  making products that we sell around the world stamped with three proud words  made in the u s a  that's what we're fighting for  that's the future we want   i audience members i  u s a  u s a  u s a   i the president i  u s a  we can help big factories and small businesses double their exports  and that creates jobs  and we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  and by the way  here in florida  you are a gateway for this huge latin american market that's growing  which is why  during the recovery act  we helped local communities revamp their ports and their roads so that we can move more products onto those container ships that are sending goods down to brazil and mexico and other parts argentina  and all across our hemisphere  and that's also why  by the way  we're attracting more tourists from this region  we made it easier for folks to come visit florida  because that creates jobs right here in florida  so this is all part of the notion that we don't want to just borrow and spend  we also want to make stuff and sell  that's part one of the plan  part two  i've got a plan to control more of our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars or trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that will save you money  and it will help the environment  we've doubled our use of renewable energy  thousands of americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long lasting batteries and solar panels that are being used right here in florida to generate energy  i want you guys to know this  today  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades  so now you've got a choice between a plan that reverses this progress or one that builds on it  unlike my opponent  i'm not going to let oil companies write this country's energy plan or endanger our coastlines or collect another   billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers  we've got a better path  where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal technology and farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and our trucks and where we put construction workers back to work building factories that waste less energy  retrofitting schools and hospitals and buildings so that they're using less energy  where we developed a hundred years' supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet  and if we choose this path  we can cut our oil imports in half by   and that alone will support   new jobs in natural gas  we can move forward  but we can't go backwards  that's what the next   years are about  part three  part three  i've got a plan to give more americans the chance to gain the skills they need to compete  education was the key to opportunity for me  for michelle  for many of you  and so we focused on this the minute i came into office  and for the first time in a generation  nearly every state has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning  and some of the worst schools in the country have made real progress and real gains in math and reading  millions of students  including some students at this institution  are paying less today for college because we took on a system that was wasting billions of taxpayer dollars sending it to banks  we said let's send it directly to students  and students are paying less for their college education because of it  so now you've got a choice  we   i audience member i  you're our choice   i the president i  that's a good choice  we can gut our investment in education  as the budget being proposed by the other side would do  or we can decide in the united states of america  no child should have their dream deferred because of an overcrowded classroom or outdated textbooks  no family should have to set aside an acceptance letter for college because they realize  you know what  honey  we just can't afford it  no company should have to look for workers in some other country because they couldn't find the workers with the right skills right here in the united states  so we've got to focus on this  help me recruit   new math and science teachers and improve early childhood education and give   million workers the chance to learn skills at their local community college that will lead directly to a job  and help me work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth of tuition costs over the next   years  we can meet that goal together  we can help the next generation  we can choose that future for america  but i can only do it with you  and you know what  let's make sure that we're reducing our deficit without sticking it to the middle class  now  independent analysis says that my plan for reducing our deficits would lower them by   trillion that's with a  t  trillion  and i've worked with republicans in congress already to cut a trillion dollars in spending  and i'm willing to do more  i want to work with them  i want a tax code that's fair and simpler  but i also want to ask folks like me and mr  romney  the wealthiest households in america  the top   percent  to just pay a little bit more  higher taxes on incomes over the first   of their income to help reduce our deficit  that's the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  and we created   million new jobs  the biggest surplus in history and a whole lot of millionaires to boot  we can do that  and by the way  i just want to be clear  under my plan  first of all    percent of folks who make less than   you wouldn't see your income taxes go up a single dime  all right  because you're the ones who need relief  and what happens when you've got a little more money in your pocket  what happens   i audience members i  we spend it   i the president i  you spend it  maybe you buy a new computer for your son or daughter  maybe you buy a new car after   years of driving that old beater around  and what happens  when you spend  then businesses have more customers  and then they make more profit  and then they hire more workers  who then  in turn  go buy more products  that's how we grow an economy  not from the top down  from the middle out  from the bottom up  that's the choice in this election  but what we heard in tampa well  they didn't really say much about it  but what you see on their web site  what you've seen republicans in congress vote on is a different kind of plan  president clinton pointed out that the single biggest thing missing from my opponent's plan is arithmetic  math  governor romney and his allies tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions of more dollars on new tax breaks for the wealthy   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i mean  listen  you've got to do the math  because when my opponents were asked about it today  they couldn't   i laughter i  it was like two plus one equals five   i laughter i  they couldn't answer questions about how they'd pay for   trillion in new tax cuts and   trillion in new defense spending without raising taxes on the middle class  that's not bold leadership  that's bad math  that gets a failing grade  i refuse to go along with that plan  i refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another tax cuts for somebody like me or mr  romney  i refuse to ask students to pay more for college  or kick children out of head start programs just to give millionaires a tax break  i'm not going to eliminate health insurance for millions of americans who are poor or elderly or disabled  all so those with the most can pay less  and i want you to know  florida  i will never turn medicare into a voucher  you know  i had a wonderful breakfast with two retired couples over at cocoa jerry and jan and john and shirley they're here somewhere  there they are  they're over there  and that was a good breakfast  too  wasn't it  it was outstanding  and they were wise enough to move to florida after they retired because they were living in very cold weather  and they love it here  but we were talking about how  after a lifetime of work  they've been able to save enough to have a comfortable retirement  but that's only because medicare is there rock solid for them  only because we have made that commitment that says if you work hard all your life  then you should have some basic security  not to live lavishly  but to know that it's going to be there for you  and i have to tell you  that is going to be part of what's at stake in this election  now  i've already strengthened medicare  we've already added years to the life of medicare by getting rid of taxpayer subsidies to insurance companies that weren't making people any healthier and  in fact  were making things more expensive for everybody  so we used part of those savings to help lower the cost of prescription drugs and offer free preventive care to seniors  i thought that was a good idea  for some reason  my opponents think it's a bad idea  so they want to give the money back to the insurance companies and then put them in charge of medicare   i audience members i  no   i the president i  in fact  one report just said that by the end of the next decade  our opponents' plan would mean as much as   billion to   billion in new profits for insurance companies  so basically  your costs would rise by the thousands so that their profits could rise by the billions   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  so here's the bottom line  their voucher plan for medicare would bankrupt medicare  our plan strengthens medicare  no american should have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  they should retire with the dignity and the respect and the care that they have earned  yes  we will reform and strengthen medicare for the long haul  but we'll do it by reducing the cost of health care  not by dumping those costs onto seniors  we're not going to do that  and while we're at it  we're going to keep the promise of social security by taking responsible steps to strengthen it  not by turning it over to wall street  and by the way  if you're wondering who is right on this argument about medicare   i audience members i  you are   i the president i  no  no  but in case some of your friends are wondering  let's put it that way   i laughter i  i mean  keep in mind that the aarp  which knows a little bit about this  they took a look at our plan when we passed obamacare  and they confirmed that it strengthens medicare  and when you look at their plan  it's confirmed that over time a voucher system will weaken medicare as we know it  now   i audience member i  that's why we need a new governor   i the president i  i'm talking about the federal election right now   i laughter i  now  rebuilding this economy is essential  but  as mary said  our prosperity at home is also linked to our security and our policies abroad  so i just want to remind everybody    years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  i did  we said we'd wind down the war in afghanistan  and we are doing that  and a few days before   a new tower is rising above the new york skyline  we're coming back  meanwhile  al qaida is on the path to defeat  and usama bin laden is dead  so i just want you to remember when my opponent and his vice presidential nominee are running around saying somehow we're weakening our military  let me tell you  as long as i'm commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  when our troops take off their uniforms  we will serve them as well as they have served us  because nobody should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home after serving on behalf of the united states  but we've got some disagreements  my opponent says it was  tragic  for me to end the iraq war the way i did  i think he's wrong  he won't tell us how he'll end the war in afghanistan  i have  my opponent wants to spend more money on military programs that our joint chiefs don't even want  i'll use that money that we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and to put more people back to work rebuilding roads and schools and bridges  after a decade of war  we need to do some nation building here at home  that's what we're going to do  so  florida  that's the choice that we now face  that's the choice that you face  over and over we have been told by our opponents that the only answer  the only way are bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations  shrink government  because their basic idea is that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if there's some toxic pollutant that's going into the air that our kids breathe  well  that's the price of progress  if you can't afford to go to college  borrow some money from your parents   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  that's what he said  it's amazing that you guys didn't think of that  students   i laughter i  but you know what  that's not who we are  as americans  we insist on personal responsibility and individual initiative  we know you've got to work hard  we know you're not entitled to success  you've got to earn it  and we honor the small businesspeople and the strivers and the dreamers and the risk takers who've been the driving force between our free enterprise system  the greatest engine of growth and prosperity that the world has ever known  but we also believe that this country works only because we also accept certain obligations to one another  because we think about future generations  as citizens  we understand it's not about what can be done for us  but what can be done by us  together as a nation  together as one people  and those of you who were with me in '  you understand this because that election was about you  you brought about change  you're the reason seniors across florida are saving an average of   every year on their prescription drugs because of obamacare  you did that  you're the reason a woman in doral  who's already working full time during the day  can now afford to go to school at night because she's getting the financial aid that she needs  you're the reason there's families in florida who are able to save their homes from foreclosure  and keep that piece of the american dream  you made that possible  you're the reason why young immigrants who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag are no longer going to be deported from the only home they've ever known  you're the reason we ended  don't ask  don't tell  so anybody who loves this country can serve this country  you're the reason why families are welcoming back our brave soldiers  saying   welcome home  so  florida  you can't turn back now   i audience members i  no   i the president i  we can't give into the cynicism that the other side is peddling  because what happens  if you give up on the idea that your voice matters  then somebody is going to fill that void  oil companies will write our energy plans  the drug companies and the insurance companies  they'll write our health care plans  the folks who are writing the   million checks who are buying this election  the people who are trying to make it harder for you to vote  the folks who want to tell you who to marry  the people who are trying to tell women that they can't make up their own minds about their health care choices they're the folks who are going to be filling that void if you don't step up  but if you claim the power that you have  if you are determined to move us forward  the american people cannot be stopped  and i tell you  we've got a lot more work to do  we've got more good jobs to create  we've got more good schools to build  more great teachers to hire  more troops to bring home  more veterans to take care of  and if you will make some phone calls for me and knock on some doors with me  talk to your neighbors and your friends about what's at stake  if you'll register to vote and make sure you turn out to vote  then we will finish what we started  we will open the doors of opportunity to all who are willing to work hard to walk through them  we will win florida  we will win this election  and you and i together will remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  west palm beach  oh  it is good to be back  you know what  you guys sound pretty fired up  you sound like you might be ready to go  i'm telling you  well   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  it is good to be back  it is good to see some great friends in the house  we've got your outstanding senator bill nelson in the house  we've got your mayor  jeri muoio  in the house  we've got congressman ted deutch in the house  and the chairwoman of the democratic party  our great friend  debbie wasserman schultz is in the house  and all of you are in the house  now  we just had our convention in charlotte  north carolina  the people could not have been nicer  michelle  she was pretty good  so i want to give advice to young men out there  when you marry  you marry up  you improve the gene pool   i laughter i  president clinton was amazing  somebody sent out a tweet right after he spoke  they said  he needs to be made secretary of explaining stuff   i laughter i  and then  on thursday  i laid out the stakes in this election  now  i know i may be preaching a little bit to the choir  but i laughter i but i want you to know i'm going to need you to then go out and preach to the unconverted  both sides have now made their arguments  and there's a choice that we've got to make  and it's the clearest choice we've seen in a generation  not just between two candidates or two parties  but a choice between two fundamentally different visions of our future  we want to restore the basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world's ever known  a bargain that says hard work pays off  that responsibility is rewarded  that everybody does their fair share and everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is playing by the same rules  from main street to wall street to washington  dc  that's the basic bargain that led me to run for president  it's what allowed me and michelle to have extraordinary opportunities in our lives  and we want to make sure the next generation has those same opportunities  and we had just gone through a decade in which jobs were being shipped overseas  and families were having trouble making ends meet  and they were having to rack up more debt just to pay tuition or fill up a gas tank  and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  we spent the last   years trying to recover from all the damage that was done  and we've made progress  but not enough  we've got more to do  and so now the question is  which direction do we go   i audience members i  forward   i the president i  now  the republicans  they disagree with you   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  no  don't boo  vote   i applause i  vote   i audience member i  i love you  obama   i the president i  i love you back  they had their convention here in florida and they talked a lot about me   i laughter i  but they didn't talk a lot about you  they talked about everything they think is wrong with america  but they didn't really talk about how to make it right  they want your vote  but they didn't really talk about their plan  and that's because their plan boils down to tax cuts  tax cuts  gut a few regulations  and then some more tax cuts   i laughter i  tax cuts when times are good  tax cuts when times are bad  tax cuts when we've got a surplus  tax cuts when we have a deficit  tax cuts to help you lose a few pounds i laughter i tax cuts to improve your love life   i laughter i  whatever is wrong with you  they think tax cuts  especially for folks at the top  will cure all ills  now  i've cut taxes for folks who need it  for middle class families  for small businesses  but i don't believe another round of tax cuts for millionaires are going to bring jobs back from overseas  i don't think another round of tax cuts for billionaires that involve slashing aid to students to pay for it or asking middle class families to pay more  that somehow that's going to reduce the deficit or help grow our economy  i certainly don't think that it makes a lot of sense for us to be looking at creating a voucher for medicare to pay for some tax cuts for folks who don't need them and weren't even asking for them  that's not who we are  that's not how we made progress in this country  i don't think rolling back regulations on wall street so that we don't have another taxpayer funded bailout is a smart idea  i don't think rolling back health care that is helping americans all across florida and all across the country is a good idea  i don't want to go backwards  we have been there  we have done that  it didn't work  we're moving forward  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i applause i  forward   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  i won't pretend that the path i'm offering is easy  i never have  these problems built up over decades  they're going to take more than a few years to solve  but we can move forward in the right direction  and i am confident we've got what it takes  our opponents  they've been talking about how america is in decline  they're wrong  we've got the best workers in the world  the best businesspeople in the world  we've got the best universities in the world  the best researchers in the world  we're a young nation  we're a diverse nation  we attract talent from every corner of the globe  so no matter how much the other side  for political reasons  tries to paint things as bleak  don't believe them  there's not another nation on earth that wouldn't trade places with us  our problems can be solved  our challenges can be met  the path i offer is harder  but it leads to a better place  i am asking you to choose that future  i am asking you to go forward with me   i applause i  i am asking you to go forward with me  and let me tell you exactly let me repeat  for those of you who didn't catch it on thursday  what i'm talking about when i say  moving forward  we are going to put together a real  achievable plan to build this economy on a stronger foundation  it starts with no longer shipping jobs overseas  let's export goods made here in america  after a decade of decline  we've now created half a million jobs over the last   years just in manufacturing  we reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on top  so we can take mr  romney's advice and continue to give even more tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  or we can reward companies that are investing in new jobs and new workers and new factories here in the united states of america  that's what we're fighting for  i want to help american factories and small businesses export more  we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  you can make that happen  second part of our plan  let's control our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on the same gallon of gas  that's good for your pocketbook  it's good for the environment  we've doubled our use of renewable energy like wind and solar  today  thousands of americans have jobs building wind turbines and long lasting batteries  and today  the united states is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades  so you have a choice  we can build on that progress  or we can reverse it like my opponent recommends   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i think he's wrong  don't boo  vote  unlike my opponent  i don't intend to let oil companies write our country's energy plan or endanger our coastlines  and i don't want them to keep collecting   billion of corporate welfare from our taxpayers  we've got a better path  we keep investing in wind and solar  clean coal technology  farmers and scientists harnessing new biofuels to power our cars and trucks  construction workers building homes and factories that are more energy efficient  developing a hundred years' supply of natural gas  we can cut our oil imports in half by   and support more than   new jobs in natural gas alone  that's moving forward  we're not going backwards  third  we're going to build on the reforms we have initiated and make sure that americans are getting the chance to get the skills they need to compete in this  st century economy  education was the key to opportunity for me  the key to opportunity for michelle  the key to opportunity for many of you  it's the gateway to a middle class life  and that's why  for the first time in a generation  we pushed every state almost  to answer our call to raise standards for teaching and learning some of the worst schools in the nation have made real gains in reading and math  millions of students are saving money  paying less for college  because of the work we did to keep the student loan program on track and improve the pell grant program  so you can take their advice and gut education  or we can decide in the united states  no child should have her dream deferred because of an overcrowded classroom or because a family can't afford to send her to college  no company should have to look for a worker someplace else because they couldn't find the right skills for workers here in the united states  so i need you to help me recruit   new math and science teachers  improve early childhood education  let's provide   million more workers the chance to learn skills at community colleges for jobs that are out there right now  and let's work with colleges and universities to lower tuition  because it is not a luxury for young people  it is a necessity  that's what i mean when i say we need to move forward  not backwards  we can meet these goals together  my plan would reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class  independent analysis shows my plan would reduce our deficit by   trillion  we've got the math all done  we've laid it out there  people have evaluated it  people have analyzed it  i've already worked with the republicans in congress to cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending  and i'm willing to do more with republicans  i want to reform our tax code so that's it's simple and it's fair  but i also think it makes sense for folks like me to pay higher taxes on our incomes over   the same rate bill clinton had when he was president  the same rate that created   million new jobs  the biggest budget surplus in history  a lot of millionaires to boot  now  i guess my opponent has a plan  but there's one thing missing from it   i audience member i  arithmetic   i the president i  arithmetic  give that young lady an  a  she's been doing her homework  when governor romney and his allies in congress say that the most important thing is to lower our deficit  and then he starts by calling for trillions of dollars more in new tax breaks for wealthy folks  and they were asked about it today  they couldn't answer   i laughter i  they couldn't answer the question of how  you already have deficits  you add   trillion of new tax cuts    trillion in new defense spending  and somehow you're going to close the deficit without raising taxes on middle class families  they did not take their arithmetic course  they need to talk to this young lady and get some tutoring  they need to stay after school  they need to get some extra study hall in there  no recess for you   i laughter i  look  i refuse to go along with a plan that asks middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children out of head start programs or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans who are poor and elderly or disabled just so those with the most can pay less  and and i want you to hear me now i will never turn medicare into a voucher  we won't do that  here's what you need to know  i have strengthened medicare  we've added years to the life of medicare  we did it by getting rid of taxpayer subsidies to insurance companies that weren't making people healthier  the other side knows that  in fact  it was in their budget  all the savings we achieved  now they're pretending like somehow it affected beneficiaries when they know it doesn't  we took that money that was going to the insurance companies  used part of it to help lower prescription drug costs for seniors  to offer free preventive care for seniors  we thought that was a good idea  they may think it's a bad idea  but i don't  they want to give the money back to the insurance companies  put them in charge of medicare   i audience members i  no   i the president i  there was one report that just said that by the end of the next decade under their plan  you would see as much as   to   billion in new profits for insurance companies  paid for by taxpayers  why would we do that  the cost to folks who are currently on medicare could rise by thousands of dollars so that insurance companies are making those billions of dollars in profits  that's not a good plan   i audience members i  no   i the president i  so here's the bottom line  their plan bankrupts medicare over the long term and  actually  over the short term  means the trust fund runs out of money by   our plan strengthens medicare  i believe no american should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  i believe every american who works hard should be able to retire with the dignity that they have earned  and i want to be honest with you  we're going to have to strengthen medicare for the long haul  and that requires some reforms  but we'll do it by reforming the way that health care delivery system works so that we're reducing the costs of health care  not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more  and we're going to keep the promise of social security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it  not by turning it over to wall street  now  our prosperity at home is linked to our policies abroad  and i've got a track record that you can look at  i said i'd end the war in iraq  i did  i said we'd begin bringing troops home from afghanistan  and we are  and while a new tower rises above the new york skyline  and as we pause to remember those that were lost this coming tuesday on september   we know that al qaida is on the path to defeat and usama bin laden is dead  so we've got a track record that you can look at  and as long as i'm commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  our troops when they take off those uniforms  we will serve them as well as they've served us  because they shouldn't have to fight for a job when they come home  but my opponent has a different idea  he said the way we ended the war in iraq was  tragic  doesn't have a plan to end the war in afghanistan  but you know what  if you don't even mention afghanistan  that's a problem when you accept the nomination  so i'm assuming he doesn't have a plan  and while my opponent would spend more money on military programs that our joint chiefs don't even want  at a time when we're supposed to be reducing our deficit  i'd use the money that we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work rebuilding bridges and roads and schools and runways  we need to do some nation building here at home  that's what we need to do  so that's the choice we now face  that's what this election comes down to  the other side says bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way  they basically argue  you know what  since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  if you don't have health care  hope you don't get sick  if you can't afford college  borrow money from your parents   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  that's what he said  i mean  i quoted him  i didn't make that up   i laughter i  we've got a different idea  that's not what america is about  we believe in individual initiative  we believe you're not entitled to success  you've got to earn it  we believe in hard work  we believe in rewarding the dreamers and the risk takers and the strivers  the small businesspeople who make this country run  we believe in the free enterprise system  but we also believe we've got obligations to one another  we also believe this country only works when we're thinking about future generations  not just this one  we understand america is not just about what can be done for us  but what can be done by us  together  as one people  as one nation  that's what we believe  that's what we mean when we say we're going forward  four years ago  years ago because you believed  because of your efforts  we were able to bring about change we hadn't seen in decades  you're the reason that seniors here in florida are paying about   less for prescription drugs because of obamacare  you did that  you're the reason that there are folks all across this state who can now afford to go to college  you're the reason that happened  you're the reason that all across this state  people who were in danger of losing their homes were able to stay in their homes  that's because of you  you made that possible  you're the reason that a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledges allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the country that they love  you're the reason we ended  don't ask  don't tell  you're the reason that families are able to say to their loved ones who served so bravely   welcome home  you're the reason  but we've got a long way to go  and you know  sometimes on a journey you get tired  and there will be voices that whisper in your head to be cynical  to think you can't make it  you've got to turn that away  you can't buy into that cynicism  the notion that change isn't possible  because if you don't believe it  it won't happen  if you give up  then the other voices will fill the vacuum  the lobbyists and the special interests  the folks who are writing the   million checks to run all those negative ads   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  the folks who are trying to make it harder for you to vote  washington politicians who want to decide who can get married  and control choices that women should be making about their own health care  that's what's going to fill the vacuum  we can't let that happen  florida  we've come too far to turn back now  if you're not registered to vote  i need you to register  go to

also want to say it's good to see your once and next congresswoman  dina titus  and it is so good to see all of you   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  i do  now  i wanted to begin   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  so i wanted to begin tonight by just saying a few words about a tough day that we've had today  we lost four americans last night  who were killed when they were attacked at a diplomatic post in libya  and they were serving overseas on our behalf  despite the dangers  despite the risks  to help one of the world's youngest democracies get on its feet  they were working to advance the interests and the values that we hold dear as americans  and as americans  we stand united all of us in gratitude for their service  and we are mindful of their sacrifice  and we want to send out heartfelt prayers to their loved ones who grieve today  it's a reminder that the freedoms we enjoy sometimes even the freedoms we take for granted they're only sustained because there are people like those who were killed who are willing to stand up for those freedoms  who are willing to fight for those freedoms  in some cases to lay down their lives for those freedoms  so tonight let's think of them and thank them  as for the ones we lost last night  i want to assure you  we will bring their killers to justice  and we want to send a message all around the world  anybody who would do us harm  no act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world  and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the united states of america  we will not be deterred  we will keep going  we will keep going because the world needs us  we are the one indispensable power in the world  and if we are going to see peace and security for our children and our grandchildren  then that means that this generation of americans has to lead  we're going to have to keep doing the work  no matter how hard it seems sometimes  and that's what i want to talk to you about here today  we've got work to do overseas  we've also got to do some work here at home  and we've got to do some work right here in the great state of nevada  now  because nevada is a battleground state  you are aware that we've got an election going on  unless you've accidentally stumbled in here looking for a convention of podiatrists i laughter i then you've been paying some attention to the election  both parties just came out with their conventions  each side made its case  and now you're choice facing a very big choice  see  our vision  what we're fighting for  the reason all of you are here today  is because we believe in the basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known  it's a bargain that says hard work will pay off  that if you act responsibly  you'll be rewarded  that everybody gets a fair shot  everybody does their fair share  everybody plays by the same rules  from main street to wall street to washington  dc  that it doesn't matter where you come from or what you look like or what your last name is  here in america you can make it if you try  that's what we believe in  and that basic bargain is why i ran for president in the first place and why so many of you worked hard to get me elected president  we had seen for a decade too many jobs disappearing overseas  we had seen too many families struggling while costs were going up but paychecks weren't going up  people racking up more debt just to pay the mortgage or pay tuition or put gas in the car or food on the table  and these misguided policies led to the biggest recession we've seen since the great depression  millions of innocent americans  especially here in nevada  lost their homes  their jobs  their savings  and we are still fighting to recover from that  nevada got hit harder than most  but here's the thing  i don't think the best answers for today's new challenges are old sales pitches  and that's what my opponent and the other side have been selling  you guys heard it  i mean  you may not have watched their convention  but if you didn't  let me summarize  what they said was  we want to give you more tax cuts  especially tilted towards the wealthy  and everything will be okay   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and this is their prescription for everything  tax cuts in good times  tax cuts in bad times  tax cuts when we're at peace  tax cuts when we're at war  tax cuts to help you lose those few extra pounds i laughter i tax cuts to give your love life that extra kick   i laughter i  now  listen  i've cut taxes  but i cut them for folks who needed them  we cut taxes for middle class families  we cut taxes for small business owners  but i sure do not believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs back to our shores  i don't believe that it will bring down our deficit  i don't think that firing teachers or kicking students off of financial aid will grow our economy  i don't think that will help us compete when china is churning out more engineers and scientists  after all we've been through  does anybody actually believe that rolling back regulations on wall street is somehow going to help small businesswomen here in las vegas or the laid off construction worker here in las vegas get back to work  let me tell you something  we tried that  we tried it for a long time  we tried it for   years  and what happened  it didn't work  we are not going to try something that we know didn't work  that got us into the mess in the first place  we are not going back  we are going forward  we are going forward  we are going forward  nevada  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  we don't believe that the answer to our challenges is to tell folks  you're on your own  if you're sick  hope you don't get sick  if you lose your home  tough luck  you're on your own  if you can't afford college  see if you can borrow money from your parents  we don't believe in that  we believe we're all in this together  we don't believe in an economy that grows from the top down  we believe in an economy that grows from the middle out  from the bottom up  giving everybody a chance  giving everybody a ladder for opportunity  opening up doors for people so that they can work hard and do right by their families and do right by themselves  that's what we believe  that's why i'm running for a second term as president  because we're moving forward together  not on our own  now  i won't pretend some of you heard me at the convention i won't pretend that what i'm offering is the easiest path  i've never said that  in   i didn't say it was going to be easy  and as president clinton reminded us last week  it's going to take more than a few years to solve challenges that have been building up over decades  but we've made progress  every time i meet a child whose parents tell me  you know what  she was sick  but you helped her get insurance  every time i meet somebody who said  you know what  we were able to refinance our home and we've been able to save some money  every time i meet a spouse who says  you know what  you promised to bring my husband or my wife back from iraq  and they're back now every time i see that happen  i'm reminded of the progress that we've made  and we've got a long way to go  but let me tell you something  when we hear folks say that somehow this nation is in decline  they are dead wrong  we've got the best workers in the world  some of them right here in las vegas  we've got the best entrepreneurs in the world  some of them right here in las vegas  we've got the best scientists and the best researchers  the best colleges  the best universities  we've got this incredible diversity that you see in this audience and you see all across the country  people from every background  but all bound together by this creed  this faith that we have in this nation  there is not another country on earth that would not gladly trade places with the united states  so our problems can be solved  and our challenges can be met  and the path we offer may be harder  but it leads to a better place  and i am asking you to choose that future  i'm asking you to rally around the goals i laid out at the convention  to create new manufacturing jobs and new energy sources and improve our education system and bring down our deficit and turn the page on a decade of war  we can do that in the next   years  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  just in case there are a few of you who aren't convinced yet  or i need you to go out and do some convincing of some folks that may not be convinced yet  let me break down exactly what i'm talking about when i say a set of goals for this country  i've got a plan  first of all  to export more products and outsource fewer jobs  after a decade of decline  this country has created over half a million new manufacturing jobs in the last   years  we reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world  now you've got a choice  we can keep giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  or we can start rewarding companies that are investing right here in the united states of america  hiring american workers to create good paying jobs right here  that's what we can do  we can help big factories and small businesses double their exports  we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  we can continue the progress we've made expanding tourism that has a huge impact here in vegas  you can make that happen  we will make it happen if we move forward  but it's up to you  second  i've got a plan to control more of our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that will save you money  it will be good for our economy  good for our environment  we have doubled the amount of renewable energy we generate  including right here in nevada  solar panels all across this state  so not only are we generating energy that we need to grow  but we can also employ thousands of americans  thousands of americans have jobs today building wind turbines and solar panels and long lasting batteries  today  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades  so now you've got a choice  we can reverse that progress  or we can build on it  we can keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal  and our farmers and scientists can harness new biofuels  our construction workers can build homes and factories that waste less energy and retrofit old buildings put them back to work in a way that helps free ourselves from dependence on foreign oil  we can develop a hundred year supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet  if you choose this path  we can cut our oil imports in half by   and we could support more than   jobs in natural gas alone  but you can also choose the alternative  which is to let the oil companies write our energy plans   i audience members i  no   i the president i  but that's moving backwards  and what do we want to do   i audience members i  forward   i the president i  we want to move forward  that's what this campaign's about  third  i've got a plan to give more americans the chance to get the skills they need to compete  education was the gateway of opportunity for me  it was the gateway of opportunity for michelle  it was the gateway of opportunity for many of you  it is the gateway to a middle class life  because of the work we already did  millions of students right here in nevada and all across the country are paying less for college today  we took on a system that was wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders  we cut out the middle man  let's give the money directly to the students  and we helped millions of young people all across this country  so now you've got a choice  we could take my opponent's advice  which results in gutting education   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  now  vote  don't boo  vote  or we can decide that in the united states of america  no child should have their dream deferred because of an overcrowded classroom  last time i was here in vegas  we were hearing about classes that had   kids in them  kids sitting on the floor  old  wornout textbooks  no family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money  no company should have to look for workers in china because they couldn't find the right skilled workers here at home  that's not who we are  that's not how we move forward  so  nevada  i'm asking you to help recruit a hundred thousand math and science teachers in the next   years  improve early childhood education  help give   million workers the chance to study at community colleges to get the skills they need for the jobs that are hiring right now  help us work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth of tuition costs  we can meet that goal  you can choose that future for america  not just for yourself  but for your kids and your grandkids  that's what we mean when we say we've got to move forward  and  nevada  we've got to reduce our deficit  it's important  but we've got to do it in a way that doesn't stick it to the middle class  independent analysis shows my plan for reducing the deficit would cut it by   trillion  i've already worked with republicans in congress to cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending  and i'm willing to do more  i want to reform the tax code so that it's fair and so that it's simple  but i also want to ask the wealthiest households  including my own  to pay a little bit more on incomes over   the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  the same rate we had when we created   million new jobs  went from deficit to surplus  created a whole lot of millionaires to boot  that's the way we have to move forward  now  just to be fair  the other side  they've got a plan too  the problem is  as president clinton pointed out  they don't have any arithmetic in it   i laughter i  the math doesn't add up  because if you think we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy  when you try to pay for   trillion in new tax cuts without raising taxes on middle class families or add   trillion in new military spending that our joint chiefs don't say is going to make us safer without increasing the deficit  well  you've got a you get that error message on your calculator   i laughter i  no amount of extra credit is going to make that math work  i refuse to ask middle class families like yours to pay more so that millionaires and billionaires can pay less  i refuse to ask students to pay more for college so i can pay less  i refuse to kick children out of head start programs or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans who are poor or elderly or disabled just for those just so those with the most can pay less  i don't believe in that  that's not who we are  that's not how we're going to grow our economy  i don't think the answer for hard working folks here in nevada whose homes are underwater is to do nothing  let it bottom out  my administration has already helped more than a million responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages  and i'm running to give more like them the chance to refinance and save   a year and maybe start building up some equity back  that will strengthen the housing market across the board in this state  and by the way  i will never turn medicare into a voucher  because no american should have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  you should retire after a lifetime of labor with some dignity and some respect  you have earned it  we'll reform medicare for the long haul the right way by bringing down costs  not by dumping those costs onto seniors  and we'll keep the promise of social security by taking responsible steps to strengthen it  not by turning it over to wall street like a stack of poker chips  that's the choice that you face this fall  that's what we mean when we talk about moving forward  now  rebuilding our economy is essential  but as we were reminded today  our prosperity at home is linked to our policies abroad  four years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  and we did  i said we'd wind down the war in afghanistan  and we are  a day after   we are reminded that a new tower rises above the new york skyline  but al qaida is on the path to defeat and bin laden is dead  we still face threats in this world  and we've got to remain vigilant  and that's why we will be relentless in our pursuit of those who attacked us yesterday  but that's also why so long as i'm commander in chief we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  and when our troops come home and take off their uniform  we will serve them as well as they've served us  because nobody who has fought for america should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  that is a solemn commitment that we make  and as we're winding down these wars  we can use some of the money that we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and to put more people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and runways and schools  because after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building right here in the united states  right here at home  so let me say this  let me say this  nevada  we can get all this done  i have no doubt in my mind we can get it done  the power to do it  though  is in your hands  i told you at the convention  the election   years ago was not about me  it was about you and the change that you imagined for this country  you are the reason seniors across nevada saved an average of nearly   last year on their medicines because of health care reform  you're the reason thousands of students at unlv have more help paying for college this year  you're the reason two grandparents in reno could refinance their mortgage and keep their piece of the american dream  you're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever known  you're the reason why we ended  don't ask  don't tell  you're the reason why those who fought so bravely for us can come back and hear those two amazing words  welcome home  you are the reason that happened  and that's why we can't turn back now  if you buy into all the cynicism that's being fed to you through these negative ads  well  you know what  change won't happen if you stop fighting for it  if you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference  then you know who's going to fill the void  the lobbyists  the special interests  the folks who are writing these   million checks to run all those negative ads  the people who are trying to make it harder for you to vote  the politicians in washington who want to decide who you can marry  who want to decide for women what their health care choices should be when women are perfectly capable of making those decisions themselves  we cannot let that happen  nevada  we've got the power to make sure it doesn't happen  but i need your help  we've come too far to turn back now  we got more good jobs to create  and we've got too much homegrown energy to generate  we've got more young people to send to college and more good schools to build and more good teachers to hire  we've got more troops to bring home and more veterans to take care of  and we've got more doors of opportunity to open to everybody black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  disabled  not disabled  gay  straight anybody who's willing to work hard and believes in america  we've got to open those doors of opportunity for them  that's why i'm asking for a second term  and if you're willing to work with me and fight for me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls with me  if you vote in november  we will win here in clark county  we will win nevada  we will win this election  we will finish what we started  and you and i together will remind the world why we are the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  golden  thank you   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  you know  this is just too pretty  i don't know how you guys get any work done around here   i laughter i  it is spectacular today  spectacular  and i notice there's kind of like a water slide in there  i wanted to try it out  but i laughter i secret service said no   i laughter i  they would not let me do it  it is great to be back in colorado  can everybody please give lisa a big round of applause for that great introduction  not only does she deserve a great introduction or applause because of the introduction  but also having three kids and one more coming i laughter i that deserves some applause  to all the moms out there  that is some work  and once you get to three  then you've got to play zone defense i laughter i i don't even know what to do with four  i am so grateful to be here  and i'm so grateful that lisa took the time to do this  i've got a couple other friends who are here  first of all  your former senator  an outstanding secretary of the interior  looking after the natural resources of america  ken salazar is in the house  your mayor  marjorie sloan  is here  marjorie  she could not be sweeter  i mean  she gave me such a nice welcome hug and informed me that i am the first president to visit this county since ulysses s  grant  is that correct  now  that's pretty impressive  that's a long time ago  ulysses s  grant   i laughter i  back then  you couldn't even vote  you guys were still a territory   i laughter i  but so i'm glad to put down my marker here   i applause i  absolutely  let me say at the outset that obviously our hearts are heavy this week  we had a tough day a couple of days ago  for four americans were killed in an attack on our diplomatic post in libya  yesterday i had a chance to go over to the state department to talk to friends and colleagues of those who were killed  and these were americans who  like so many others  both in uniform and civilians  who serve in difficult and dangerous places all around the world to advance the interests and the values that we hold dear as americans  and a lot of times  their work goes unheralded  doesn't get a lot of attention  but it is vitally important  we enjoy our security and our liberty because of the sacrifices that they make  and they do an outstanding job every single day  without a lot of fanfare  so what i want all of you to know is that we are going to bring those who killed our fellow americans to justice  i want people around the world to hear me  to all those who would do us harm  no act of terror will go unpunished  it will not dim the light of the values that we proudly present to the rest of the world  no act of violence shakes the resolve of the united states of america  and i've directed my administration to do whatever is necessary to protect all americans who are serving abroad  it's one of my highest priorities as president  and we're also in contact with other governments to underscore that they've got an obligation to cooperate with us to protect our citizens  that's part of their job  now  i know that it's difficult sometimes seeing these disturbing images on television  because our world is filled with serious challenges  this is a tumultuous time that we're in  but we can and we will meet those challenges if we stay true to who we are  and if we would remind ourselves that we're different from other nations  we are different not only because of the incredible landscape that god has given us  we're different because we're a nation that's bound together by a creed  we're not made up of a single tribe or a single religion or a single race  we're a collection of people from all around the world who came here because of a certain set of principles  the idea that all men and women are created equal  that we are all endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights  that's what binds us together  that's what our flag means  but we also believe that these are not just american rights  we believe these are universal aspirations and they're held by people who live in tiny villages in libya  prosperous cities in europe  that's our light to the world  and our task as the most powerful nation on earth is to defend and protect and advance our people  but also to defend and protect and advance those values at home and around the world  that's what our troops do  that's what our diplomats do  that's what our intelligence officers do  that's what our citizens do  that's what we believe  those are the values that we hold to  and here in america  there is no more fundamental part of our democracy than the fact that all of you get a say in the decisions that are made about our country's future  and that's why we're here today  over the past few weeks  colorado  you've been offered two very different paths for our future  you've seen their convention  you've seen ours  and now you chase and now you face one big choice   i audience member i  we're with you   i laughter i   i the president i  ours our vision  our fight is to restore the basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world's ever known  the promise that says hard work will pay off  if you work hard you can make it  that responsibility will be rewarded  that in this country of ours  everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules  from wall street to main street to washington  dc  and that basic bargain is why i ran for president in the first place  because i had watched a decade in which too many jobs were being shipped overseas  in which too many families were struggling with costs that kept on going up  but paychecks that didn't  people having to try to cover basic expenses with credit cards and home equity loans just to pay tuition for college or put gas in the car or food on the table  and then we saw that house of cards that had been built up collapse in the worst recession since the great depression and millions of innocent americans  including folks here in colorado  lost their homes and their jobs  their life savings  and for the last   years  we've been fighting to recover from the body blow that we took  and we've made progress   i applause i  we've made progress  we were losing   jobs a month  we've created jobs now for the past   months  we saved an american auto industry on the brink of going under  manufacturing is starting to come back here in the united states  but we've got so much more work to do  because there's still a lot of folks out there hurting  and here's the thing  i don't think the best answer for today's new challenges are the same old sales pitches  and frankly  that's what you heard mostly in tampa  you heard a long litany of what folks thought was wrong with america  but they didn't tell you much about what they'd do to make it right  they wanted your vote  but they didn't tell you their plan  because basically their plan was one that you had heard before  if we cut more taxes  everybody is going to be okay  especially if we cut taxes at the top  tax cuts in good times  tax cuts in bad times  tax cuts when we're at peace  tax cuts when we're at war  you need to make a restaurant reservation  you don't need the new iphone  here's a tax cut for that   i laughter i  you want to learn a new language  try a tax cut  tax cut to lose a few extra pounds   i laughter i  whatever ails you  now  i've cut taxes for folks who need them  middle class families  small business owners  that's who needs them  the typical family has seen their federal income taxes go down their income tax burden go down by   since i came into office  because it was important to provide folks who need it relief  small businesses  we cut their taxes   times  so i want to give tax relief to folks who need it  but i don't believe another round of tax cuts for millionaires are going to bring good jobs back to our shores  they're not going to bring down our deficits  just like i don't believe that firing teachers or kicking students off of financial aid is going to grow our economy  especially when we've got to compete with the scientists and engineers that are coming out of china  and i've got to say  colorado  after all we've been through  the idea that we would roll back regulations that we finally put in place on wall street to make sure they don't act recklessly again and bring the economy back to its knees  i don't think rolling back regulations are going to help the small businesswoman in jefferson country or laid off construction workers that are trying to get back to work  golden  we have been there  we tried that  it didn't work  we're not going back   i applause i  we are not going back  we don't believe in a top down  trickle down economy that says to everybody  you're on your own  we believe that we're all in this together  we believe that the economy grows from the middle class out  from the bottom up  that's how we move forward  and i won't pretend that the path i'm offering is easy  bill clinton reminded us last week  it's going to take a few more years to deal with all the challenges that we built up over decades  but when i hear some folks i guess  just for political reasons saying how america is in decline  they are wrong  we still have the world's best workers in the world  we've got the best researchers and scientists in the world  we've got the best colleges and universities in the world  we've got the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best democracy in the world  there is not a country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states of america  our problems can be solved  and our challenges can be met  and the path i offer may be harder  but it leads to a better place  i'm asking   i at this point  the president sneezed i   i the president i  i'm getting all choked up   i laughter i  i'm getting all choked up here  i'm asking you to choose that future  i am asking you  colorado  to rally around a set of goals  concrete  achievable goals  to create new manufacturing jobs and new energy sources  to improve education  to bring down our deficit in a balanced  responsible way  to turn a page on a decade of war  that's what we can do in the next   years  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i   i i the president i  now  let me talk about this plan  because you need to know what you're voting for  number one  i've got a plan to export more products and outsource fewer jobs  after a decade of decline  this country has created over half a million new manufacturing jobs in the last   years  we reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world  so now you've got a choice  you can follow the other side's advice and keep giving more tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs right here in america  we can help big factories and small businesses double their exports  we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  we can continue to invest in basic science and research so that we maintain our technological edge and commercialize those advances  that's how we stay on top  that's how we stay number one  you can make that happen  that's what we're fighting for  that's why i want a second term  i've got a plan to control more of our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that saves you money  it helps our national security  and it helps to preserve this incredible  beautiful landscape that we've got  we've doubled the amount of renewable energy that we generate from sources like wind and solar power  thousands of americans here in colorado and all across the country have jobs today building wind turbines and long lasting batteries  solar panels  and today  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than any time in nearly two decades  that's what we've done  so now you've got a choice  we can reverse this progress  like the other side has talked about  or we can build on it  now  unlike my opponent  i'm not going to let the oil companies write our energy plan  i'm not going to get rid of the wind energy tax credit that is helping to spur this incredibly dynamic sector of our economy  we're going to build on this progress  we need to keep investing in wind and solar and make sure our farmers and scientists are harnessing new biofuels  let's put our construction workers back to work building energy efficient homes and factories  let's develop a hundred year supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet  we can cut our oil imports in half by   and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs all across this country  that's the path forward  that's why i'm running for a second term  i've got a plan to give americans a greater chance to gain the skills they need to compete  education was a gateway of opportunity for me  let's face it  a mixed kid from hawaii born to a single mom is not likely to become president of the united states  but in america  it can happen because of education  because somebody gave me opportunity  you know  a little black girl from the south side of chicago  whose mom is a secretary and dad is a blue collar worker  not likely to become first lady of the united states  but it happens because she got a great education  even though her folks didn't have a lot of money  it's the gateway of opportunity for middle class families  for those who are willing to work hard to get into the middle class and stay there  and because of the work we've done over the last   years  millions of students are paying less for college today because we took out billions of dollars that was being wasted using banks and lenders as middlemen  we started giving these loans directly to students  and now millions more are qualified to get help  we set up a tuition tax credit so that middle class families can get a   tuition credit over   years to help their kids go to school  now we've got to build on that progress  and you've got a choice  and the other side  they're proposing to gut education to pay for more tax breaks for folks like me   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  now  vote   i laughter i  vote  i think we've got a better path  we can decide that in the united states of america  no child should have her dream deferred because of an overcrowded classroom or a crumbling school or outdated textbooks  and no family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter just because they don't have the money  no company should have to look for workers in china because they couldn't find the right skills for folks here in the united states  so i'm asking you to help me recruit   new math and science teachers and improve early childhood education and get   million more workers the chance to go to community colleges to get the skills they need for the jobs that are out there right now  and let's help bring down college and university tuition costs over the next several years  we can meet that goal  you can choose that future for america  yes we can   i audience members i  yes we can   i the president i  you remember that  now  we can do all this and we can reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class  so i put forward a plan that will reduce our deficit by   trillion  that's not my opinion  there's independent analysis that's been done  this will reduce the deficit by   trillion  i've worked with republicans in congress already to cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending  and i'm willing to work with them to do more  everybody talks about how partisan everything is  listen  i am happy to work with republicans  i want their cooperation  i if they want me  i'll wash the car  i'll walk the dog for them i laughter i to get a deal done for the american people  i want to reform our tax code so that it's simple and so that it's fair  there are areas where we should be able to agree  but here's the thing i can't do  i can't ask millionaires to do nothing  and then ask everybody else to do a whole lot  so i've asked  under my plan  the wealthiest households will pay a slightly higher rate on their income taxes after the   threshold  so they'd still get a tax cut for the first   that would apply to   percent of americans  but for that dollar after   you pay a little bit more  the same rate that you paid under bill clinton  the same rate that was in force when our economy created nearly   million new jobs  went from deficit to the biggest surplus in history  and we created a lot of millionaires to boot  and by the way  i want you to understand why this is important  if we take that approach where folks like me and governor romney are paying a little bit more  then we can keep taxes low for middle class families    percent of american families make   or less  and so we can keep your tax cuts in place  and we can still invest in our future  and here's the thing  when you've got some tax relief  when the firefighter or the teacher or the construction worker or the receptionist when you guys when the small businessperson because   percent of small businesses make less than  when you have money in your pockets  what do you do   i audience members i  spend it   i laughter i   i the president i  because you have to  right  your car is   years old  and you've got a boiler in the house you got to fix  right  so there are things you do with the money  that means  then  businesses have more customers  that means businesses make more profits and businesses hire more workers  which means  then  the economy gets that much stronger  that's how you grow an economy  not from the top down  from the bottom up  from the middle out  that's how we do it  that's how we've always done it  now  in fairness  the other side does have a plan also  but as president clinton pointed out  it doesn't have arithmetic in it  now  keep in mind  these are folks who say that their biggest priority is reducing the deficit  this is a generational obligation  we've got to do right by our kids  et cetera  so what's their first proposal  they think that we're going to lower our deficit by spending trillions of dollars more on new tax breaks for the wealthy  well  that doesn't add up  when you try to pay for   trillion in new tax cuts  there are only so many places you can go  first of all  you can gut education investments and investments in research and technology  and we can stop rebuilding our infrastructure  but even if you do all that  you haven't come close to   trillion  so eventually  what independent analysis says is that middle class families are going to have to pay for it  or alternatively  the deficit blows up  and if you don't see that math  then you've got to go see your teacher after school  you got to go talk to lisa and get some get a tutorial   i laughter i  and on top of the   trillion tax cut that they're talking about that would give the average person making   million a year a   tax cut  in addition  they want to add   trillion in new military spending without increasing they say they're not going to increase the deficit  well  your calculator is going to go out on you if you try to add all that stuff up  so listen  golden  i refuse to ask middle class families to pay more so that i pay less  i refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children out of head start programs or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans who are poor or elderly or disabled just to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy that we cannot afford  and i will not turn medicare into a voucher just to give tax cuts to the wealthy  no american should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  they should retire with dignity and respect  and we're going to reform and strengthen medicare for the long haul  but we do it by reducing the costs of health care  by making the health care system smarter so that instead of five tests  you get one test  and then it's e mailed everywhere  and we reduce all the paperwork because we're enhancing information technologies in the health care system  and we're doing more preventive care  those are the things that are going to reduce the cost of care  but we don't just shift those costs on to seniors and ask them to pay thousands of dollars more  that's not right   i audience members i  no   i the president i  and we are certainly going to make sure that we keep the promise of social security  we'll take responsible steps to strengthen it  but we're not going to turn it over to wall street  so we're going to rebuild our economy  but our prosperity at home is linked to what we do abroad  and this week's events remind us of that  so   years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  and we did  i said we'd wind down the war in afghanistan  and we are  and while a two new tower rises above the new york skyline  al qaida is on the path to defeat  and usama bin laden is dead  but we see on our televisions that there are still threats to the world in the world  and we've got to remain vigilant  that's why we have to be relentless in pursuing those who attacked us this week  that's also why  so long as i'm commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  and that's why when our troops take off their uniform we will serve them as well as they've  served us  because nobody who has fought for us should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  that is a solemn oath that we have to keep  and we will use the money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and to put more people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges  schools and runways  helping local communities hire firefighters and police officers and first responders  because after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building right here  right here in colorado  right here in the united states of america  let's put americans back to work  we can do all this  and the power to do it is where it has always been  in your hands  i said this at the convention  the election   years ago wasn't about me  it was about you  you were the change  you're the ones who made it happen  you're the reason that there's a teacher and her husband in pueblo who can now buy their first home with the help of new tax credits  you're the reason that a woman outside durango can get the treatment she needs for her breast cancer  now that there are affordable plans to cover preexisting conditions  you're the reason seniors across colorado are saving an average of nearly   every year on prescription drugs because of obamacare  and it's true  i do care  that's why we pushed it  you care  that's why we made it happen  you're the reason that a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home  you're the reason why a selfless soldier won't be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love  we ended  don't ask  don't tell  you're the reason why thousands of families have finally been able to say to their loved ones who served us so bravely   welcome home  you made that happen  and the only way america keeps moving forward is if you don't stop  you can't buy into the cynicism that the other side is selling  you can't let them convince you somehow that change isn't possible  if you give up on the idea that your voice makes a difference  then other people rush in to fill the void  the lobbyists  the special interests  the folks who are writing the   million checks to run all those negative ads  the folks who are trying to make it harder for you to vote  the washington politicians who want to decide for you who you can marry or what kind of health care women should get   i audience members i  no   i the president i  we can't let that happen  colorado  and that's why i need your help  because we've come too far to turn back now  we've got more good jobs to create  we've got more clean  homegrown energy to generate  we've got more good schools to build and more great teachers to hire  we've got more troops to bring home and more veterans to care for  and we've got more doors of opportunity to open to everybody who is willing to work hard and walk through them everybody  black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  young  old  gay  straight  able  not everybody  that's what i'm asking  that you keep going forward  that's why i'm asking for a second term  colorado  and if you're willing to work with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls for me and vote for me in november  we will win colorado  we will win this election  we will finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  cincinnati  thank you  thank you so much  it is good to be back in cincinnati  it is good to be in ohio  it is great to be in this beautiful setting  i it seems like we should have a picnic  who's got the chicken   i laughter i  a little chicken  a little potato salad  baked beans  who said beer   i laughter i  it is beautiful  can everybody please give andrew a great round of applause for that wonderful introduction  you did great  now  let me say  first of all  we could not be prouder of andrew's service to our country as a veteran  we are grateful to him  obviously  we're very proud of the work he's doing and the work he does with his union  but the thing i'm most proud of is the fact that he's got triplets and he's still standing  i had a chance to meet his wonderful wife  and triplets that's serious   i laughter i  you cannot play man to man defense  you've got to go into a zone   i laughter i  so we're very proud of him  and we also have here your outstanding mayor  mark mallory's in the house  and it is great to see all of you   i audience member i  thank you   i the president i  thank you  thank you  now  you may have heard that there's an election going on  and over the past couple of weeks  each side has been able to make its case  they had their thing down in tampa  we had our thing in charlotte  and now  just   days from now  ohio  starting on october   you guys can start voting  and you've got a big choice to make  i honestly believe this is the clearest choice of any time in a generation  it's not just between two candidates or two political parties  but it is a choice between two fundamentally different visions for how we move forward as a country  and our vision  our fight is for that basic bargain that built the greatest middle class on earth and the strongest economy the world has ever known  it's a bargain that says  if you work hard  that hard work will pay off  that responsibility will be rewarded  that everybody should get a fair shot  everybody should do their fair share  everybody should play by the same rules  from main street to wall street to washington  dc  and   years ago  i ran for president because i saw that basic bargain eroding  too many jobs getting shipped overseas  too many families who were struggling with the costs of everything from groceries to gas to college to health care  racking up more and more debt just to keep up with expenses because paychecks weren't going up the way costs were  and then because of that debt  it made things that much harder  and when that house of cards collapsed in the worst recession since the great depression  we saw millions of americans lose their jobs  homes  life savings  and we're still fighting to recover from that tragedy  now  the other side  they're more than happy to talk about what they think is wrong with america  they won't tell you how it started  but they're happy to talk about what's wrong  they don't do much to tell you what they're going to do to make it right  they want your vote  but they don't want to tell you their plan  and the reason is  is because the plan they've got is the same one that they've been offering for decades  tax cuts  tax cuts  gut a few regulations  and then let's try some more tax cuts  tax cuts in good times  tax cuts in bad times  tax cuts when we're at peace  and tax cuts when we're at war  you want to make a restaurant reservation or book a flight  you don't need the new iphone try a tax cut   i laughter i  want to drop a few extra pounds  try a tax cut   i laughter i  they've got one answer for everything  now  i've cut taxes too for folks who need it  middle class families  you're paying about   less in federal taxes since i've been president  i cut taxes for the middle class like i promised  small businesses  i've cut taxes   separate times  but i don't think another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs back to ohio or pay down our deficit  i sure don't believe firing teachers or kicking students off of financial aid will help grow our economy or compete with countries like china that are producing engineers and scientists  after all that we've been through  does anybody actually believe that rolling back regulations on wall street are somehow going to help the small businesswoman in cincinnati expand or the construction worker who's been laid off  let me tell you  we have been there  we have tried that  we are not going back   i applause i  we're not going back  we're not going back to trickle down  we're not going back to top down  you're on your own economics  we're not going to tell folks that you're on your own  because we believe we're all in this together  we don't think the economy grows from the top down  we think it grows from the middle out  from a strong middle class  from strong working families  when people are doing well in the middle  then everybody does well  what happens when you've got a little more money in your pocket   i audience members i  you spend it   i the president i  you spend it  and that means businesses have more customers  that means they make more profits  and then they hire more workers  and we get a virtuous cycle  going up  going forward  we are not going backwards  we are moving forward  that's what this election's about  and i want you to know  cincinnati  i have never promised that the path we're on is going to be quick or easy  as bill clinton reminded us at the convention  it's going to take more than a few years to solve challenges that have built up over decades  but let me tell you something  i know we will get there  when i hear some of these folks in the other party talk about a nation in decline  they are dead wrong  we've still got the best workers in the world  we've got the best entrepreneurs and the best businesses in the world  we've got the best scientists and researchers in the world  we got the best colleges and universities in the world  there's not a country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states of america  our problems can be solved  and our challenges can be met  the path we offer may be harder  but it leads to a better place  and i'm asking you to choose that future  i'm asking you to rally around a set of goals to create new manufacturing jobs here in ohio  to build on what we've already done to create a new energy strategy for america  building on what we've already done to improve education and bring down our deficit  turn the page on a decade of war  that's what we can do in the next   years  cincinnati  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  i want everybody to be clear  the goals we've set are concrete  and they are achievable  the first part of the plan is to export more products and outsource fewer jobs  after a decade of decline  this country has now created over half a million new manufacturing jobs in the last   years  a whole lot of them here in ohio  when some of these other folks said we should let detroit go bankrupt  when they said we should walk away from an industry that supports one in eight jobs in ohio  i said  we're not going to go that way  i bet on american workers  and   years later  the american auto industry has come roaring back with nearly   jobs  so now you've got a choice  we can give more tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas   i audience members i  no   i the president i or we can start rewarding corporations and companies that are opening new plants and training new workers and creating new jobs right here in ohio  right here in the united states of america  right here  now  i understand my opponent's been running around ohio claiming   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  vote  but he's been running around ohio claiming he's going to roll up his sleeves and he's going to take the fight to china   i laughter i  now  here's the thing  his experience has been owning companies that were called  pioneers  in the business of outsourcing jobs to countries like china  he made money investing in companies that uprooted from here and went to china  pioneers  now  ohio  you can't stand up to china when all you've done is send them our jobs  you can talk a good game  but i like to walk the walk  not just talk the talk  and my experience has been waking up every single day and doing everything i can to make sure american workers get a fair shot in the global economy  when other countries don't play by the rules  we've done something about it  we've brought more trade cases against china in one term than the previous administration did in two  and every case we've brought that's been decided  we won  when governor romney said that stopping unfair surges in chinese tires would be bad for america  bad for our workers  we ignored his advice  and we got over a thousand americans back to work creating tires right here in the united states of america  earlier this year  i set up a new task force to aggressively go after unfair trade practices that harm our workers  and it's already delivering  two months ago  we moved to hold china accountable for unfair trade practices that harm american automakers  today my administration's launching a new action against china  this one against illegal subsidies that encourage companies to ship auto parts manufacturing jobs overseas  these are subsidies that directly harm working men and women on the assembly lines in ohio and michigan and across the midwest  your senator  sherrod brown  has fought as hard as anybody to stop this  and we are going to stop it  it is not right  it is against the rules  and we will not let it stand  american workers build better products than anybody   made in america  means something  like andrew said  when the playing field is level  america will always win  but what we need is folks who actually walk the walk  not just talk the talk  we don't need folks who during election time suddenly are worrying about trade practices  but before the election are taking advantage of unfair trading practices  and  ohio  if you stand with me  if you choose the path we're talking about  we're going to help big factories and small businesses double their exports  and we'll sell more goods around the world stamped with  made in america  and we'll create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  we can do that  but i need your help to move forward  now  that's not all we're going to have to do to rebuild our economy  we've got to train our workers to fill good jobs  that's why the second part of my plan is to give more americans the chance to earn the skills that they need to compete  now  education was the gateway of opportunity for me  it was the gateway of opportunity for michelle  it was the gateway of opportunity for a lot of you  andrew right now he's studying to get his degree with some help from pell grants that we expanded  because he understands that even though he's doing well now  we've constantly got to build up our skills  it's the gateway to a middle class life  today  millions of students are paying less for college because we finally took on a system that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars using banks and lenders as middlemen  we said let's give the money directly to students  and we've been able to help millions of more young people get an education  so now you've got a choice  the other side  you look at their budget  they're proposing to gut education just to pay for more tax breaks for the wealthy  that's one path   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i'm offering a different path  we can decide that in the united states of america  no child should have her dreams deferred because of an overcrowded classroom or a crumbling school  no family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they can't afford it  no company should have to look for workers in china because they couldn't find any with the right skills here in the united states of america  so  cincinnati  i'm asking you to help me recruit a hundred thousand new math and science teachers in the next   years and improve early childhood education  let's help give   million workers the chance to learn the skills they need at community colleges that will lead directly to a job  let's work with colleges and universities to keep tuition down  to cut in half the tuition costs over the next   years  we can meet those goals together  that's the future we can choose  third thing  i've got a plan to control more of our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel efficiency standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will get twice will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that will save you money  that helps our national security  and it helps our environment  we've doubled the amount of renewable energy we generate from wind and solar  and thousands of americans  including here in ohio  have jobs today building wind turbines and long lasting batteries  we are less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last   years  now  you've got a choice between a plan that reverses this progress or one that builds on it  because as long as i'm president  i'm not going to let oil companies write this country's energy plan  and i'm not going to let them keep on collecting   billion in taxpayer funded corporate welfare  we've got a better path  we'll keep on investing in wind and solar and clean coal technology  we'll invest to help farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and our trucks  let's put some construction workers back to work rebuilding our homes and our factories so they waste less energy  and we've got to develop a nearly hundred year supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet  we can do it in a way that's safe  and if you choose this path  we can cut our oil imports in half by   and we can support about   new jobs in natural gas alone  that's a plan for the future  it's not a plan looking backwards  number four  we're going to reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class  i put forward a plan that will reduce our deficit by   trillion  you don't have to take my word for it  independent analysis they've looked at it   i audience member i  we believe you  it's okay   i the president i  i appreciate that  but just in case you're skeptical  we've actually got real numbers behind it  i've worked with republicans in congress to already cut   trillion in spending  and we're willing to do more  i don't want a government that's wasting money  it's got to be lean  it's got to be mean  it's got to make sure that it's focused on the people that are working hard  but need a ladder up  it's got to be focused on doing the things that help us grow  and there are programs that don't work  and we got to admit that  i want to reform the tax code so it's simple and it's fair  i've actually done my own taxes   i laughter i  i don't know about some of these other folks  but i've done them  you know  so it's so i know we can make a it's more simple and more fair  but i also think we've got to ask the wealthiest households to pay a little bit more on incomes over   the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  the same rate we had when the economy created nearly   million new jobs  the biggest surplus in history  and we helped a lot of millionaires to boot  remember why  because if we're helping middle class families  what happens  you're going to spend the money  middle out  not top down  now  in fairness  my opponent has a plan too when it comes to taxes  but as president clinton pointed out  there's one thing missing from it  arithmetic  arithmetic  they talk about they say the most important thing we have to do is reduce the deficit  right  that's what they say  then the first thing they do is to spend trillions dollars more on tax breaks for the wealthy not just the bush tax cuts  on top of the bush tax cuts  trillion more  so they must have skipped math class when they were in school  it because that math does not add up   i laughter i  and whenever you ask them to explain the plan  they won't  they won't say how they'd pay for   trillion in new tax cuts  understand how much   trillion is  i know sometimes this money billions  trillions it gets all mixed up   i laughter i  five trillion dollars over   years means   billion every year  now    billion is about the amount of our entire defense budget  everything we spend on our military  everything troops  planes  carriers it's about   billion  so they're saying they're going to give a tax cut equivalent to our entire defense budget every single year   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  but they can't tell you how they're going to pay for it  and the truth is they can't pay for it without raising taxes on middle class families  but then they on top of that  they want to spend another   trillion in new military spending  they say  without adding to the deficit  but they don't tell you how they're going to do that  the only thing they can do is to keep trying to bluff their way through until november and hope that you won't call them on it  but understand  cincinnati  look  i want to work with them to reduce the deficit  i've said if the republicans need more love  if they want me to walk the dog or i laughter i wash their car  i'm happy to do it   i laughter i  and i genuinely believe that most americans democrats or republicans they just want us to solve problems  so i'm ready and willing to work  but i refuse to ask middle class families to pay over   more so that millionaires and billionaires can pay less  i refuse to cut clean energy investments and put   clean energy jobs here in ohio at risk just to give me a tax cut or romney a tax cut  i refuse to ask more than   ohio students to pay more for college or kick children out of head start programs or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans who are poor or elderly or disabled  just to pay for a tax cut for wealthy folks who don't need it  and i will never turn medicare into a voucher  folks who have worked hard their whole lives  they shouldn't be spending their golden years at the mercy of an insurance company  they should retire with dignity and respect  and yes  we've got to reform and strengthen medicare for the long haul  but we're going to do it by reducing the cost of health care  not by dumping the costs onto seniors  same thing with social security  we'll keep the promise of social security by taking responsible steps to strengthen it  but we're not going to turn it over to wall street   i audience members i  no   i the president i  now  rebuilding our economy is essential  but our prosperity at home is also linked to our policies abroad  and current events the events of the past week obviously remind us of that  now    years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  and we did  i said it's time for us to start winding down the war in afghanistan  and we are  we've got a new tower rising above the new york skyline  even as al qaida is on the path to defeat and usama bin laden is dead  but what happened this past week underscores that we still face threats in the world  now  we can't just pull back  we've got to stay engaged and involved for our security  but we've also got to remain vigilant  that's why  so long as i'm commander in chief  we will always have the strongest military the world has ever known  we'll do what's required to keep our personnel safe around the world  and when our troops come home  when they take off their uniform  we will serve them as well as they've served us  because in america  no one should no one who fought for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  but  again  here you've got a choice too  because my opponent said it was  tragic  for me to end the war in iraq  he still won't tell us how he's going to end the war in afghanistan  and while he wants to spend more money on military programs that our joint chiefs say won't keep us safer  i'll use that money that we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and to put more people back to work rebuilding some of these bridges around cincinnati  rebuilding schools and runways  after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building here at home  so  cincinnati  that's the choice you face  that's what this election comes down to    days and you'll start making that choice  and over and over again  we've been told by our opponents that their way is the only way  that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if a company is polluting the air your children breathe  well  that's the price of progress  if you can't afford to start a business or go to college  borrow money from your parents   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  don't boo  vote   i audience members i  vote  vote  vote   i the president i  you know what  that's not who we are  that's not what this country is about  as americans  we insist on personal responsibility  we insist on individual initiative  we're not going to help folks who can't help who aren't even trying to help themselves  nobody is entitled to success  you've got to earn it  we believe in somebody who's out there starting a business the strivers  the dreamers  the risk takers they drive our economy  that's what we believe in  the free enterprise system  the greatest engine of growth and prosperity the world has ever known  but we also believe that in this country  as citizens  we accept certain obligations to each other and to future generations  as citizens  we understand america is not just what can be done for us  it's about what can be done by us  together  as one nation  as one people  and all of you understand that  the election   years ago wasn't about me  it was about all of you  it was about us  you're the reason that there's a cancer survivor in medina that can afford a health care plan that covers preexisting conditions  you made that happen  you're the reason a factory worker in toledo who lost his job is back on the line building some of the best cars in the world  you did that  you're the reason that young man in columbus whose mother worked three jobs to raise him can finally afford to go to college  that's because of you  you're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home  you're the reason we ended  don't ask  don't tell  you're the reason that thousands of families around this country are able to say to the ones who bravely served   welcome home  you made that happen  so  cincinnati  you can't turn back now  if you buy into the cynicism that says change is impossible  then change doesn't happen  if you give up on the idea that your voice matters  then somebody else fills the void  the folks who are writing the   million checks trying to buy this election  the folks who are trying to make it harder for you to vote  washington politicians who want to make the decisions for you about who you can marry  want to tell women they can't make their own health care decisions  that's who will fill the void  only you can make sure that doesn't happen  only you can keep this country moving forward  it depends on you  it depends on you  you've got to register to vote before october   it depends on you to start showing up and start voting october   if you don't know how to do it  then right here lift up that sign  young lady gotta vote  go to gottavote com  find out how and where to vote  and the good thing about voting early is then you can spend the rest of your time getting other folks to vote  because we've come too far to turn back now  we've got too many good jobs to create  we've got too much homegrown energy to generate  we've got good schools to build  and we've got great teachers to hire  we've got more troops to bring home  and we've got more veterans to care for  we've got more doors of opportunity to open for everybody who's willing to work hard  everybody who's willing to walk through those doors  we've got to make sure this is a country where in america  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your last name is  you can make it if you try  that's why i'm asking for a second term  ohio  and if you're willing to stand with me and knock on some doors for me and make some phone calls for me and vote for me  we will win ohio  we will win this election  we will finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  columbus  thank you  well  thank you  it is great to be back in columbus  this is   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  thank you so much  well  see  this is why i like to come to columbus  because everybody is so nice here in ohio  it is wonderful to be here  can everybody please give jeff a big round of applause for that great introduction  now  all of you are good friends  but i've got some people i definitely got to call out  first of all  your outstanding mayor  michael coleman  is in the house  your former governor  ted strickland  is in the house  your next congresswoman  joyce beatty is here  and all of you are here  now  i know some of you may have just wandered up because you thought you were going to take a nice stroll through the park say  what's going on there  seems like there's a big crowd  but it turns out there's an election going on right now  it's true   i laughter i  and over the past couple of weeks  you've had a chance to see both sides make their case  they were down in tampa  we were in charlotte   i audience member i  in charlotte   i the president i  you saw   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  okay  now  in just   days  ohio  starting on october   you will have one big choice to make  i think  the clearest choice of any time in a generation  and this is not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  this is a choice between two different visions for how we move the country forward  what we're fighting for our vision is to restore the basic bargain that built this country  that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known  and that bargain can be stated very simply  it says  if you work hard  you can make it  if you meet your responsibilities  then you can get ahead  that everyone in this country no matter what you look like or where you come from  what your last name is everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules from main street to wall street  to washington  dc  now  i ran for president because i saw this basic bargain eroding  here in ohio  too many jobs were being shipped overseas  too many families struggling to keep up with rising costs  but paychecks that weren't going up  people having to take on more debt just to pay tuition for their kid's college or put gas in the car  and then  eventually  this entire house of cards collapsed    years ago this month  in the worst financial crisis since the great depression  and millions of americans lost their jobs  homes  savings  and we've been fighting ever since to recover from the policies that got us into this hole  now  the other side seems to forget how all this got started  they have a convenient case of amnesia  and so  at their convention  they were happy to talk about all the things they think are wrong with america  but they didn't have much to say about how they'd make it right  they want your vote  but they don't want you to know their plan because the plan they're offering is the same old  same old  that we've been hearing from them for   years  they want tax cuts  tax cuts  we roll back some regulations and then give you more tax cuts  tax cuts when times are bad  tax cuts when times are good  tax cuts during peacetime and then some tax cuts during wartime  you want to make a restaurant reservation or book a flight  you don't need the new iphone  you just use a tax cut   i laughter i  now  listen  i've cut taxes  just like i promised  for folks who need it  for middle class families  for small businesses  the average family has seen their federal income tax their federal taxes go down by   so if any of you are talking to your republican friends or relatives  and they say  well  he's a big tax guy  you tell them  no  your taxes are lower than they were when i came into office  small businesses  we've cut taxes   times  but i do not believe that another round of tax cuts for millionaires are going to bring good jobs back to ohio  i don't think giving me a tax break or giving mr  romney a tax break will help pay down our deficit  i don't believe that firing teachers or kicking students off of financial aid is somehow going to grow our economy  that's not going to help us compete against all the scientists and engineers coming out of china  and after all we've been through  does anybody really think that somehow rolling back regulations on wall street that we put in place to make sure we don't have another taxpayer funded bailout that somehow that's going to be good for the small businesswoman here in columbus or help the construction worker get back on the job  ohio  we have tried what they're selling  we tried it  we've been there  it didn't work  we don't like it  we're not going back   i applause i  we're not going back  we're not going back   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  see  we don't believe that the answer to our challenges is just to tell folks you're on your own  we think we're all in this together  you look at this crowd  people of every walk of life  that's what america is  and we don't believe this economy grows from the top down  we think it grows from the middle out  from the bottom up  think about it  when i cut taxes on middle class families  why did i do that  because when you guys have a little more money in your pocket  what happens   i audience members i  we spend it   i the president i  you spend it because you need to  because you've got expenses  so then you decide  you buy a new computer for your kid going off to college or you finally trade in that old  beat up car you got  and so businesses then  they have more profits  they've got more customers  that means they're hiring more workers  that means those folks then have more money to spend  the whole economy does better  if you give a tax break to a billionaire  you can only buy so many yachts   i laughter i  right  i mean  at a certain point  you stop  so it doesn't do the same thing for the economy  so not only is it the right thing to do  it's the smart thing to do for us to grow  to make sure that middle class families are strong and people who are poor and willing to work hard to get into the middle class  that they've got a chance  that's our vision  that's why we're not going backward  that's why we're going forward  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  hold on a second  i want you to know  though  because some of you may not have been paying attention at the convention because you were still thinking about michelle and how good she was  or maybe you were still talking about president clinton and how he broke it down  but i want everybody to be clear  the path i'm offering isn't quick or easy  it's going to take more than a few years to deal with all the challenges that we face  but let me tell you something  when i hear the other side talking about how the nation is in decline  i tell them  you must not be getting out much i laughter i because this is america and we've still got the best workers in the world and the best entrepreneurs in the world and the best scientists and researchers in the world and the best colleges and universities in the world  and there is not a country on earth that wouldn't trade places with us right now  so i'm confident our problems can be solved  our challenges will be met  the path i offer is harder  but it leads to a better place because it allows everybody to prosper  anybody who is willing to work hard can get ahead  i'm asking you to choose that future  and i'm asking you to rally around a specific set of goals  to create new manufacturing jobs and to strengthen our energy sector and improve education and bring down our deficit and turn the page on a decade of war  that's what i intend to accomplish in the next   years  that's why i'm running for a second term  i need those   years to get all that done  so let me just break down this plan very clearly  part one  we're going to export more products  and we're going to outsource fewer jobs  after a decade where manufacturing had been declining  this country has now created over the last   years over half a million new manufacturing jobs  a whole lot of them right here in ohio  when there were some who said  just let detroit go bankrupt  when there were folks who were willing to walk away from all the jobs that are supported here in ohio by the auto industry  i bet on american workers  and   years later  the american auto industry has brought back nearly   new jobs  it's come roaring back  so you've got a choice  we can do what mr  romney suggests and keep giving tax breaks   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote   i applause i  don't boo  vote  we can keep giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  or we can start rewarding companies that are opening new plants and training new workers and creating new jobs right here in the united states of america  and when it comes to trade  i understand my opponent has been running around ohio claiming he's going to take the fight to china   i laughter i  now  this is a guy whose experience has been owning companies that were called  pioneers  of outsourcing jobs to countries like china made money investing in companies shipping jobs to china  ohio  you can't stand up to china if all you've done is send them our jobs   i laughter i  you can talk a good game   weeks before an election  but you can't just talk the talk  you've got to walk the walk  i wake up every single day thinking about america's workers and making sure they've got a fair shot in this economy  when other countries don't play by the rules  we walk the walk  we've brought more trade cases against china in one term than the previous administration did in two  when governor romney was complaining that because we stopped an unfair surge in chinese tires here into the united states  he said  well no  that's protectionist  we did it anyway  and we got over   american jobs back  right here in the united states  earlier this year  i set up a new task force to go after every unfair trade practices that harm our workers  and it's already delivering  two months ago  we moved to hold china accountable for unfair trade practices that harm american automakers  today my administration is launching a new action against china  this one against illegal subsidies that encourage companies to ship auto parts manufacturing jobs overseas  which directly hurts men and women on the assembly lines in ohio and michigan and throughout the midwest  your senator  by the way  sherrod brown  has fought as hard as anybody on this  so where folks are breaking the rules  we go after them  we're not going to let it stand  it's not right  it's against the rules  we're not going to let it stand  american workers build better products than anybody   made in america  means something  and when the playing field is level  we always win  so that's a choice you've got in this election  though because my opponent  not only does he want to keep tax incentives that would send jobs overseas  he wants to expand them  now   i audience member i  i love you   i the president i  i love you back  but i'm not finished  now  if you choose the path i'm offering  then we can help big factories and small businesses double their exports  we can sell more goods around the world made right here  we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  we've shown we can do it  but that's not all it's going to take to rebuild our economy  we've got to make sure our workers are trained to fill those good jobs  and that's why the second part of my plan is to give every american the chance to earn the skills they need to compete  education was the gateway of opportunity for me  it was what gave michelle a chance  it's what gave so many of you a chance  it's the path to a middle class life  and when i say  by the way  a higher education  it doesn't mean   years  it may be you go to a community college for   or a training program  but the point is  it's not enough right now just to get that   years in high school because the economy is more complicated now and the skills that are needed are more advanced  now  the good news is we've already done work on this  so millions of students are already paying less for college because of what we did  we took on a system that was wasting billions of taxpayer dollars using banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program  and we said why do we need the middlemen  let's cut them out  let's give the money directly to students  and as a consequence  we've been able to help young people all across this country  but once again  we've got a choice in this election  because governor romney wants to roll back what we did  then he's got a budget that would gut education to pay for more tax breaks for the wealthy  that's one path  but i'm offering a different path  i believe that in the united states of america  no child should ever have her dreams deferred because of an overcrowded classroom or outdated textbooks  no family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money  no company should have to look for workers in china because they couldn't find workers with the right skills here at home  so  ohio  what i'm offering  and i need your help  i need you to help me recruit   new math and science teachers and improve early childhood education and give   million workers the chance to learn the skills they need at community colleges and help us work with colleges and universities to keep tuition down so that our young people have a chance at a future without taking on tens of thousands of dollars' worth of debt  we can meet that goal  but i need your help   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  third thing  we've got to control our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  and by the way  detroit is making those cars  and toledo is making those cars  all across the midwest  we're seeing american cars now  we're going to meet those standards  we're going to beat those standards  we've doubled the amount of renewable energy we're generating from sources like wind and solar  that's creating thousands of jobs building wind turbines and long lasting batteries right here in ohio  america is less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last two decades  so we've already made progress  but we can make more  and the question is  are we going to go back to a plan that reverses the progress  or do we build on our progress  see  i want you guys to know  i'm not going to let oil companies write this country's energy plan  i'm not going to let them keep collecting   billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers  the path we're offering is to keep investing in wind and solar  clean coal technology  and make sure farmers and scientists are harnessing new biofuels to power our cars and our trucks  let's put construction workers back to work rehabbing and retrofitting buildings and factories so they waste less energy  let's develop a hundred year supply of natural gas that's beneath our feet  and if we do all this  we can cut our oil import in half by   and support   new jobs in natural gas alone  that's the path forward  fourth thing  let's reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class  see  we really do have to reduce our deficit  but the way i do it  we're cutting our deficit by   trillion  making sure everybody does it the right way  i've worked with republicans in congress  we've cut a trillion dollars' worth in spending  not every program works  there is some waste in government we can take and make sure that we're bringing down our deficit  i want to reform our tax code so that it's simple and it's fair  but i also want to make sure we're asking the wealthiest households to pay a slightly higher tax on incomes over   the same rate that we had when bill clinton was president  when our economy was creating nearly   million new jobs  when we had the biggest surplus in history  and we had a whole bunch of millionaires to boot  and why is it that we created a lot millionaires  because when middle class families are doing well  what happens  everybody does well  everybody does well  when you give ladders of opportunity for poor folks to get into the middle class  what happens  everybody does well  they've got more money to spend  they buy products  we hire more workers  everybody does better  now  i've got to say  my opponent does have his own plan  but it's missing one thing  arithmetic   i laughter i  it doesn't add up  i mean  think about it  he says that the most important thing we have is to reduce our deficit  and i really want i hope some republicans are watching right now and some independents  because i just want everybody to break down the math  you say you want to reduce the deficit  so what's your first plan  you're going to spend   trillion in tax cuts  trillion  sometimes people lose sight of how much this means  so   trillion over   years  that's   billion a year  right  i think my math is right  now    billion  that's how much we spend on the defense department  our entire military  so he's going to give a tax cut  mostly going to wealthy folks like me and mr  romney  a   tax break for people making   million a year or more  and it's going to cost us   trillion on top of the bush tax cuts  now  they must have skipped math class when they were i laughter i every time they're asked to explain this plan  they won't explain it because they can't  they cannot explain how they'd pay for a   trillion tax cut without slashing education funding  slashing investments in research  slashing investments in helping our seniors and people who are vulnerable  and in raising taxes on middle class families  but it doesn't stop there  they then want to add another   trillion in military spending  and they say they won't add to the deficit  but keep in mind  this is stuff the joint chiefs of staff say is not required to keep us safe  so that's   trillion altogether  on top of the bush tax cuts  trillions of dollars  and they're going to ask you to pay for it to give me a tax break  i'm telling you  you cannot make it work  you can't cross the  t s and dot the  i s on this plan  and columbus is a town where you've got to dot the  i  you can't get away with that  so when independent folks have tried to explain it  they've gone through it  and they've kind of gotten their calculators out  they've tallied these ups  and one independent report shows that governor romney's tax plan would provide an additional   tax cut for multimillionaires  but to pay for it    percent of taxpayers would actually foot the bill  you pay more  i mean  imagine a sellout crowd for a buckeye football game at the  horseshoe  under my opponent's tax plan    fans at the game would get an average tax cut of   and about   fans would have to pay for it  and by the way  the ones who would get the tax break are the guys in the box seats   i laughter i  i am not going to ask middle class families with kids to pay over   more so that millionaires and billionaires get to pay less  i'm not going to ask   ohio students to pay more for college or kick children off of head start or eliminate health insurance for the poor or the elderly or the disabled to pay for a tax cut for folks who don't need it  and by the way  i'm not going to turn medicare into a voucher  if you worked hard all your life  you should not spend your golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  you should retire with the dignity that you have earned  so we'll reform medicare  but we'll do it the right way  reducing the cost of health care  not by asking seniors to foot the bill  same thing with social security  well  we'll take responsible steps to strengthen social security  but we're not going to turn it over to wall street  now  one last thing  rebuilding our economy is essential  but obviously  our prosperity at home is linked to our policies abroad  current events remind us of that  obviously  we are heartbroken seeing what happened last week  four years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  and we did  i said we'd wind down the war in afghanistan  and we are  and as a new tower rises above the new york skyline  al qaida is on the path to defeat  and bin laden is dead  but for all the challenges  the events of the past week underscore we've still got threats in the world  so we've got to remain vigilant  we're going to do everything we need to do to make sure our diplomats are safe  we're going to keep providing our troops with the equipment and the strategy that they need  but what we're also going to do is make sure that as long as i'm commander in chief  we've got the strongest military the world has ever known  and when our troops take off their uniforms  we're going to serve them as well as they've served us because nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job when they come home  now  my opponent  he's got a different point of view  he said it was  tragic  to end the war in iraq  and he won't tell us how he'd end the war in afghanistan  he wants to spend more money on programs that our joint chiefs don't even want  well  you know what  i want to spend that money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and to put people back to work here in ohio  rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways  after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building here at home  that's why i'm running for a second term  now  this is the choice that we now face  this is what the election comes down to  the other side  they've told us  over and over again  how bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations that's the only way to go  their way is the only way  they say that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if some company releases pollution that your kids are breathing  they say it's just the price of progress  if you can't afford to go to college  borrow money from your parents  but you know  that's not who we are  that's not what this country is about  we insist on personal responsibility  and we insist on individual initiative  we can't help somebody who doesn't want to help themselves  nobody here is entitled to success  everybody has got to earn it  we honor folks who start a business and the strivers and the dreamers  the risk takers who help make our free enterprise system work  and we believe the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world has ever known  but we also believe that in this country  as citizens  we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations  as citizens  we understand it's not about what can be done for us  but what can be done by us  together  as one nation and as one people  and that's what this election was about   years ago  it wasn't about me  it was about you  you're the reason there's a cancer survivor in medina that can afford a health care plan that covers preexisting conditions  you're the reason there's a factory worker in toledo who lost his job  but now is back on the line building some of the world's best cars  you're the reason a young man right here in columbus  whose mother worked three jobs to raise him  can now afford to go to college got to the ohio state university  that's because of you  you're the reason some young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag is not suddenly going to be snatched up and deported to a country that they don't even know  you're the reason why some outstanding soldier won't be kicked out of the military just because of who they love  you're the reason why thousands of families across the country are seeing folks who served us so bravely  give them a hug and be able to say to them   welcome home  that happened because of you  so that's why these next   weeks are so important  you can't buy into the cynicism the other side is selling  you can't believe what they say about how change isn't possible  if you give up on the idea your voice makes a difference  you know what happens  the other side will start filling it  filling the void with lobbyists and special interests and the folks who are writing the   million checks trying to buy this election  the folks who are trying to make it tougher for you to vote  the washington politicians who want to tell you who you can marry or tell women what they need to do in terms of their own health care choices  so i want to tell you  i've got a lot of fight in me right now  i am fired up  and i'm ready to go  but i need you  only you can keep this country moving forward  if you're not registered  you better register before october   you can start showing up and voting on october   that's   days away  i see some young people here  young people  you got to use early vote because you might not wake up in time on election day   i laughter i  i can't have you missing class  if you don't know how to vote go to gottavote com  that's g o t t a vote  find out how and where  vote early  and if you vote early  then you can get the rest of the time getting other folks to vote  ohio  we've come too far to turn back now  we've got more good jobs to create  we've got more clean energy to generate  we've got more young people to send to college  we've got more good schools to build  we've got more teachers to hire  we've got more troops to bring home  we've got more veterans to care for  we've got more doors of opportunity we've got to open up for everybody who's willing to work for it  that's why running for a second term  and if you're willing to stand with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls with me and grab your friends and neighbors and take them to the polls for me  we will win franklin county again  we will win this election  we will finish what we started and remind the world just why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  virginia  well  it is great to be here in pfitzner stadium  home of the potomac nationals  i

little breeze going  it feels good  now   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  i do  now  unless your cable has been broken for a while  you may be aware there's an election going on   i laughter i  i was told a story by my campaign manager  he was meeting with some folks  and there was a young couple there with a young son  maybe   or   years old  and the parents were really proud that he knew who i was  and they explained to my campaign manager  they said  listen  he loves barack obama  and they turned to the little boy and they said  what does barack obama do  and the little boy says  barack obama approves this message   i laughter i  so you know it's election season  that's what i do  i approve this message   i laughter i  and that's because in the coming weeks  you've got a very big choice to make  this is not a choice between two candidates or two parties  this is a choice between two different paths for america  two fundamentally different visions of our future  my opponents are big believers in top down economics   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  mr  romney thinks that if we just spend another   trillion dollars on tax cuts that favor the wealthiest   percent of americans  all our problems are going to be solved  jobs and prosperity will rain down from the sky  deficits will magically disappear  we will all live happily ever after  the end  there's only one problem  we tried that scheme during the last decade  it didn't work  top down economics don't work  this country doesn't succeed when only the rich are getting richer  we succeed when folks at the top are doing well  but also when the middle class is doing well and folks who are fighting to get into the middle are doing well  when more people have a chance to get ahead and live up to their god given potential  i don't believe we can get very far with leaders who write off half the nation as a bunch of victims  who think that they're not interested in taking responsibility for their own lives  i don't see a lot of victims in this crowd today  i see hard working virginians  some of you may be students trying to work your way through college  some of you may be single moms like my mom  putting in overtime to see if you can provide a better life for your kids  some of you may be senior citizens who have been saving your whole life for your retirement  some of you may be veterans who have served this country bravely  soldiers who defend our freedom today  nobody believes that anyone's entitled to success in this country  we don't believe that government should be helping people who refuse to help themselves  but we do believe in something called opportunity  we believe in a country where hard work pays off  where responsibility is rewarded  where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules  that's the country we believe in  that's what i believe in  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  now  i've told you before  and i will tell you again  the path i'm offering is not necessarily going to be quick or easy  because the truth is it's going to take more than a few years to solve challenges that built up over decades  but i can tell you this  virginia  this is america  our problems can be solved  and our challenges can be met  we've got the best workers in the world  we've got the best businesspeople and entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best scientists and researchers in the world  we've got the best colleges and universities in the world  there's not a country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states of america  so the path i'm offering may be harder  but it leads to a better place  i'm offering a practical  five point plan to create jobs and grow the middle class and rebuild the economy on a stronger foundation  so let me break it down in case you guys missed the convention just in case  or just in case you only saw michelle   i laughter i  number one  i want to export more products and outsource fewer jobs  when my opponent said we should  let detroit go bankrupt  we came together to reinvent a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world  in the last   years  we've created more than half a million new manufacturing jobs in this country  so now you have a choice  we can build on that progress  or we can do what the other folks want to do and give more tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas   i audience members i  no   i the president i  we can continue to see outsourcing  or we can do some insourcing and reward companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs right here in the united states of america  i want to help big factories and small businesses double their exports  we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  we can make that happen  but i'm going to need your help  number two  i want us to control more of our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  we've doubled the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar  thousands of americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long lasting batteries  today  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than any time in nearly two decades  so now you've got a choice  you can do what mr  romney wants to do and reverse all that progress   i audience members i  no   i the president   i or we can build on it  i'm not going to let oil companies write this country's energy plan  i don't want them to keep collecting another   billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers  we've got a better plan where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal technology and farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and our trucks  where we're putting more construction workers back to work retrofitting homes and factories so they waste less energy  we can develop nearly a hundred year supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet  and my plan would cut our oil imports in half by   and support more than   new jobs in natural gas alone  but i'm going to need your help to make it happen  number three  i want to give more americans the chance to learn the skills they need to compete  governor warner senator warner said it well  we've got to invest in our workforce  and education was the gateway of opportunity for me  it was the gateway of opportunity for michelle  it's the gateway of opportunity for many of you  it's the gateway to a middle class life  and we've already been working on this  so millions of students are right now paying less for college because we took on a system that was wasting billions of dollars in taxpayer money to banks and lenders  we said  let's give it directly to students  but now you've got a choice  the other side  they want to gut education to pay for more tax breaks for the wealthy  i think that's the wrong way to go  i think we can decide that in the united states of america  no child should have her dream deferred because of an overcrowded classroom  no family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they didn't have the money  no company should have to look for workers in china because they couldn't find ones with the right skills right here in virginia  so i'm asking you to help me recruit   math and science teachers in the next   years and improve early childhood education  let's give   million workers the chance to learn skills at a community colleges for jobs that are hiring right now  and let's work to with colleges and universities to cut the growth of tuition costs  because we don't want our young people loaded up with debt  we want them to be able to get the education they need to compete in the  st century  that's the path we have to choose together  that's what we're fighting for  fourth  we've got to reduce our deficit  and i put forward a plan that independent experts have looked at the numbers  it cuts the deficit by   trillion without sticking it to the middle class  now  i've already worked with the republicans to cut a trillion dollars in spending  and i'm willing to do more  i want to reform our tax code so it's simpler and fairer  but the only way we're going to reduce the deficit is also to ask wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over   to go back to the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  our economy created nearly   million new jobs  we went from deficit to surplus  and we created a whole lot of millionaires to boot  and understand  the reason why i want to do this  it's because that's how an economy grows  if we keep taxes low for middle class families  if you've got a little more money in your pocket  what do you do   u u i audience members i u u  spend it u   u u u i the president i u u   u u you spend it  maybe you buy that new computer for your kid  maybe you finally trade in that  year old car you've got  and that means that business now has more customers  and they're making more profits  which means they hire more workers  everybody does better when we're growing together  now  my opponent  he's got a plan  too  but as president clinton pointed out  there's no math in it   i laughter i  it's missing arithmetic  they say the biggest priority  we've got to reduce our debt  reduce our deficit  you see their ads  oh  we've got to reduce our deficit  and then the first thing they want to do is spend trillions of dollars on new tax breaks for the wealthy  and when you ask them  well  how does that work  they can't explain it  they won't say how they'd pay for   trillion in new tax cuts without raising taxes on middle class families  they want to spend another   trillion on new military spending that our military says we don't need  the reason they can't explain it is because the math doesn't work  and i tell you what  i want you to be clear  virginia  i want to work with republicans to reduce our deficit  i don't want continued gridlock on capitol hill  but i'm not ashamed to say i will refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising kids just so millionaires get another tax cut  i refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children off of head start programs or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans  including the poor and the elderly and the disabled  just to pay for more tax cuts that we can't afford  and i promise you  i will refuse to turn medicare into a voucher  americans who have worked hard shouldn't have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  they should retire with the care and the dignity they have earned  so we'll reform and strengthen medicare for the long haul  but we'll do it by reducing the cost of health care  not by dumping those costs onto seniors  just like we'll keep the promise of social security  but we will not be slashing benefits or turning it over to wall street  like some have proposed  that's the wrong way to go  now  virginia  i've talked about what we need to do here at home  but it's connected to what we do abroad  four years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  and i did  i said we'd wind down the war in afghanistan  and we are  thirty three thousand more troops have now left afghanistan  meanwhile  a new tower is rising above the new york skyline  al qaida is on the path to defeat  usama bin laden is dead  but as we saw last week  we still face serious threats in the world  we have to make sure that not only our military  but also our diplomats overseas are protected  we've got to go after anybody who harms americans overseas  and as long as i am commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  and when our troops come home and take off their uniform  we will serve them as well as they've served us  because nobody who have who has fought for us should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  now  my opponent has got a different idea  he says it was  tragic  to end the war in iraq  still won't tell us how he'd end the war in afghanistan  i have  and i will  and i'll use the money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more folks to work back here in the united states rebuilding roads and bridges  runways  broadband lines  schools  after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building right here at home  so that's the choice we now face  this is what the election comes down to  over and over  we've been told by the other side  the opponent  that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way to go  that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  their basic attitude is  you're on your own  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if some plant is releasing pollution into the air that your children breathe  well  that's the price of progress  if you can't afford to go to college  just borrow some money from your parents   i laughter i  i've got a different vision  i don't think that's who we are  i don't think that's what this country is about  we don't think government can solve all our problems  but we don't think government is the source of all our problems either   i audience members i  no   i the president i  we don't think anybody is the source of all our problems  not welfare recipients  not corporations  not unions  not immigrants  not gays  not all the other groups that we're told to blame for our troubles  because we believe that here in america we're all in it together  we believe america only works when we accept responsibility for ourselves  but also certain responsibilities for each other and for our country  to create a country that's filled with more opportunity and possibility than any other nation on earth  we understand that america is not what can be done for us  but what can be done by us together  as one nation  as one people  and that's what the campaign was about   years ago  i'll say it again  it was not about me  it was about you  you were the change  you were the reason a mother from leesburg doesn't have to worry about her son being denied medical coverage due to his heart condition  you made that happen  you're the reason a veteran in virginia beach can go to college on the new gi bill  you did that  you're the reason a middle class family here in virginia got a tax cut  money they're using to buy groceries and put gas in the car  maybe pay off some hospital bills when their daughter was born  that's because of you  you're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and pledged allegiance to our flag is no longer going to be deported from the only country she's ever known  you're the reason why an outstanding soldier won't be kicked out of our military just because of who he loves  you're the reason why families all across this country can welcome home loved ones who served us so bravely  give them that hug  know they're back and safe  you're the reason  that's how change happened  now  yesterday i made this same point at a town hall in florida  i said  one thing i've learned is that you can't change washington just from the inside  you change it from the outside  you change it because people are mobilized  you change it with the help of ordinary americans who are willing to make their voices heard because of the decency and the goodness and the common sense of americans  that's what moves the country forward  now  for some reason  my opponent got really excited  he rewrote his speech real quick   i laughter i  he stood up at a rally  proudly declared   i'll get the job done from the inside   i laughter i  what kind of inside job is he talking about  is it the job of rubberstamping the top down  you're on your own agenda of this republican congress  because if it is  we don't want it  if it's the job of letting oil companies run our energy policy  we don't want it   i audience members i  no   i the president i  if it's the job of outsourcers writing our tax code  we don't want it   i audience members i  no   i the president i  if it's the job of letting politicians decide who you can marry  or control the health care choices that women should be able to make for themselves  we'll take a pass  we don't want an inside job in washington  we want change in washington  and from the day we began this campaign  we've always said that change takes more than one term or even one president  and it certainly takes more than one party  it can't happen if you write off half the nation before you even took office  in     percent of the country didn't vote for me  but on the night of the election  i said to all those americans   i may not have won your vote  but i hear you voices  i need your help  and i will be your president  and for everybody who is watching or anybody here who is still undecided  i don't know how many people are going to vote for me this time around  but i applause i hold on but i'm telling the american people i will be fighting for you no matter what  i will be your president no matter what  i'm not fighting to create democratic jobs or republicans jobs  i'm fighting to create american jobs  i'm not fighting to improve red state schools or blue state schools  i'm fighting to improve schools in the united states of america  the values we believe in don't just belong to workers or businesses  the   percent or the   percent  the rich or the poor  the   percent  the   percent  these are american values  they belong to all of us  virginia  i still believe we're not as divided as our politics suggests  i still believe we've got more in common than the pundits tell us  i believe in you  i still believe in your capacity to help me bring about change  and i'm asking you to keep believing in me  i'm asking for your vote  and if you're willing to stand with me and work with me  we'll win prince william county  we will win virginia  we'll finish what we've started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  wisconsin  oh  you guys sound like you're fired up already  it is good to be back in milwaukee  first of all  it's good to be back because this is the closest i've been to home in a couple of months  i was thinking about hopping on the freeway and just driving on down   i laughter i  hour and a half  maybe a little shorter with the motorcade   i laughter i  i am also glad to be in milwaukee because before i came out here  i was able to have an outstanding sampling of bratwurst from milwaukee  i'm also glad to be here because i get to see some great friends like your mayor  tom barrett  who's in the house  your outstanding senator herb kohl  and your next united states senator  tammy baldwin  and  just to prove that i am determined to bring everyone together in moving this country forward  i am proud to have a couple of green bay packers in the house  we've got your jermichael finley  we've got desmond bishop  and they were pointing out the results of the most recent bears packers game  all i could say to them is  it's a long season   i laughter i  we're going to play you a couple more times  but we're so glad that they are here  and it just goes to show you  we are not as divided as some people think  we are not bears fans first or packers fans first  we are americans first  now  unless you've been hiding under a rock or your television is busted  you probably know that we've got an election going on  i was telling folks about a story recently i heard my campaign manager was talking to this couple  they had this  year old with them  and they saw a picture of me  and the parents said   who's that  sammy  and the little boy says   that's barack obama  and then they asked   what does barack obama do  and he thinks for a second  and he says   he approves that message   i laughter i  so that's what i do  i approve this message   i laughter i  and that's because  when you heard mark up here talking and give mark a big round of applause for the great job he did what you heard from mark is that we've got a very big choice to make in this election  and it's not just between two candidates or two parties  it's a choice between two different paths for america  two different visions for our future  now  my opponent  he believes in top down economics   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote   i applause i  vote  but he thinks that if we just spend another   trillion on tax cuts for the wealthiest americans all our problems are going to go away  jobs and prosperity will rain down on everybody  deficits will magically disappear  it will all end happily ever after  but there's a problem with that  we tried what they're selling  we tried it for a decade  it didn't work then  and it won't work now  this country does not succeed when only a very few do well  america succeeds when working families do well  when middle class folks do well  when folks working hard to get into the middle class do well  when everybody has got a chance to get ahead  that's when we do well  we can't move forward if we've got leaders who write off half the nation  calling them a bunch of victims who will never take responsibility for their lives   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i don't see a lot of victims here today  i see hard working wisconsinites  i see students trying to work their way through college  i see single moms putting in overtime to make sure their kids have a shot  i see senior citizens who've been saving their entire lives for their retirement  i see veterans who have served our country bravely  i see soldiers who defend our freedom today  milwaukee  we don't believe anybody is entitled to success  we don't believe government should help folks who don't try to help themselves  but we do believe in something called opportunity  we believe that in this country hard work should pay off and everybody should get a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same rules  that's the country we believe in  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  wisconsin  the truth is  the path i'm offering is not going to be quick  it won't be easy  it's going to take a few years to solve challenges that have built up over decades  but i want everybody here to understand  there's no problem we cannot solve  there is no challenge we cannot meet  because we've got the best workers in the world  we've got the best businesses in the world  we got the best scientists and researchers in the world  we've got the best colleges and universities in the world  we've got this incredible diversity of talent  which is why people want to come here from every corner of the globe  there's not a country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states  but we're going to have to work hard to achieve that potential  that's why i put forward a practical plan to create jobs and grow the middle class and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation  it starts by exporting more products  but outsourcing fewer jobs  you remember my opponent wanted to let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  so we said  no  too much is at stake  we're going to come together and reinvent a dying auto industry  and we put it back on top of the world  so what we did for autos  we want to do for manufacturing across the board  we've already created more than half a million new manufacturing jobs  so now what we have to do is to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  let's give them to companies that are investing right here in milwaukee  creating jobs right here in wisconsin  that's how we move forward  let's help big companies and small businesses double their exports  we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  but it requires you to vote  it requires all of us to do our part  i want us to control our own energy  after   years of not doing anything  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  we have doubled the amount of renewable energy we generate  and thousands of americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long lasting batteries  we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in nearly two decades  so my opponent  he wants to let the oil companies write the energy plan   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  he wants to keep giving   billion in corporate welfare to him from our taxpayers  we've got a better plan  we want to produce oil and natural gas  but we also want to invest in wind and solar and clean coal  we want to bring farmers and scientists together to harness new biofuels  we want to put construction workers back to work building homes and factories that use and waste less energy  we want to develop a hundred year supply of natural gas  we want to cut our oil imports in half by   and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process  we can do it  but i'm going to need your help  i'm going to need you to vote  i want to make sure that we've got the best education system on earth  i wouldn't be standing here unless i got a great education  it was the gateway of opportunity for me and for michelle and for so many of you  and that's why we fought so hard to make sure that millions of students are paying less for college  because we took on a system that was wasting billions of dollars and started giving that money to students  now  my opponent  he wants to gut our investments in education to give tax breaks to the wealthy   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  i've got a different vision  i believe that in the united states of america  no child should have her dream deferred because of an overcrowded classroom  no family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money  no company should have to look for workers in china because they can't find the right skills here in the united states  so  wisconsin  i want you to help me recruit   new math and science teachers  let's improve early childhood education  let's give   million more workers the chance to get the skills they need at community colleges  let's help colleges and universities keep tuition down  we can meet these goals together  but i'm going to need your help  we need to bring down our deficit  but we don't need to do it by sticking it to the middle class  i put forward a plan that reduces our deficit by   trillion  we've already cut a trillion dollars of spending that we didn't need  and i'm willing to do more to make sure our government is efficient  we can't be wasting money  but i also want to reform our tax code so that it's simple and fair  and so it asks the wealthiest among us to pay a higher rate on incomes over   that's the rate we had when bill clinton was president  and our economy created nearly   million new jobs  we went from deficit to surplus  and by the way  we created a whole lot of millionaires to boot  i've cut taxes for the middle class  i've cut taxes for small businesses  and i want to keep your taxes low  but i can afford to pay a little more  and mitt romney sure can afford to pay a little more  and the reason i want to do it is not because i want to punish success  it's when you give tax relief to middle class families  what do you do when you got a little more money in your pocket   i audience members i  we spend it   i the president i  you spend it  so maybe you trade in that old  year old car  maybe you buy a computer for your kid  and that means business has more customers  which means they companies have more profits  which means then they hire more people  and then the whole economy gets stronger  we don't build the economy from the top down  we build it from the bottom up  from the middle out  that's what we're fighting for  now  i've got to say  in fairness  my   i audience member i  we love you  obama   i the president i  i love you back  that's why i want to make sure you've got a good deficit reduction plan   i laughter i  look  my opponents  they've got a plan too  the problem is  like bill clinton said  there's no arithmetic in it   i laughter i  somehow  they think that they can spend trillions of dollars more on tax cuts for the wealthy and somehow bring down our deficit  they can't say how they'll do it  they won't say how you have a   trillion in new tax cuts and not end up raising taxes on middle class families or spend another   trillion in new military spending that our military says we don't need without asking you to foot the bill  the math just doesn't add up  and i've got to tell you  milwaukee  i refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deduction for owning a home or raising kids just to give millionaires a tax cut  i refuse to ask college students to pay more or kick children off of head start programs or eliminate health insurance for millions of poor and elderly and disabled just to pay for another tax cut we can't afford  i will not turn medicare into a voucher program  and we are not going to end up creating a social security system that is controlled by wall street  we are going to make sure that everybody can retire with dignity and respect  that's what we're fighting for  now  i know we're getting a little wet  but that's okay  i'm going to wrap it up  but i've got a few more things to say  just like we've got choices here at home  we've also got some choices overseas  our prosperity at home depends on our security overseas  four years ago  i said i would end the war in iraq  and i did  i said we'd wind down the war in afghanistan  and we are  a new tower is rising over the new york skyline  al qaida is on the path to defeat  and usama bin laden is dead  now  as we saw last week   i audience members i  u s a  u s a  u s a   i the president i  now  as we saw last week  we've still got threats out there  we saw the attack on our consulate  and we will bring those murderers to justice  and that's why as long as i am commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  and when our troops come home  and they take off their uniform  we will serve them as well as they have served us  because if you served in our military  if you protected our people  if you fought for our freedom  you shouldn't have to fight for a job when you come home  mitt romney  he thinks that it was  tragic  for us to end the war in iraq  he doesn't have a plan to end the war in afghanistan  i have  and i will  and i'll use the money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put folks back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges  after a decade of war  we need to do some nation building here at home  so i know you're getting wet  but i've got one more thing to say  a little rain never hurt anybody  let me say this  my opponents  they will keep on over the next   days spending more money than we've ever seen before  trying to tell you that tax cuts are the only way to go  that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  their basic philosophy is you're on your own  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if you can't afford to go to college  try to borrow some money from your parents   i laughter i  let me tell you something  that's not who we are  i don't think government can solve all of our problems  but i don't think it's the source of all our problems  i don't want to spend all our time blaming somebody else  blaming unions or blaming immigrants or blaming gay people or blaming some other group for our troubles  i believe we're all in it together  i believe we've got to take responsibility for ourselves  but also look out for one another  i think we have a responsibility to create opportunity and possibility in this nation  i don't think america is just about what can be done for us  it's about what can be done by us together  as one nation  as one people  that's what our election was   years ago  it was about you  you were the change  all of us coming together  you're the reason there's a mother in madison who doesn't have to worry about her son being denied medical coverage because of a preexisting condition  you made that happen  you're the reason there's a student at marquette or university of wisconsin who can afford to go to college now  or a veteran on the new gi bill  you accomplished that  you're the reason there's a family in green bay that got a tax cut and has a little more money to buy groceries and put gas in the car and pay the bills  you're the reason that some young immigrant who grew up here and pledges allegiance to our flag won't be deported  you're the reason why an outstanding soldier can still serve in our military  because it doesn't matter who they love  we ended  don't ask  don't tell  you did that  you're the reason that those families are welcoming home their incredible men and women who served us so bravely  you did that  i was trying to make this point the other day in florida  and i said  you can't change washington just from the inside  i've learned that  you've got to enlist and mobilize the american people to help bring about change from the outside  mitt romney heard me say that  he said he started changing his speech  he's said  oh  oh he got all excited i laughter i i think obama made a gaffe  so he stood up  and he said  i'll get the job done from the inside  and that made me want to ask  what kind of inside job is he talking about   i laughter i  we don't if it's one of those inside jobs where he's rubberstamping the agenda of this republican congress  we don't want that  if it's the job of letting oil companies write our energy policy or our insurance companies writing our health care policies   i audience members i  no   i the president   i or our outsourcers writing tax codes   i audience members i  no   i the president   i that's not the inside job we want   i audience members i  no   i the president i  if it's one of those inside jobs where politicians in washington tell women that they can't make decisions about their own health care choices  we don't want that  we don't want that inside job from washington  we've always said in this campaign that change takes more than one term  it takes more than one president  it takes more than one party  it can't happen if you write off half the nation  in     percent of the country didn't vote for me  but i said to those folks on election night  i said  i may not have won your vote  but i hear your voices  i need your help  i will be your president too  so i don't know how many folks will vote for me this time around  but i can tell you  i'll be with you  no matter what  because i'm not fighting to create democratic jobs or republican jobs  i'm fighting to create american jobs  i'm not fighting to improve schools in red states or schools in blue states  i'm fighting to improve schools in the united states  i'm not fighting just on behalf of workers or businesses or rich or poor  the   percent or the   percent  i'm fighting for american values  they belong to all of us  and if you still believe in that  if you still have hope  if you're still ready to go  i'm asking you for your vote  if you get out there and work these last   days  if you're willing to make some phone calls for me and knock on some doors for me and vote for me  we'll win milwaukee  we'll win wisconsin  we'll finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  the sun is going to come out  god bless you  god bless the united states "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  bowling green  oh  hello  falcons  thank you so much  thank you  now  let me begin by asking everybody to give seth a big round of applause for that great introduction  i was backstage  and i had trouble hearing  did he explain what was going on with his arm  so seth was playing  i think ultimate frisbee  that's what it was   i laughter i  he was playing ultimate frisbee  he went up  he was going to make this amazing touchdown  and he had the frisbee  and somebody cut him under his legs  cut out from under him  it is clear replacement refs were in the game   i laughter i  he broke his wrist  he was supposed to get it set yesterday  but he didn't want to miss this  so when he came up here  his wrist was not yet set  and he's going to have to go to the hospital afterwards to get his wrist set  now  i just want to make the point that if seth can come up here with a broken wrist  then there is not a student here who cannot get registered and make sure they go to vote  no excuses   i applause i  no excuses  you got to play through injuries  falcons   i laughter i   i audience member i  i love you   i the president i  i love you back  i'm good i'm glad to be here  now  it's great to be here with your next congresswoman  angela zimmann  i'm thrilled to be with all of you  and unless you live under a rock or your cable is busted  you may have noticed that there's an election going on here in ohio  by the way  those of you guys who have seats  feel free to sit down  i'm going to be talking for a while here   i laughter i  and those of you who don't  make sure to bend your knees  because sometimes  people faint  fall out  not because i'm so exciting  but just because you've been standing a long time   i laughter i  so there's an election going on here in ohio  and in case you're wondering what kind of impact that's having  i was talking to my campaign manager  he was meeting with this couple who had this adorable  year old son named sammy  and they were very proud that sammy knew what was going on  and there was a picture of me up on the wall  and the parents said   who's that  sammy  and sammy said   that's barack obama  and then the parents asked   and what does barack obama do  and sammy thinks for a second  and he says   he approves this message   i laughter i  true story   i applause i  true story  that's what i do  i approve this message   i laughter i  and  ohio  that's because  starting on october   which is just   days from now  you get to start voting  you get to have your say  you can register to vote all the way up until october   but if you're already registered you can start voting in   days  and this is important  because you've got a big choice to make  and it's not just a choice between two parties or two candidates  it is a choice between two fundamentally different paths for america  two fundamentally different choices for our future  my opponent and his running mate are big believers in top down economics  they basically think that if we just spend another   trillion on tax cuts that favor the very wealthiest  then   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote   i applause i  vote  vote  vote  but their theory is  these tax cuts for the folks at the top  then prosperity and jobs will rain down on everybody else  the deficit will magically go away  and we will live happily ever after  there's only one problem  we just tried this during the last decade  during the previous presidency  it didn't work  top down economics never works  the country doesn't succeed when only the rich get richer  we succeed when the middle class gets bigger  when more people have a chance to get ahead  more people have a chance to live up to their god given potential  look  i don't believe we can get very far with leaders who write off half the nation as a bunch of victims who never take responsibility for their own lives  and i've got to tell you  as i travel around ohio and as i look out on this crowd  i don't see a lot of victims  i see hard working ohioans  that's what i see  we've got students who are trying to work their way through college  we've got single moms who are putting in overtime to raise their kids  by the way  your outstanding president of this institution  bowling green charming woman  really smart and there she is right there  we were talking  because we both were raised by single moms  and she was telling the story about how her mom worked at a resort in west virginia  but she was doing the hard work and ended up raising one college president and one federal judge  that's what we believe about the economy  when you give folks a chance  i see in this audience senior citizens who have been saving for retirement their entire lives  veterans who served this country so bravely  soldiers who are today defending our freedom  look  so let's just get something straight in case anybody is confused  we don't believe that anybody is entitled to success in this country  we don't believe government should be helping people who refuse to help themselves  but we do believe in something called opportunity  we do believe that hard work should pay off  we do believe in an america where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules  we do believe in an america where no matter who you are or what you look like or what you're your last name is or who you love  you can make it if you try  that's the country i believe in  that's what i've been fighting for for   years  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  i've got to say this  this country has gone through a very tough time  and we've still got a lot of folks who are hurting out there  and i'm not somebody who is coming here offering some easy  quick solutions  the truth is it's going to take more than a few years to solve the challenges that were building up over decades  jobs being shipped overseas  paychecks flat  even as costs of everything from college to health care were going up   i audience member   i i inaudible i i i in ohio   i the president i  that too  but here is what i want everybody to be confident about  our problems can be solved  our challenges can be met  we've still got the best workers in the world  we've got the best businesses in the world  we've got the best scientists in the world and researchers  we definitely have the best colleges and universities in the world  so especially for the young people out here  i want you to understand  there is not a country on earth that wouldn't gladly trade places with the united states of america  but we've got work to do  we've got work to do  and the path i'm offering may be harder  but it leads to a better place  and i'm putting forward a practical  five point plan to create jobs and to grow the middle class and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation  so just in case you guys missed the convention and i laughter i i know you didn't miss michelle  so i applause i  let me reprise what this plan consists of  first  i want to export more products and outsource fewer jobs  when my opponent said we should just  let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  that would have meant walking away from an industry that supports one in eight ohio jobs  it supports businesses in   of   ohio counties  so when he said that  i said  no  i'm going to bet on america  i'm betting on american workers  i'm betting on american industry  and today  the american auto industry has come roaring back with nearly   new jobs  and now you've got a choice  we can give more tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs right here in the united states  now  i understand my opponent has been spending some time here in ohio lately  and he's been talking tough on china  have you been hearing this   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  he's been talking tough on china  he says he's going to take the fight to them  he's going to go after these cheaters  and i've got to admit  that message is the better is better than what he's actually done about this thing   i laughter i  it sounds better than talking about all the years he spent profiting from companies that sent our jobs to china  so when you hear this newfound outrage  when you see these ads he's running promising to get tough on china  it feels a lot like that fox saying   you know  we need more secure chicken coops   i laughter i  i mean  it's just not credible  now  ohio  i'll tell you what i've done  because i'm not just talking the talk  i have woken up every single day doing everything i can to give american workers a fair shot in this global economy  so we've brought more trade cases against china in one term than the previous administration did in two  and by the way  we've been winning those cases  we've stood up for autoworkers against unfair trade practices  when governor romney said stopping an unfair surge in chinese tires would be bad for america  bad for our workers  we politely declined his advice  we went after china on that  and we got over a hundred a thousand american workers back to work producing american tires  so when you want if you want to know who is going to actually fight for workers and fight for american jobs when it comes to trade  you can look at the records  you can look at who said what before election time  and right now i am asking you to choose a better path than the one that my opponent's offering  one that helps big factories and small businesses double their exports  that sells more goods stamped with  made in america  to the rest of the world  we can create one million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years with the right policies  that's what i'm fighting for  that's why i'm running for a second term as president  that's what's going to be important to ohio  second part of the plan  i want us to control more of our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  we've doubled the amount of renewable clean energy we generate from sources like wind and solar  there are thousands of americans including here in ohio who have jobs today building wind turbines and long lasting batteries  today  america is less dependent on foreign oil than any time in nearly   years  so now you've got a choice between a plan that builds on this progress or a plan that reverses it like my opponent's suggesting  and this is a clear plan  because a clear difference  because i will not let oil companies write this country's energies plan  and i want to stop oil companies collecting another   billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers  we have a better plan  let's take that money we're giving to companies that are already hugely profitable every time you go to the pump  they're making money  they don't need a tax break let's use that money and invest in wind and solar and clean coal technology  let's help farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and our trucks  let's put construction workers to work retrofitting homes and factories so they waste less energy  let's develop a hundred year supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet  and if we do all these things  we can cut our oil imports even more  cut them in half by   and support hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the process  that's why i'm running  that's what's going to be good for ohio  number three  i want to give more americans the chance to get the skills that they need to compete   i audience member i  apprenticeships   i the president i  that's a good idea  education  it was my gateway to opportunity  that's the only reason i'm standing here  it was michelle's path to opportunity  it's the path more than ever to a middle class life  today  millions of students are paying less for college because we took on a system that was wasting billions of dollars using banks and lenders as middlemen on the student loan process  we said  let's give that money directly to students  and as a consequence  millions of students are getting more grants  and we kept interest rates on students' loans low  all right  that's what we fought for  that's what we fought for  we already got that done  so now you've got a choice  because my opponent  he would gut education to pay for more tax breaks for the wealthy  that's one choice  that's door number one  door number two  we can decide that the united states of america should never have a child's dreams deferred just because she's in a overcrowded classroom or a crumbling school or has outdated textbooks  no family should have to set aside an acceptance letter to a college like bowling green because they don't have the money  you know  no company should have to look for workers in china because they can't find workers with the right skills here in the united states  that's not the future that we want  so  ohio  i need your help  because i want to recruit   new math and science teachers  and i want to improve early childhood education  i want to give   million more workers the chance to learn skills that they need at community colleges that will directly lead to a job  and i want to work with college presidents to keep tuition costs down  we can cut in half the growth of tuition if we're focused on this  we can meet this goal  you can choose that future  that's why i'm running  because i want to make sure that the folks coming behind me have the same opportunities i had  that's what america is about  number four  i want to reduce the deficit without sticking it to the middle class  now  i've already worked with republicans in congress to cut a trillion dollars in spending  and i'm willing to do more  i put forward a very specific plan    trillion in deficit reduction  i want to simplify the tax code so that it's fair  but i also want to ask the wealthiest households to pay a higher rate on incomes over   the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  our economy created nearly   million new jobs  we had the biggest surplus in history  and by the way  a whole lot of millionaires did really well too  because that's how you grow an economy  i want to keep taxes low for middle class families and working families  but if we're going to close the deficit  we've got to ask folks like me to do a little bit more  and understand what happens  when you get a tax break  what do you do  you spend it  because you've got times are already tough  so maybe you trade in finally that  year old car  or maybe you a buy a computer for your kid who's about to go off to college  and that mean business now has more customers and they make more profits  which means they hire more workers  and the whole economy does better  that's how you grow an economy  from the middle out  not from the top down  and that's also how we'll reduce our deficit  now  in fairness  my opponent has a plan  too  the problem is it's missing what president clinton called arithmetic   i laughter i  so just understand my opponent and his allies in congress tell us somehow we can lower the deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy  no matter how many times they promise to  reboot  their campaign  no matter how many times they start saying they're going to explain the specifics of this thing  they can't  they won't  they can't say how they'd pay for   trillion in tax cuts without raising taxes on middle class families  they can't explain how they're going to pay for   trillion in new military spending that our military has said won't make us safer  they can't explain it because the math doesn't add up  now  my opponent may think it's fair that somebody who makes   million a year  like he does  pays a lower rate than a teacher or an autoworker who makes   a year  but i disagree  i don't think that's fair  i don't think it helps grow our economy  i refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or looking after their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  we're not going to do that   i applause i  we're not going to do that  i'm not going to ask the students here to pay more for college or kick some kids off of head start or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans who are poor or elderly or disabled just to give myself a tax cut  we can't afford it  and i want you guys to know  i will never turn medicare into a voucher  no american should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  they should retire with dignity and the respect that they've earned  we'll reform and strengthen medicare for the long haul  but we'll do it by reducing the actual cost of care  not by dumping those costs onto seniors  and we're going to keep the promise of social security  we'll strengthen it  but we're not going to turn it over to wall street  we're not going to do that  now  obviously  governor romney and i have a lot of differences when it comes to domestic policy  but our prosperity here at home is linked to what happens abroad  four years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  we did  i said we'd responsibly wind down the war in afghanistan  and we are  you've got a new tower that's rising over the new york skyline  and meanwhile  al qaida is on the path to defeat and osama bin laden is dead  we made that commitment  but as we saw just a few days ago  we still face some serious threats in the world  and that's why  as long as i'm commander in chief  we're going to maintain the strongest military the world has ever known  and when our troops come home and they take off their uniform  we're going to serve them as well as they've served us  because nobody who fights for america should have to fight for a job when they come home  i believe that  my opponent has got a different view  he said the way we ended the war in iraq was  tragic  he still hasn't explained what his policy in afghanistan will be  but i have  and i will  and i one more thing  i will use the money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and to put more people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways  because after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building right here in ohio  right here at home   i applause i  right here at home  so this is the choice that you face  this is what this election comes down to  and over the next   days  you will be seeing more money than has ever been spent and a whole bunch of it on the other side from folks who are writing   million checks to these super pacs  and they'll tell you that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way to go  their basic argument is since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  their basic theory is you're on your own  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick   i laughter i  if a company is releasing toxic pollution that your kids are breathing  well  that's the price of progress  if you can't afford to start a business or go to college  just borrow more money from your parents   i laughter i  let me tell you something  that's not who we are  that's not what this country is about  we don't think government can solve all our problems  but we don't think it's the source of all our problems  either  just like we don't think that folks who are having a tough time are our problem or welfare recipients are our problem or corporations are our problem or unions are our problem or immigrants or gays or all the other groups that we're told to blame for our troubles  because here in america  we believe we're in this thing together  we believe that all of us have responsibilities  we believe we've got responsibilities to look after ourselves and work hard and show individual initiative  but we also believe we have responsibilities to each other and to this country and to future generations  to make sure that america continues to be the place where there's more opportunity and possibility than any other nation on earth  that's what we believe  that's what we're fighting for  we understand that america is not about what can be done for us  it's about what can be done by us  together  as one nation and as one people  and that's what i've always said  that's why i ran for this office  because i have faith in you  four years ago  i told you this wasn't about me  it was about you  the american people  you were the change  you are the reason a mother in cleveland right now doesn't have to worry about her son being denied medical coverage because of some preexisting condition  you made that happen  you are the reason a factory worker who lost his job in toledo or lordstown is back on the line building some of the best cars in the world  you did that  you're the reason a student in akron or columbus or bowling green has some help paying for a college education  you're the reason a veteran can go to school on the new gi bill  you're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to the flag is not in danger of being deported from the only country she's ever known  you're the reason some outstanding soldier won't be kicked out of our military because of who they are or who they love  you're the reason why thousands of families have finally been able to welcome home their loved ones who served us so bravely  to say   welcome home  and the interesting thing is  my opponent maybe doesn't understand this concept about how change happens  because i made this point down in florida  i said one of the things we learned is  we can't change washington just from the inside  you got to change it from the outside  you change it with the help of ordinary americans who are willing to make their voices heard  and my opponent got really excited  he heard me say this  he changed his speech   i laughter i  he said  i'm going to get the job done from the inside  that's what he said  i'm going to get the job done from the inside  and i'm thinking to myself  well  what kind of inside job is he talking about   i laughter i  is he talking about the inside job to rubberstamp the agenda of this republican congress  because if he is  we don't want it  if he's talking about the inside job of letting oil companies write the energy policies and insurance companies writing health care policies and outsourcers rewriting our tax code  we don't need that  if he's talking about the inside job where politicians in washington are controlling the health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making for themselves  we'll take a pass  we don't need an inside job  we want to change washington  i've always said change is hard  it takes more than one term or even one president  and the way our democracy works  we're never going to get everything that each of us individually want  but if we're working together  you can make things happen  now  you can't make it happen if you write off half the nation before you take office  it's interesting  in     percent of the country did not vote for me  they voted for john mccain  but on election night  in grant park in chicago  i said to all those americans who didn't vote for me  i said  i may not have won your vote  but i hear your voices  and i need your help  and i will be your president too  that's what i said  so i don't know how many votes i'll get in ohio this time  but no matter who you are  no matter what party you belong to and i want everybody who's listening on television to understand i will be fighting for you  because i'm not fighting to create democratic jobs or republican jobs  i'm fighting to create american jobs  i'm not fighting to improve blue state schools or red state schools  i'm fighting to improve schools in the united states of america  the values of hard work and personal responsibility  those values that we believe in don't just belong to workers or businesses or the rich or the poor  the   percent or the   percent  the   percent or the   percent  those are american values  they belong to all of us  so i want you guys to understand we are not as divided as our politics suggests  i still believe  no matter how many times i'm called naive about this  i still believe that we have more in common than divides us  i still believe in that  i still believe in one nation and one people  i still believe in you  and i'm asking you to keep believing in me  and if you do  i need you to register to vote  i need you to start voting   days from now on october   and if you're with me and if you work with me  we'll win wood county again  we'll win ohio again  we'll finish what we started  we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  everybody  god bless america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  kent state  hello  hello  ohio  go  flashes  well  let's begin by giving bryan a big round of applause for that outstanding introduction  i think bryan has got some talent  i think he may be going places  he sounded pretty good up here  i also want to acknowledge your outstanding congressman  tim ryan  who is here  and your mayor  jerry fiala  is here  and mrs  fiala is here  it's good to see all of you  thank you  thank you  now  let me say this  unless you live under a rock or you didn't pay your cable bill i laughter i you probably are aware that there's an election going on right now in ohio  i was telling the story about my campaign manager who was visiting with a young couple  they had this beautiful young son    years old  his name was sammy  and there was a picture of me on the wall or something  and they were all excited  they said   sammy  who's that  and sammy says   that's barack obama  and they said   well  what does barack obama do  and he thought about it for a minute  and sammy says   he approves this message   i laughter i  he approves this message  so you can tell there are too many ads running during election time  but it's true  i do approve this message  because  listen  here in ohio  starting on october   just   days from now  you get to start voting  you get to have your say  and for all the young people who are here  you can register all the way until october   but time is running short if you're not registered  so you've got to register  if you need to know how  go to gottagegister com  that's not  got to  that's  gotta  g o t t a register com  but if you're already registered  you can start voting in   days  days  it's coming up  and this is important because you've got a very big choice to make  in fact  those of you who are still standing  feel free to sit down because i'm going to talk for a while here   i laughter i  i want you to feel comfortable  because i'm going to see if i can break it down here  what this election is about  that's what i'm going to try to do   i applause i  that's what i'm going to try to do  this is not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties  this is a choice between two fundamentally different visions of our future  my opponent  he favors he believes in top down economics  he thinks that if we spend another   trillion on tax cuts that favor the wealthiest americans  then jobs and prosperity will rain down from the sky  everybody will be better off  we'll all live happily ever after  now   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  wait  don't boo  vote   i laughter i  vote  vote  and the problem with what he's trying to sell is  we just tried that in the last decade  it didn't work then  it won't work now  top down economics doesn't work  this country doesn't succeed when just the rich are getting richer  this country succeeds when the middle class is growing  when there are ladders of opportunity for all people  when everybody has the chance to live up to their god given potential  that's when america grows  that's when everybody does better  i don't believe we are going to get very far if we've got leaders who write off half the nation as a bunch of victims who don't take responsibility for their own lives  because  let me tell you  i have spent a lot of time in ohio  and i don't meet a lot of victims  i see a lot of hard working ohioans  you know  i see students who are trying to work their way through college  i see single moms  like my mom  putting in overtime to raise their kids right  i see senior citizens who've been saving their entire lives for retirement  veterans who served this country bravely  soldiers who defend our freedom today  now  we don't believe that anybody is entitled to success in this country  everybody's got to work hard  we don't believe government should help people who aren't trying to help themselves  that's not the american way  but we do believe in something called opportunity  we believe in a country where hard work pays off  where responsibility is rewarded  where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules  we believe in an america where no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or who you love  you can make it if you try  that's what i believe  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  now  i've said this before  and i will say it again  the path i'm offering is not quick or easy  the truth is  we've had problems that have been building up for decades  jobs being shipped overseas  paychecks shrinking even when the cost of everything is going up  so for the last   years  we've been working to start restoring that basic bargain that says  if you work hard  you can get ahead  but we've got a lot more to do   i audience member i  i love you  obama   i the president i  i love you back  but let me  but i want especially the young people to understand  you should feel confident about our future because our problems can be solved  our challenges can be met  we've still got the world's best workers  the best businesses  the best scientists  the best researchers  the best colleges and universities  so there's not a country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states  but we've got more work to do  and the path i'm offering  even though it's harder  it's going to lead to a better place  and in case some of you missed the convention or only watched michelle and didn't watch me i laughter i which i understand  let me repeat the plan that i put forward  practical  specific  five point plan to grow our middle class  create strong jobs here in ohio and around the country  and lay a stronger foundation for our economy  first thing is i want to see us export more jobs export more products  excuse me   i laughter i  i was channeling my opponent there for a second   i laughter i  i want to see us export more products and outsource fewer jobs  my opponent  several years ago  said let's  let detroit go bankrupt  and when he said that  he was talking about one in eight ohio jobs  businesses in   out of   ohio counties that count on the auto industry  and so we said  no  this may be hard and it may not be popular  but we're going to bet on american workers  we're going to bet on american manufacturing  and you know what  today  the american auto industry has come roaring back  with nearly   new jobs  and so now you've got a choice  we can give more tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  or we can reward companies that are opening new plants here in ohio  training new workers in here in america  creating new jobs here in america   i audience member i  i believe in you  barack   i the president i  because we've been working on it  you believe me   i laughter i  we don't just talk the talk  my opponent's been spending a lot of time in ohio lately  and he's been talking tough about china  he says he's going to take the fight right to them  he's going to go after the cheaters  he says  now  i've got to admit that the message he's delivering now is better than the one that he was delivering all those years he was profiting from investing in companies that were shipping jobs to china  when you hear his newfound outrage  when you see those ads he's running promising to get tough on china  it's sort of like the fox standing up and saying   you know  we need to keep the chicken coops more secure   i laughter i  it's just not very credible  because that's not where he's been  except during election season  now  on the other hand  you can look at what we've done  ever single day  i'm waking up thinking about how we strengthen the position of american workers  make sure they get a fair shot in the global economy  so we've brought more trade cases against china in one term than the previous administration did in two  and we've been winning  when governor romney said stopping an unfair surge in chinese tires would be bad for our workers and bad for america  we said  we're going to do it anyway  we didn't take his advice  and we got over   americans back to work  so you can look at what i've done  and you can look at what he's done  and you'll have a sense of who's going to be fighting for american workers  and you can look at his plan  and you can look at my plan  because he wants to keep open these tax loopholes that encourage jobs overseas  i want to make sure that we're providing tax breaks for companies right here in america  i want to help big factories and small businesses double their exports  i want more goods stamped with  made in america  i want to create   million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  that's what's at stake in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second terms as president of the united states  second part of the plan is to control more of our own energy  after   years of not doing anything  we raised fuel standards so by the next decade  middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that will save you money  and it will help the environment  and it will help the economy  we've doubled the amount of renewable energy that we're generating from wind and solar  we've got thousands of americans  including folks right here in ohio  who work today building wind turbines and long lasting batteries  today  america is less dependent on foreign oil than in nearly   years  think about that  so now you've got a choice  governor romney wants to reverse that progress  get rid of tax credits for things like wind energy  i've got a different view  unlike my opponent  i'm not going to let oil companies write this country's energy plan  and i'm sure not going to let them continue to collect   billion every single year in corporate welfare from our taxpayers  they don't need it   i applause i  they don't need it  they're making money every time you go to the pump  so let's take that   billion  and let's invest it in wind and solar  clean coal technology  let's help farmers and scientists harness the power of biofuels  let's put construction workers back to work retrofitting our buildings and our homes so they waste less energy  let's go after a hundred year supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet  we can create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and improve our economy  and we can cut in half our oil imports by   that's the goal that i am setting  that is what we're fighting for  that's why i'm running for a second term  i want to make sure that everybody in america gets a great education everybody  education was the gateway of opportunity for me  it was the only reason i'm standing here  i wasn't born to wealth or fame  but i got a great education  same thing for michelle  same thing for a lot of you  it's the gateway to the middle class  and so  again  we don't just talk the talk  we've walked the walk  we took on a system that was sending billions of dollars to banks and lenders in the student loan system  we said why do we need middlemen  let's give the loans directly to students  we can help keep interest rates low  we can provide more pell grants  that's what we've been fighting for  so  again  you've got a choice  because governor romney wants to roll back all that stuff we did   i audience member  i i inaudible i a shame   i the president i  it is a shame  so we can gut education to pay for more tax breaks for the wealthy  or we can decide that in the united states of america  no child should have her dreams deferred because of a overcrowded classroom  no family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money  no business should have to look for workers in china because they can't find ones with the right skills here in the united states  so  ohio  i am asking you to help me recruit   new math and science teachers  help me improve early childhood education  help me give   million workers the chance to learn the skills they need at community colleges that will lead directly to a new job  help us work with colleges and universities to cut the cost of tuition  help us meet those goals  help us choose that future for america  number four  let's reduce the deficit in a way that doesn't stick it to middle class families  i've already worked with republicans in congress to cut   trillion in spending  and i'm willing to do more  i've put forward a plan for a   trillion deficit reduction  but to do that  we can't just cut our way to prosperity  we've got to reform our tax code so that it's simple and it's fair  and ask the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over  to go back to the same rate we had when bill clinton was president when we created nearly   million new jobs and the biggest surplus in history and a whole lot of millionaires to boot  now  in fairness  my opponent has a plan too  when it comes to taxes  but as president clinton said  it doesn't have any arithmetic   i laughter i  they're trying to sell the idea that you can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions of dollars more on tax breaks for the wealthy  and no matter how many times they try to  reboot  their campaign  no matter how many times they try to tell you they're going to start talking specifics really soon  they don't do it  and the reason is because the math doesn't work  they do not  they cannot explain say how   trillion in tax cuts are going to be put on the table without raising taxes on middle class families  and that's they don't stop there  they want to spend another   trillion in new military spending that our military hasn't asked for  so the reason they don't explain it is because they can't  the math does not add up  so if they go around  as they have in ohio  with some board behind them with the numbers and saying how it's a moral obligation to reduce the deficit  just ask them  well  explain to us how the numbers work  because they don't  they don't have a deficit reduction plan  they have a deficit expansion plan  my governor romney may think it's fair that somebody who makes   million a year like he does should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or an autoworker who makes    i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  i don't think that's fair  i don't think it helps the economy grow  we cut taxes for middle class families  and we want to keep taxes low for   percent of americans    percent of small businesses  and the reason is  when middle class families have a little money in their pocket  what do they do   i audience members i  spend it   i the president i  yes  because you've got a lot of needs  the so you may end up trading in that  year old car  buying a new one  maybe you buy a new computer for your kid who is going off to college  and what happens when you spend money  that means businesses have more customers  they make more profits  they then hire more workers  the economy grows  that's what we did in the ' s  that's what we can do today  that's the way forward  so i'm looking forward to working with republicans to reduce our deficit  but i refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  we're not going to do that  i refuse to ask all the students here to pay more for college or to kick children off of head start programs so i can take a tax break that we don't need  we're not going to kick the poor and the elderly and the disabled out of health care to pay for a tax cut like that that doesn't help us grow  and i will not turn medicare into a voucher  i will not do that  after a lifetime of labor  no american should have their golden years  their retirement years  spent at the mercy of insurance companies  they should retire with dignity and respect  they've earned it  so we're going to we'll reform and strengthen medicare for the long haul  but we'll do it the right way  by actually reducing costs  not by dumping those costs onto seniors  same thing with social security  we'll take responsible steps to strengthen it  but we're not going to turn it over to wall street  now  obviously  we've been talking a lot about what happens here at home  but that's connected to what happens abroad  in   i said i'd end the war in iraq  and i did  i said that we'd wind down the war in afghanistan in a responsible way  and we are  because of the incredible service and sacrifice of our troops  a new tower is rising above the new york skyline  al qaida is on the path to defeat  usama bin laden is dead  but we still face serious threats in the world  and that's why  so long as i am commander in chief  we are going to maintain the strongest military the world's ever known  and when our troops come home and they take off that uniform  we're going to serve them as well as they've served us  because they shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when they come home  we deserve they deserve our honor and our respect  and we've got to do what we need to do to make sure they have opportunity in this country  but even on foreign policy  my opponent has a different view  he said it was  tragic  the way i ended the war in iraq  he still hasn't explained how he'd end the war in afghanistan  i have  and i will  and what i've also said is i'm going to use some of the money that we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and to put more people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways  because after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building right here at home  that's what we're going to start fighting for  so  kent state  that's the choice we now face  that's what this election comes down to  the other side  they like to tell you and they're going to spend a whole lot of money  they get these   million checks from these people who can afford to write   million  and they're going to run ad after ad  telling you that bigger tax cuts  fewer regulations  that's the only way to go  they're going to tell you that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  their basic theory is if you can't afford health care  hope you don't get sick   i laughter i  if some company is polluting the air your children are breathing  well  that's the price of progress  if you can't afford to go to college  borrow money from your parents   i laughter i  that's not who we are  that's not what we're about  government can't solve every problem  but it's not the source of all our problems either  just like we have this kind of politics where we pretend that somebody out there is to blame  welfare recipients or corporations or unions or immigrants or gays  that's not how this country works  here in america  we believe we're all in this together  we believe that america only works where we accept responsibility for ourselves  but we accept responsibility for the country and for each other  that's how we create opportunity  that's how we create possibility  we understand america is not about what can be done for us  but what can be done by us  together  as one nation and as one people  and we've got proof that this works  four years ago  i said this isn't about me  i said it was about you   i audience member i   i inaudible i   i the president i  that's what i said   i laughter i  so you're the reason that some mother in cleveland doesn't have to worry about her kid not getting health insurance because of a preexisting condition  you made that happen  you're the reason that factory worker in toledo or lordstown is back on the line building the best cars in the world  you're the reason some student in akron or columbus or at kent state can pay for a college education or some veteran can go to college on the new gi bill  you're the reason some young immigrant who was brought here as a kid and has been raised here and pledged allegiance to our flag is not suddenly going to be deported to a country she's never known  you're the reason why some outstanding soldier won't be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love  you're the reason why thousands of families have finally been able to say to the loved ones who served us so bravely   welcome home   i applause i  welcome home  you're the reason  you made that happen  i was talking about this down in florida the other day  i said  one thing i've learned is you can't just change washington from the inside  you've got to change it from the outside  you change it with the help of ordinary americans who are making their voices heard  and my opponent got real excited about this  he rewrote his speech  he said  the president has admitted defeat  he's waved the white flag  i'm going to get the job done from the inside  and i'm thinking  what kind of inside job is he talking about   i laughter i  is he talking about an inside job of rubberstamping a top down agenda from this republican congress  because if he is  we don't want it  is he talking about the inside job of having oil companies write our energy policies or our insurance companies writing our health care plans or folks who are outsourcing jobs writing our tax code  because if that's what he's talking about  we don't want it  is he talking about the inside job of having politicians control health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making themselves  because if he is  we don't want it  we don't need that  we don't need that inside job   i applause i  we don't need that  see  i believe in you   i applause i  i believe in you  i believe in your voices  from the beginning of this campaign  we've always said change takes more than one term  one year  one president  takes more than one party  it certainly doesn't happen if you write off half the nation before you even take office  you know  on election night    we were in grant park    percent of the american people didn't vote for me  they voted for   i audience member i  we got your back   i the president i  but no  no  percent of the country did not vote for me  but you know  i said to those americans specifically  i looked at the camera  and i said  i may not have won your vote  but i hear your voices  i need your help  i will be your president too  and so i'd say to the whole state of ohio  i don't know how many of you will be with me this time around  but it doesn't matter  because i'm running to be your president  to represent everybody  i'm not fighting to create democratic jobs or republican jobs  i'm fighting to create american jobs  i'm not fighting to improve schools in red states or blue states  i'm fighting to improve schools in the united states of america  the values of hard work and personal responsibility and looking out for one another  those values aren't worker values or business values or rich or poor values or   percent values or   percent values  they're american values  they belong to all of us  i still believe we are not as divided as our politics suggest  i still believe we've got more in common than the pundits tell us  i still believe in you  and if you keep on believing in me  i want you to register to vote by october   i want you to start voting next tuesday  october   and if you do  if you stand with me  if you're knocking on some doors with me and making some phone calls with me  we'll win portage county  we will win ohio  we will finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  thank you  ohio  god bless you  god bless america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  jim webb   i audience members   i four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  how's it going  virginia beach  it i laughter i   i audience members   i four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  it is good to be back  it is good to have all kinds of friends here today  i want to acknowledge a couple of people  first of all  outstanding congressman bobby scott  a good man who's running to join him in congress  paul hirschbiel  and i could not be prouder of a man who has served this country his entire life as a marine  as secretary of the navy  as an advocate for veterans  as a united states senator  somebody who is responsible for successfully passing the post  gi bill my friend and a true patriot  senator jim webb  and it's good to see all of you  now  unless you've been living under a rock or you didn't pay your cable bill i laughter i you may be aware that there's an election going on here in virginia  i was talking to my campaign manager  he was meeting with a young couple  they had a  year old son with them  sammy  and they're strong supporters  and so they were excited  they saw a picture of me on the wall  and they said   sammy  sammy  who's that  and the  year old says   that's barack obama  and then they said   and what does barack obama do  and sammy thought about it for a second  and then he said   he approves this message   i laughter i  he approves this message  there's a true story  so you know you're in campaign season  and i approve this message  and i've got to tell you  the reason is  in the coming weeks  you're going to have a very big choice to make  i mean  jim could not have been more eloquent about what's at stake  this is not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  it's a choice between two fundamentally different visions about how we move forward  two different ideas about our future  see  today  i believe that as a nation  we're moving forward again  we're not where we need to be  not yet  we've got a lot more folks who have to get back to work  we've got a lot more work to do to make the middle class secure again  but the question is  whose plan is better for you   i audience members   i yours   i the president i  no  well  i know some in the crowd may be a little biased  but i laughter i but i also want to speak to the audience who may be seeing this over the television  look  my opponent's a big believer in top down economics  he thinks that if you just spend another   trillion on tax cuts that favor the wealthiest americans  if you get rid of more regulations on wall street  that jobs and prosperity will rain down on everybody  the deficit will magically disappear  we'll live happily ever after  but there's a problem with this  we just tried this  we tried it in the last decade  before i was elected president  it didn't work then  and it won't work now  because top down economics doesn't work  we don't need to double down on the same trickle down policies that got us into this mess in the first place  this country doesn't succeed when only the rich get richer  we succeed when the middle class gets bigger  when there are ladders of opportunity for all who strive to get into the middle class  when everybody who's willing to work hard has a chance to get ahead and live up to their god given potential  i don't think we can get very far with leaders who write off half the nation as a bunch of victims who never take responsibility for their own lives  i know i travel around a lot in virginia and across this country  i don't meet a lot of victims  i see hard working virginians  i see students trying to work their way through college  i see single moms  like my mom  putting in overtime to raise their kids right  i see senior citizens who have been saving for retirement your entire lives  like jim webb said  i see a whole bunch of veterans who are served this country with bravery and distinction  and i see soldiers who defend our freedom every single day  and i see those military families who are wondering whether their loved ones are going to come back home  safe and sound  that's who i see  we don't believe anybody is entitled to success in this country  we don't believe government should help folks who aren't willing to try to help themselves  but we do believe in something called opportunity  we do believe in a country where hard work pays off  where responsibility is rewarded  where everyone gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules  we believe in an america where no matter what you look like  no matter who you are  no matter where you come from  no matter who you love  it you can make it if you try  that's the country i believe in  that's what i've been fighting for as president  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members   i four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  during campaign season  you always hear a lot about patriotism  well  you know what  it's time for a new economic patriotism  an economic patriotism rooted in the belief that growing our economy begins with a strong and thriving middle class  and i won't pretend that getting there is easy  the truth is  it's going to take a few more years to solve challenges that were building up over decades  but i want everybody here to understand our problems can be solved  our challenges will be met  we've got everything it takes to succeed  we've got the best workers in the world  we have the best entrepreneurs in the world  we've got the best researchers and scientists in the world  we've got the best colleges and universities in the world  i travel around the world  and i know there's not another country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states of america  so no matter how hard the path may seem sometimes  the path i'm offering leads to a better place  that's why i've put forward a practical plan to create jobs and grow the middle class  rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation  so what's my plan  just in case  you weren't watching the convention or maybe you just saw michelle  so i want to lay it out for you  number one  i want to export more products and i want to outsource fewer jobs  when my opponent said we should just  let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members   i boo   i the president i  don't boo  now  i want you to vote   i audience members   i vote  vote  vote   i the president i   i laughter i  but when governor romney turned his back on the american auto industry  i said i'm going to bet on american workers  i'm going to bet on american ingenuity  we came together  and we reinvented a dying auto industry that is now back on top of the world  in the last   years  we created more than half a million manufacturing jobs  so now  you've got a choice  virginia  you can follow governor romney's advice and keep   i audience members   i boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  we can give we can keep giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas  or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and hire new workers and create new jobs right here in virginia  right here in the united states of america  we can help big factories and small businesses double their exports  we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next   years  you can make that happen with your vote  second  i want to control more of our own energy  after   years of doing nothing  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your car will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  we've doubled the amount of renewable energy that we generate from things like wind and solar  thousands of americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long lasting batteries  today  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades  so now you've got a choice  governor romney wants to reverse this progress   i audience members   i no   i the president i  or we can build on that progress  see  unlike my opponent  i'm not going to let the oil companies write this country's energy plan  i'm not going to see them collect another   billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers  we've got a better plan where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal technology and where farmers and scientists are harnessing new biofuels to power our cars and trucks and where we put construction workers back to work refitting homes and factories so they're more energy efficient  where we're developing a hundred year supply of natural gas  where we cut our oil imports in half by   and create hundreds of thousands of jobs all across this nation  that's the plan that will move us forward  that's why i'm running for a second term  number three  i want to give more americans the chance to learn the skills they need to compete  and i want us to have the best education system on earth  i am only standing here because of a great education  i wasn't born into wealth or privilege  but i got a great education because i was born here in the united states of america  education was the gateway of opportunity for michelle  it was the gateway of opportunity for a whole lot of you  it's now the gateway to a middle class life  and so we have not just talked the talk  we've walked the walk when it comes to education  millions of students are now right now paying less because we took on a system that was wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders  and we said let's give that money directly to students  let's keep interest rates on student loans low  let's make sure that we are implementing the post  gi bill so everybody has got a fair shot  so now you've got a choice we could gut education to pay for more tax breaks for the wealthy   i audience members   i boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members   i vote   i the president i  vote  or we can decide that in the united states of america  no child should have her dream deferred just because of an overcrowded classroom  no family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money  no company should have to relocate to china because they couldn't find the workers they need right here in the united states of america  so  virginia  i'm asking you to help me recruit   new math and science teachers  and improve early childhood education  help give   million workers the chance to learn skills at a community college for a job that is hiring right now  help us keep tuition costs down for young people all across this country  they deserve opportunity just like i got opportunity  just like you got opportunity  that's what we're fighting for  that's why i'm running for a second term  we can meet these goals  you can choose this future for america  number four  i want to cut the deficit without sticking it to the middle class  i put forward a very specific plan to reduce the deficit by   trillion  i've already worked with republicans in this congress to cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending  and i'm willing to do more  i want to reform the tax code so it's simple and fair  but i also want to make sure that the wealthiest households in america pay modestly higher taxes on incomes over   which is the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  our economy created nearly   million new jobs  we went from deficit to surplus  and we produced a whole lot of millionaires to boot  now  the reason is  years ago  i said i'd cut taxes for middle class families  and i did  the typical family has seen their tax burden go down about   on the federal level because of our policy  and i want to keep your taxes low because you need it  what happens when middle class families have a little extra money   i audience member   i spend it   i the president i  they spend it  maybe you got to finally trade in that  year old car and get a new one  maybe you need to buy a computer for your kid who's going off to college  and what happens is when the middle class or folks fighting to get into the middle class  when they've got a little extra money  they spend it  and now suddenly  business has more customers  which means they have more profits  which means they're doing better so they hire more workers  and you get a virtuous cycle going up  everybody does better  that's how you grow an economy  not from the top down but from the middle out  now  in fairness  my opponent also has a plan  but as president clinton pointed out down in charlotte  there's one thing missing from it  arithmetic   i laughter i  arithmetic  my opponent somehow says we can lower our deficit while spending trillions of dollars more on new tax breaks for the wealthy  and it doesn't add up  every few days  he keeps on saying he's going to  reboot  this campaign and they're going to start explaining very specifically how this plan is going to work  and then they don't  they don't say how you'd pay for   trillion in tax cuts that are skewed towards the wealthy without raising taxes on middle class families  they don't explain how you'd spend   trillion more on military spending that our military hasn't asked for without having you foot the bill  the math doesn't add up  my opponent thinks it's fair that somebody who makes   million a year  like him  pays a lower tax rate than a cop or a teacher who makes    i audience members   i boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members   i vote   i the president i  vote  look  i just disagree  i don't think that's fair  and i don't think it helps grow our economy  and i refuse to ask middle class families to give up your deduction for owning a home or raising kids just so we pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i refuse to ask the college students who are here to pay more or kick kids off of head start or eliminate health insurance for millions of poor and elderly and disabled just to pay for a tax cut for me  that is not right  that's not who we are  and i will never  ever turn medicare into a voucher  because no american should have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  they worked all their lives  they should be able to retire with dignity  we'll reform and strengthen medicare for the long haul  but we'll do it by reducing the cost of health care  not by dumping those costs onto seniors  just like we're going to keep the promise of social security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it  and that means we're not by turning it over to wall street  now  virginia  our prosperity at home is linked to our policies abroad  four years ago  i said i'd end the war in iraq  and we did  i said we'd wind down the war in afghanistan in a responsible way  and we are  you've got a new tower across the new york skyline  al qaida is on the path to defeat  bin laden is dead  but we still face serious threats  as we saw just a couple of weeks ago with the tragic death of our ambassador and three of his colleagues  and that's why  as long as i'm commander in chief  virginia  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  and as jim webb so eloquently stated  when our troops take off their uniforms  we will serve them as well as they've served us  because nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  now  my opponent seems to have different views  he said it was  tragic  to end the war in iraq  he won't tell us how or what he'd do in afghanistan  i have  and i will  and i will use the money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways  because after a decade of war  it is time to do some nation building right here at home  so that's the choice we now face   i audience member   i we love you   i the president i  love you back  but that's what this election comes down to  the other side  they keep on running these ads  and their basic message is  is that somehow bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations is the only way  that because government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  their theory is  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  their theory is  if you can't afford to go to college  borrow money from your parents  you know what  we've got a different idea  we're fighting on behalf of a different idea  we don't think that anybody owes us anything  and we don't think government can solve all our problems  but we do think that the government can help  that it's not the source of all our problems  we don't believe in a politics that tries to separate people out  whether it's corporations or unions or welfare recipients or immigrants or gays or  here in america  we believe that we're in this all together  we believe america only works when we accept certain responsibilities for ourselves  but also for others and for future generations  to create more opportunity and more possibility for this nation  we understand america is not what can be for us  but what can be done by us  together  as one nation and as one people  and you understood that   years ago  that's what i took away from   the election   years ago wasn't about me  it was about you and your capacity to move this country forward  you're the reason a mother in richmond doesn't have to worry about her son being denied medical coverage because of a preexisting condition  you made that happen  you're the reason a middle class family in leesburg got a tax cut  money they can use to buy groceries  put gas in the car  pay their bills  that was because of you  you're the reason a student in charlottesville or blacksburg or hampton has help to pay for her college education  the reason a returning veteran like jim's son can go to college on the new gi bill  that's because of you  you're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported to from the only country she's ever known  the country she calls home  you're the reason why we ended  don't ask  don't tell  you're the reason that thousands of families have finally been able to say to the loved ones who served us so bravely   welcome home  you know it's funny  i made this point in florida  i said one of the things i learned after   years  it reminded me that change doesn't come from the inside  you got to change washington from the outside  you change it with the help of ordinary americans who are willing to have their voices heard  and for some reason  this got governor romney really excited  and he rewrote his speech  and he stood up at a rally  and he proudly declared  i'll get the job done from the inside  which got me thinking  what kind of inside job are you talking about   i laughter i  because if it's the inside job of rubberstamping the top down  lobbyist driven agenda of this republican congress  we don't want that   i audience members   i no   i the president i  if it's the inside job of letting oil companies write energy policy  insurance companies writing health care policy  outsourcers writing our tax code  we don't need that   i audience members   i no   i the president i  if it's the inside job of trying to control the health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making themselves  we'll take a pass on that  we don't need an inside job  we want change in washington  and i've always said that change takes more than one term or one president  it takes more than one party  it can't happen if you write off half the nation before you take office  in     percent of this country did not vote for me  but the night of the election  i said to all those americans  i said  i may not have won your vote  but i hear your voice  i need your help  i will be your president too  and so i say this to virginia  i don't know how many of you out there will be voting for me  but i'll be fighting for you no matter what  i'm not fighting to create democratic jobs or republican jobs  i'm fighting to create american jobs  i'm not fighting to improve schools in blue states or red states  i'm fighting to improve schools in the united states  the values of hard work and personal responsibility and looking after your neighbor  those aren't just values of rich folks or poor folks or the   percent or the   percent  they are american values  and they belong to all of us  and if we reclaim those values now  if we rally around a new economic patriotism together  we can rebuild this economy together  we will grow the middle class together  we will move forward together   i audience members   i yes   i the president i  i don't believe we're as divided as our politics make it seem  i think we've got more in common than the pundits give us credit for  i still believe in you  and if you still believe in me  i'm asking for your vote  if you stand with me and work with me  we'll win the tidewater again  we'll win virginia again  we'll finish what we started and remind the world why the united states is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  virginia  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  las vegas  oh  what a beautiful evening  a spectacular evening  this is why i like coming to vegas  good weather and good people  now  first of all  before i get started  can everybody please give chasstiry a big round of applause for the great introduction  i want to thank desert pines high school go jaguars for hosting us  give it up for mana  i hear they played an outstanding set earlier  it's good to be back with your once and next congresswoman  dina titus is here  and it's good to see my national campaign cochair who also happens to be one of the counselors here at desert pines  loretta harper is in the house  and it's good to see all of you  i hope you're having a good time   i audience members i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  now  you may have heard that in a few days my opponent in this election and i are going to have a debate  i'm looking forward to it  i know folks in the media are speculating already on who's going to have the best zingers   i audience member i  you are   i the president i  i don't know about that  who's going to put the most points on the board   i audience members i  you are   i the president i  no  no  governor romney  he's a good debater  i'm just okay  but what i'm most concerned about is having a serious discussion about what we need to do to keep the country growing and restore security for hard working americans  that's what people are going to be listening for  that's the debate that you deserve  because in the coming weeks  you're going to have a big choice to make  nevada  and it's not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties  it's a choice between two different paths for this country  it's a choice between two fundamentally different visions for our nation  see  i believe that as a nation  we're moving forward again  we're not where we need to be yet  we've got a lot more work to do here in nevada and all across the country to make the middle class secure again  to give ladders of opportunity for folks who are fighting to get into the middle class  but the question is  whose plan is better for you  now  my   i audience members i  obama  obama  obama   i the president i  my opponent is a big believer in top down economics  he thinks that if we just spend another   trillion on tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  if we get rid of regulations on wall street  then all our problems will be solved  and jobs and prosperity will trickle down on all of you  and the deficit will disappear  and we'll live happily ever after  there's only problem one problem with that  we just tried that in the decade before i became president  it didn't work  top down economics never works  we don't need to double down on the same trickle down policies that got us into this mess in the first place  we don't need policies that just help folks at the very top  that's not how the country grows  that's not how we succeed  we succeed when the middle class is getting bigger  when more people have the chance to get ahead and live up to their god given potential  we don't get very far when we've got leaders who write off half the nation as a bunch of victims who don't take responsibility for their lives  let me tell you  i've been to nevada a lot  you guys may get tired of me   i audience members i  no   i the president i  but as i travel around the state  i don't see a lot of victims  i see a lot of hard working nevadans  i see students trying to work their way through school  i see single moms trying to put in overtime to raise their kids  i see senior citizens who've saved all their lives because they've worked all their lives to earn their retirement  i see veterans who've served this country bravely  i see soldiers who defend our freedom today  we don't believe that anybody is entitled to success  we don't believe government should help people who aren't trying to help themselves  but we do believe in something called opportunity  we believe that hard work should pay off in this country  that responsibility should be rewarded in this country  that this is a country where everybody should get a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules  we believe in an america where no matter what you look like or where you come from  what your last name is  who you love  that you can make it if you try  that's the country i believe in  that's what i've been fighting for  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  see  what i want to promote is a new economic patriotism  one that's rooted in the belief that we grow the economy best when everybody has got a shot and the middle class is thriving  and i won't pretend that it's going to be easy to get there  it took us a bunch of years to get us into this mess  it's going to take a few more to get us out  but i want everybody to know that our challenges can be solved  our problems can be met  we've still got the best workers in the world and the best entrepreneurs and the best scientists  the best businesses  the best colleges  the best universities  there isn't a country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states  and you know what  the path i'm offering may be harder  but it leads to a better place  so i've put forward a specific  practical plan to create jobs and grow the middle class and rebuild our economy on a stronger foundation  so i want you to know what this plan is so when you talk to folks you can say  well  here's what he's going to do  first  i want to export more products  but i want to outsource fewer jobs  you remember when the auto industry was about to go under  my opponent said  let's  let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  i said  let's come together and reinvent a dying auto industry  and now it's back on top of the world  we've created more than half a million new manufacturing jobs  so now you've got a choice  we can keep giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  or we can reward companies that are opening new plants and hiring new workers right here in nevada  that's what i want to do  i want to help big factories and small businesses export more  we can create a million new manufacturing jobs  but you're going to have to vote to make it happen  i want us to control more of our own energy  that's the second part of our plan  after   years of doing nothing  we raised fuel standards so by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that will save you money  and it will be good for our economy  and it's good for our national security  and it's good for our environment  we've doubled the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar right here in nevada and all across the country  thousands of americans have jobs building wind turbines and solar panels and long lasting batteries  today  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades  so now you've got a choice  we could reverse this progress  like governor romney wants to do   i audience members i  no   i the president i  or we can build on it  see  unlike my opponent  i'm not going to let the oil companies write our energy plan  i'm not going to let oil companies collect   billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers  we've got a better plan  where we invest in wind and solar and farmers and scientists who are harnessing new biofuels to power our cars and where construction workers are building homes and factories that waste less energy and we're investing to get out a hundred year supply of natural gas  we can create hundreds of thousands of jobs here in nevada and all across the country and cut our oil imports in half by   that's my plan  but you've got to vote if we're going to make it happen  i want to give more americans the chance to get a great education and get the skills they need to compete  that's the third part of my plan  education is the only reason i'm standing here today  son of a single mom  it's the only reason michelle got a chance  and so now the question is  are we going to give that opportunity to everybody  right now there are millions of students who are paying less for college because we took away billions of dollars that were going to banks and we said let's give them directly to students  so now you've got a choice  we can gut our investments in education  like governor romney wants to do  to pay for more tax breaks for the wealthy   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  or we can decide  here in nevada and here in the united states of america  no child should have her dream deferred because of an overcrowded classroom  no family should set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money  no company should have to look in some other country because they can't find the workers they need with the right skills here at home  so  nevada  i need you to help me recruit   new math and science teachers  improve our early education system  create   million more slots in the community colleges so workers can get trained for the new jobs that are out there right now  help us work with colleges and universities to keep tuition down  that's a goal we can meet together  you can choose that future for america  but if we're going to do that  what do you need to do   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  you're going to need to vote  number four  i want to reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class and working class families  my plan would do just that  and i've already worked with republicans and democrats to cut spending by a trillion dollars  i'm willing to do a little bit more  i want to reform our tax code so it's simple and it's fair  but i also want to ask the wealthiest households in america to pay slightly higher taxes over incomes of   that's the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  we created   million new jobs  the biggest surplus in history  and a whole lot of millionaires to boot  so that's my plan  and in fairness  my opponent has got a plan too  that's only one problem  some of you heard bill clinton say there's no arithmetic in it   i laughter i  they think that somehow you can lower our deficits by spending another   trillion on new breaks for the wealthy  but no matter how many times they try to  reboot  their campaign and try to explain it  they can't  they can't explain how you spend   trillion on tax cuts for the wealthy without raising taxes on middle class families  how do you spend   trillion on new military spending that our military hasn't asked for and cut our deficit  you can't do it  the math doesn't add up  governor romney said he thought it was fair for somebody making   million a year  like him  to pay a lower tax rate than a cop or a teacher or somebody working over at one of the casinos who's making   now  i don't think that's fair   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i don't think that's how we grow our economy   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i refuse to ask middle class families to give up the deductions they have for owning a home or raising their kids just so me or governor romney get a tax break  i don't want to ask students to pay more for college or kick kids out of head start or eliminate health insurance for millions of poor or elderly or disabled americans just so millionaires and billionaires can get a tax cut  we can't afford it  i don't think the answer for all the hard working folks here in nevada and across the country whose homes are underwater is just to do nothing and wait it out  that was governor romney's advice  just let the whole housing market bottom out  well  you know what  my administration  we have already helped more than a million responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages  i'm running to let them get i'm running to make sure that everybody  more people like them who are responsible  who have been paying and making their mortgage payments  that they have a chance to refinance and save up to   a year  and by the way  i'm never going to turn medicare into a voucher program  we're not going to do that either  if you've been working all your life and now you're about to retire  you shouldn't have to spend your golden years at the mercy of an insurance company  we're going to reform and strengthen medicare for the long haul the right way by reducing the cost of health care  not by shifting it onto seniors  and we're not going to we are going to keep the promise of social security  we're not going to turn it over to wall street  and just like we're doing work here at home  we're going to continue to do work abroad  four years ago  i said i'd end the war in iraq  i did  i said we're going to wind down the war in afghanistan  we are  and while a twin tower new tower rises above the new york skyline  al qaida is on the path to defeat  and osama bin laden is dead   i audience members i  u s a  u s a  u s a   i the president i  now  as we saw a couple of weeks ago  we still face serious threats around the world  and that's why  so long as i'm commander in chief  we will make sure we always have the strongest military the world has ever known  but you know the thing that makes our military strongest is the amazing men and women in uniform  so when they take off that uniform  when they come home  we've got to serve them as well as they've served us  because nobody who fought for us should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads or the care they deserve  when they come home  nobody  governor romney has got a different set of ideas  he thinks the way i ended the war in iraq is  tragic  he won't tell us how he'll end the war in afghanistan  we don't know  i have  and i will  and i'm going to use the money we're no longer spending on war to do some nation building here at home  rebuilding our roads and our bridges and putting americans back to work  that's part of what makes america strong  that's what we're going to do  so this is the choice we face in this election  this is what the election comes down to  and you are going to hear over the next   months i know you must be tired of hearing ads but you're going to hear more over the next  or the next   weeks  and over and over again  you're going to hear my opponents talk about how bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations  that's the way to go  and since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  their basic theory is  if you can't afford health care  then hope you don't get sick  if you can't afford college  borrow money from your parents   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  you know what  that's not who we are  i don't think government can solve all our problems  but government is not the source of all our problems either  there are some things we've got to do together  instead of going around blaming somebody unions or immigrants or gays or somebody for what's going on  what we need to do is pull together  we're all in this together  we believe that america only works when we all accept responsibility for ourselves and for each other  that's how we create more opportunity  more possibility  america is not about what can be done for you  it's about what can be done by us together  as one nation and one people  and that's what you understood back in   you're the reason seniors across nevada are averaging nearly   less on their medicines because of health care reform  you did that  you're the reason that students thousands of students at unlv and schools across this state have more help paying for college  you made that happen  you're the reason why two grandparents in reno could refinance their mortgage and keep their piece of the american dream  you're the reason why a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home  you're the reason why an outstanding soldier won't be kicked out of the military just because of who he loved  you're the reason why thousands of families have been able to say to the loved ones who served us so bravely   welcome home   i applause i  welcome home  welcome home  you made that happen  i made this point down in florida the other day  and governor romney heard me say you can't make change just from washington  and somehow  he got all excited about this  he changed his speech  he said  i'm going to make change from the inside  and it got me thinking  well  what kind of inside job is he talking about   i laughter i  is he talking about the inside job where outsourcers are writing the tax code  is he talking about the inside job where oil companies are writing the energy plan and health insurance companies are writing the insurance plans  is he talking about the inside job where a bunch of men in washington decide women can't make their own health care decisions  because if that's the inside job he's talking about  we don't want it  we don't need it  change is only going to happen when ordinary americans  working together with their elected representatives  make all our voices heard  that's how change happens  so the question then is  how hard are you willing to work for it   i audience members i  hard   i the president i  how hard are you willing to work for it   i audience members i  hard   i the president i  we've got just a few more weeks left  and in   when i won    percent of the people didn't vote for me  they voted for john mccain  and that's the way democracy works  and i said on election night  i said to the people who didn't vote for me  especially  i said  i may not have won your vote  but i heard your voice  i need your help  and i'm going to fight for you too  i'm going to work on your behalf too  because i'm not interested in creating democratic jobs or republican jobs  i'm interested in creating american jobs  i don't want to improve schools in the blue states or red states  i want to improve schools in the united states of america  i'm not just fighting for values that are worker values or business values or rich people's values or poor people's values or black or white or hispanic or asian or native america or abled or not disabled i'm fighting for american values  and those values of hard work and individual responsibility  but also looking out for one another  those are values that we all share  those are values that belong to all of us  and now we've got to reclaim them  if you are willing to work hard  harder than you did   years ago  if you're willing to knock on some doors and make some phone calls  we can reclaim those values  we can rally around a new economic patriotism  we can rebuild this economy  we can strengthen the middle class  we can keep moving forward  we're not going backwards  we're not as divided as our politics suggest  i still believe we've got more in common than anybody understands  i believe in you  and i ask you to keep on believing in me  i'm asking for your vote  i'm asking you to stand with me  and if you stand with me and work with me  we will win clark county again  we'll win nevada again  we'll win this election again  we'll finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  madison  go badgers  first of all  i've got to just point out that some members of the badgers basketball team are here  they're getting ready for the season coming up  they've invited me to play  so i said  after the election  i will be raining down jumpers on them   i laughter i  actually  i didn't say that  i said i'm getting kind of old so   i laughter i  can everybody please give katie an unbelievable round of applause for that great introduction  we've got one of the finest men i know  as well as a great united states senator  herb kohl here  your next united states senator  tammy baldwin  your next congressman  mark pocan  your mayor  paul soglin  and we've got a whole bunch of other folks here  this is an unbelievable crowd  i've been told this is good practice for halloween on state street  but there's something that you've got to do before then  madison  you've got to vote  in just   days  on october   wisconsin gets to start voting early  so you can register and vote at your early vote location  and if you need to find out where it is  go to vote barackobama com  find out where  when  how to vote  now  some of you may have heard  last night we had our first debate  and i just flew in from denver  and i was telling folks there  when i got on the stage  i met this very spirited fellow who claimed to be mitt romney   i laughter i  but i know it couldn't have been mitt romney because the real mitt romney has been running around the country for the last year promising   trillion in tax cuts that favor the wealthy  and yet  the fellow on the stage last night  who looked like mitt romney  said he did not know anything about that  it was all news to him   i laughter i  the real mitt romney said that we don't need any more teachers in the classroom   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  but the fellow on stage last night  he said he loves teachers  can't get enough of them   i laughter i  the mitt romney we all know invested in companies that were called  pioneers  of outsourcing jobs to other countries  but the guy on stage last night  he said he'd never heard of tax breaks for companies that shift jobs overseas never heard of them   i laughter i  and he said  if that's true  he must need a new accountant  so now we know for sure that wasn't the real mitt romney  because the real mitt romney is doing just fine with the accountant that he already has   i laughter i  whoever it was that was on stage last night doesn't want to be held accountable for what the real mitt romney has been saying for the last year  and that's because he knows full well that we don't want what he's been selling over the last year  governor romney may dance around his positions  he may do a tapdance and a two step  but if you want to be president  then you owe the american people the truth  so here's the truth  governor romney cannot pay for his   trillion tax plan without blowing up the deficit or sticking it to the middle class  we can't afford to go down that road again  we can't afford another round of budget busting tax cuts for the wealthy  we can't afford to gut our investments in education or clean energy or research or technology  we can't afford to roll back regulations on wall street banks or oil companies or insurance companies  we can't afford to double down on the same top down economic policies that got us into this mess  that is not a jobs plan  it's not a plan for our economy  it's not a plan to strengthen the middle class  it is not change  it is a relapse  and we're not going to do it  we have been there  we have tried that  we are not going back  we're moving forward  because i've got a different view we have a different view about how to create jobs and prosperity  this country doesn't succeed when only the rich get richer  we succeed when everybody has a shot  when the middle class is getting bigger  when there are ladders of opportunity into the middle class  our economy does not grow from the top down  it grows from the middle out  that's how it grows  we don't believe that anybody is entitled to success in this country  but we do believe in opportunity  we do believe in a country where hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded  where everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules  that's the country we believe in  that's what i've been fighting for  for the last   years  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  madison  what we are rallying around is a new economic patriotism that is rooted in the core belief that built this country  the belief that the economy grows when we have a strong and thriving middle class and everybody who works hard has a shot  and there are specific ways that we can do that  i want to export more products and outsource fewer jobs  my opponent said we should let detroit go bankrupt  we came together   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president   i vote  we came together to reinvent a dying auto industry that's now back on top of the world  we've created half a million new manufacturing jobs  and so we can keep giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  or we can start rewarding companies that are opening new plants and training new workers right here in wisconsin  right here in the united states of america  that's what we need to do  i want to help big factories and small businesses double their exports  create a million new manufacturing jobs  you can make that happen  but you're going to have to vote  i want to control more of our own energy  after   years of doing nothing  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that's good for your pocketbook  that's good for our economy  and it's also good for our environment  we've doubled the amount of renewable energy that we generate from sources like wind and solar  thousands of americans have jobs today building wind turbines  long lasting batteries  today  the united states of america is less dependent on oil than at any time in nearly two decades  so now you've got a choice between a plan that reverses this progress  as you heard last night  or one that builds on it  the guy who was playing mitt romney said he refuses to close a loophole that gives big oil companies   billion in taxpayer subsidies every single year  does anybody think that oil companies need a tax subsidy right now   i audience members i  no   i the president i  so we've got a better plan  we're going to keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal  and farmers and scientists can harness biofuels to power our cars and our trucks and make our buildings and schools more energy efficient and develop our natural gas that's right beneath our feet  and if we do all those things  we can cut our oil imports in half by   we can support hundreds of thousands of jobs all across the country  but you're going to have to vote to make it happen  i want to make sure that every young person in america has the chance to get the skills  the knowledge they need  to compete in this  st century economy  education is the only reason i'm standing on this stage  it's the only reason michelle was able to do what she did  and so we haven't forgotten that we needed some student loans to get through school  that's why over the last   years  we've helped millions of students pay less for college because we finally took on a system that was wasting billions of dollars on banks and lenders  we said  let's cut out the middleman  let's give the money directly to students  now  the guy playing mitt romney last night says he loves education  but the budget that his running mate  congressman ryan  put forward   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president  v i ote  would gut education to pay for more tax breaks for the wealthy  that's one path  it's the wrong path  we need to decide that in the united states of america  no child should have her dream deferred because of an overcrowded classroom  because of outdated textbooks  no family should have to set aside an acceptance letter to go to the university of wisconsin because they don't have the money  no company should have to look for workers in china because they couldn't find any with the right skills here in the united states  so i need you to help me recruit   new math and science teachers  improve early childhood education  give   million workers the chance to learn skills at the community college that will lead directly to a job  help us work with colleges and universities like this one to cut the growth of tuition costs so that you guys aren't overburdened with debt when you graduate  that's a goal we can meet  we can choose that future for america  we're going to have to do something about the deficit  but we've got to do it in a smart way  i said i'd cut the deficit by   trillion through a mix of spending cuts and higher taxes on the wealthiest of americans  i've already worked with republicans to cut a trillion dollars in spending  i'm willing to do more  i want to reform the tax code so it's simple and it's fair  but i'm also going to ask the wealthiest among us to pay higher taxes on incomes over   the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  created   million new jobs  went from deficit to surplus  and look  the whole economy does well when taxes are kept low for middle class families and working families  because when you guys have a little extra money in your pocket  you spend it  you have to  on basic necessities  and that means business has more customers and they make more profits  they then hire more workers  and the economy as a whole begins to grow  but to do that and reduce the deficit at the same time  we've got to ask folks who can afford it to do a little bit more  now  last night  this may have actually been the real mitt romney  because he ruled out raising a dime on taxes on anyone ever  no matter how much money they make  ruled out closing those loopholes that are giving   billion of corporate welfare to the oil companies  refused to even acknowledge the loophole that gives tax breaks to corporations that move jobs overseas  when he was asked what he would do to actually cut spending and reduce the deficit  he said he'd eliminate public television funding   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  so don't boo  now   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  but i just want to make sure i got this straight  he'll get rid of regulations on wall street  but he's going to crack down on sesame street  thank goodness somebody is finally cracking down on big bird  who knew that he was responsible for all these deficits  elmo has got to watch out   i laughter i  the fact is the guy playing mitt romney last night  his math doesn't add up  the only way to pay for   trillion in new tax cuts and   trillion in new defense spending that the military is not asking for is by either blowing up the deficit or asking you to pay more  and i refuse to do that  i'm not going to ask middle class families to give up their deduction for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children out of head start programs or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans to pay for a tax cut we can't afford  and i will not turn medicare into a voucher  i explained why yesterday  governor romney doubled down on this proposal last night  and he is wrong  no american should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  they should retire with dignity and the care that they've earned  so we can reform medicare the right way by reducing health care costs  not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more  and we will keep the promise of social security  strengthen it  but we won't turn it over to wall street  now  madison  we talked a lot about domestic affairs yesterday  but we're going to have a chance to talk about what's happening abroad as well  four years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  and i did  i said we'd wind down the war in afghanistan in a responsible way  and we are  and because we were able to refocus attention  al qaida is on the path to defeat and usama bin laden is dead  now  there's still a lot of threats out there  we saw that just  tragically  in the last couple of weeks  and that's why  so long as i'm commander in chief  we'll sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  and when our troops take off the uniform  we'll serve them as well as they've served us  nobody should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they have fought for america's freedom  we will honor that commitment  now  i don't know who's going to show up at the next debate  but i do know that the real mitt romney said it was  tragic  to end the war in iraq  he won't tell us how he'd end the war in afghanistan  i have  and i will  and i'm going to use the money that we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and to put more people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways  after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building here at home  that's why i'm running for a second term  so this is the choice we face  this is what the election comes down to  the other side will tell you that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if a company is releasing pollution into the air that your children breathe  well  that's the price of progress  if you can't afford to start a business or go to college  borrow money from your parents  you know  that's not what this country is about  that's not how our greatness was built  here in america  we believe we're all in this together  we understand it's not about what can be done for us  it's about what can be done by us  together  as one nation and as one people  that's what we believe  you're the reason the mother in green bay doesn't have to worry about her son being denied medical coverage because of a preexisting condition  you made that happen  you're the reason a middle class family in milwaukee got a tax cut  money they can use to buy groceries and put gas in the car and pay their bills  you did that  you're the reason that a student right here at the university of wisconsin is getting more help paying her college education or a veteran can go to this school on the new gi bill  you made that happen  you made that happen  you're the reason a young immigrant  who went to school here  grew up here  pledged allegiance to our flag  will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home  you're the reason an outstanding soldier won't be kicked out of the military just because of who he loves  and you're the reason thousands of families have finally been able to say to loved ones who served us so bravely   welcome home  welcome home  welcome home  and  madison  that's why you can't buy into the cynicism that is so prevalent  the idea that the change we fought for somehow isn't possible  because when that happens  change doesn't happen  if you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference  then other people fill the void  the well connected  the lobbyists  the folks who can write   million checks to try to buy this election or the ones who are trying to make it harder to vote  washington politicians who want to control health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making themselves  you can't let that happen  you've got to move us forward  i've always said change doesn't happen in one year or one term or even one president  it doesn't happen with one political party  change happens because everybody gets involved and says it's going to happen  it certainly can't happen if you're someone who wants to lead the nation  but writes off half the nation before you even take office  in     percent of the american people did not vote for me  they voted for john mccain  but on the night of the election  i said to those americans  i may not have won your vote  but i hear your voices  i need your help  i will be your president  too  and i don't know how many folks will vote for me this time  but i want you to know  i'll be with you no matter what  because i'm not fighting to create democratic jobs or republican jobs  i'm fighting to create american jobs  i'm not fighting to improve schools in red states or blue states  i'm fighting to improve schools in the united states  i'm not fighting on behalf of values that are rich or poor or business or worker  i'm fighting for those american values of hard work and looking out for one another  and they belong to all of us  and if we rally around those values  if we have a genuine sense of patriotism about how we build an economy where everybody is getting a fair shot  then we're going to strengthen the middle class  and we're going to keep moving forward  and i believe that our politics is not as divided as it seems sometimes  i still believe in the american people  they are what gives me strength every single day  they are what gets me up in the morning  and they're what i'm thinking about when i go to bed at night  i believe in you  i'm asking you to keep believing in me  i'm asking for your vote  and if you stand with me and work with me  we will win madison again  we'll win wisconsin again  we will win the election again  we'll finish what we started in   and remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  madison  god bless you  wisconsin  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  colorado  it is good to be back in denver  can everybody please give lily a big round of applause for the great introduction  we've got so many dignitaries  i can't name them all  but we've got your outstanding senators in the house  your terrific members of congress are here  got our campaign cochairs  got will i am  most importantly  we've got all of you  even though you had to get the winter coats out a little quicker than you expected   i laughter i   i audience member i  we love you  obama   i the president i   i laughter i  i love you back  now  the reason i was in denver obviously is to see all of you  and i just and it's always pretty   i laughter i  but we also had our first debate last night  and when i got onto the stage  i met this very spirited fellow who claimed to be mitt romney   i laughter i  but it couldn't have been mitt romney  because the real mitt romney has been running around the country for the last year promising   trillion in tax cuts that favor the wealthy  the fellow on stage last night said he didn't know anything about that   i laughter i  the real mitt romney said we don't need any more teachers in our classrooms  but   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote   i laughter i  but the fellow on stage last night  he loves teachers  can't get enough of them   i laughter i  the mitt romney we all know invested in companies that were called  pioneers  of outsourcing jobs to other countries  but the guy on stage last night  he said that he doesn't even know that there are such laws that encourage outsourcing  he's never heard of them  never heard of them  never heard of tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas  he said that if it's true  he must need a new accountant   i laughter i  now  we know for sure it was not the real mitt romney  because he seems to be doing just fine with his current accountant   i laughter i  so you see  the man on stage last night  he does not want to be held accountable for the real mitt romney's decisions and what he's been saying for the last year  and that's because he knows full well that we don't want what he's been selling for the last year  so governor romney may dance around his positions  but if you want to be president  you owe the american people the truth  so here's the truth  governor romney cannot pay for his   trillion tax plan without blowing up the deficit or sticking it to the middle class  that's the math  we can't afford to go down that road again  we can't afford another round of budget busting tax cuts for the wealthy  we can't afford to gut our investments in education or clean energy or research and technology  we can't afford to roll back regulations on wall street or on big oil companies or insurance companies  we cannot afford to double down on the same top down economic policies that got us into this mess  that is not a plan to create jobs  that is not a plan to grow the economy  that is not change  that is a relapse  we don't want to go back there  we've tried it  it didn't work  and we are not going back  we are going forward  now  i've got a different view about how we create jobs and prosperity  this country doesn't succeed when we only see the rich getting richer  we succeed when the middle class gets bigger  we grow our economy not from the top down  but from the middle out  we don't believe that anybody is entitled to success in this country  but we do believe in something called opportunity  we believe in a country where hard work pays off and where responsibility is rewarded and everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules  that's the country we believe in  that's what i'm fighting for  that's why i'm running for a second term for president of the united states  and that's why i want your vote   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  what i talked about last night was a new economic patriotism  a patriotism that's rooted in the belief that growing our economy begins with a strong  thriving middle class  that means we export more jobs and we outsource export more products and we outsource fewer jobs  over the last   years  we came together to reinvent a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world  we've created more than half a million new manufacturing jobs  and so now you've got a choice  we can keeping giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas  or we can start rewarding companies that are opening new plants and training new workers  and creating new jobs right here in the united states of america  that's what we're looking for  we can help big factories and small businesses double their exports and create a million new manufacturing jobs over the next   years  you can make that happen  i want to control more of our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will be going twice as far on a gallon of gas  we've doubled the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar  and thousands of americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long lasting batteries  the united states of america today is less dependent on foreign oil than any time in nearly two decades  so now you've got a choice between a plan that reverses this progress or one that builds on it  last night my opponent says he refuses to close the loophole that gives big oil companies   billion in taxpayer subsidies every year  now  we've got a better plan  where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal  and the good jobs that come with them  where farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and our trucks  where construction workers are retrofitting homes and factories so they waste less energy  and we can develop a hundred year supply of natural gas that creates hundreds of thousands of jobs  and by the way  we can cut our oil imports in half by   that will be good for our economy  that will be good for our environment  that will be good for colorado  that will be good for america  that's what we're fighting for  that's why i am running for a second term as president of the united states  i want to give more americans the chance to learn the skills they need to compete  i talked last night about how education was the gateway of opportunity for me and michelle  for so many of you  it's the gateway for a middle class life  and today  millions of students are paying less for college because we took on a system that was wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on bankers and lenders  and so now you've got a choice  we can gut education to pay for more tax breaks for the wealthy  or we can decide that in the united states of america  no child should have her dream deferred because of an overcrowded classroom  no family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money  no company should have to look for workers in china because they couldn't find any with the right skills here in the united states  so we're going to recruit   new math and science teachers  and we're going to improve early childhood education  and we're going to create   million more slots in community colleges so that workers can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now  and we are going to continue to do everything we need to do to cut the growth of tuition costs because every young person in america should have the opportunity to go to college without being loaded up with hundreds with tens of thousands of dollars' worth of debt  that's part of what it means for us to be able to build an economy that lasts  and finally  i've got a balanced plan that independent experts say will cut the deficit by   trillion through a mix of spending cuts and higher taxes on wealthiest americans  now  i've already worked with republicans in congress to cut a trillion dollars in spending  and i'm willing to do more  i want to reform the tax code so that it's simple and it's fair  but also so incomes over   we go back to the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  we created   million new jobs  the biggest surplus in history  a lot of millionaires to boot  now  last night  governor romney ruled out raising a dime of taxes on anybody ever  no matter how much money they make  he ruled out closing the loophole that gives oil companies   billion in corporate welfare  he refused to even acknowledge the loophole that gives tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas  and when he was asked what he'd actually do to cut the deficit and reduce spending  he said he'd eliminate funding for public television   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  that was his answer  i mean  thank goodness somebody is finally getting tough on big bird   i laughter i  it's about time  we didn't know that big bird was driving the federal deficit   i laughter i  but that's what we heard last night  how about that   i audience member i  and elmo   i the president i  elmo too   i laughter i  look  the fact is  governor romney's math just doesn't add up  and i had to spend a lot of time last night trying to pin it down  the only one way to pay for   trillion in new tax cuts and   trillion in new defense spending that the military says it doesn't need is by asking the middle class to pay more  you and i refuse to do that  i refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i refuse to ask students to pay for more for college or kick children out of head start programs or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans who are poor or elderly or disabled just to pay for more tax cuts that we cannot afford  and i will never turn medicare into a voucher  governor romney doubled down on that proposal last night  and he is wrong  no american should have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  they should retire with the care and the dignity that they have earned  so yes  we'll reform and strengthen medicare for the long haul  but we'll do it by reducing the cost of health care  not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more  and we will keep the promise of social security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it  not by turning it over to wall street  now  going forward we're going to have a chance to talk a little bit about what's going on overseas  because our prosperity at home is linked to what happens abroad  four years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  and i did  i said we'd wind down the war in afghanistan in a responsible way  and we are  while a new tower is rising above the new york skyline  al qaida is on the path to defeat  and usama bin laden is dead  but we still face serious threats around the world  we saw that just a few weeks ago  and that's why  so long as i'm commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  and when our troops take off their uniforms  we will serve them as well as they've served us  because nobody should have to fight for a job when they come home  or a roof over their heads when they have fought for their country  they have earned our respect and our honor  that's a commitment i make  now  it will be interesting to see what the guy who was playing mitt romney yesterday i laughter i will say about foreign policy when we meet next  because he said it was  tragic  to end the war in iraq  he won't tell us how he'll end the war in afghanistan  and i'll use the money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and to put more people back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our schools and our runways and broadband lines  because after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building here at home and put some folks to work here at home  so this is the choice we now face  this is what the election comes down to  over and over  we've been told by our opponents that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if a company is releasing toxic pollution into the air that your children breathe  well  that's the price of progress  can't afford to regulate  if you can't afford to start a business or go to college  just borrow money from your parents   i laughter i  well  as i described last night  that's not who we are  that's not what this country is about  here in america  we believe we're all in this together  we understand america is not about what can be done for us  it's about what can be done by us together  as one nation  and as one people  you understand that  you understand that  denver  you are the reason that there's a teacher in pueblo who  with her husband  can buy her first phone with first home with the help of new tax credits that we helped pass  we couldn't have done it without you  you made that happen  you're the reason that a woman outside durango can get the treatment she needs to beat cancer now that there are affordable plans to cover preexisting conditions  you did that  you made that happen  you're the reason that thousands of students at cu boulder and colorado state and university of denver have more help paying for college this year  that happened because of you  you're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home  you're the reason why an outstanding soldier won't be kicked out of the military because of who he loves  you're the reason why thousands of families have been able to say to the loved ones who served us so bravely   welcome home   i applause i  welcome home  welcome home  if you turn away now  if you buy into the cynicism that somehow the change we fought for isn't possible  then of course  change won't happen  if you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference  then other folks fill the void  lobbyists and special interests and the people who are writing the   million checks  and all the spin will end up dominating the airwaves  and that's how things go  and ordinary folks get left out  all the folks who are trying to make it harder for you to vote  the folks in washington who think somehow that they should control the health care choices that women should be making for themselves   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  only you can make change happen  only you have the power to move us forward  from the day we began this campaign  i always said real change takes time  it takes more than one term  it takes more even than one president or one party  you certainly can't do it if you've got a president who writes off half the nation before he even takes office  in     percent of the country didn't vote for me  but on the night of the election  i said to all those americans  i may not have won your vote  but i hear your voices  i need your help  and i will be your president too  and so i want to say to denver  i want to say to the entire great state of colorado  i don't know how many of you will be with me around with me this time around  but i'll be with you no matter what  because i'm not fighting to create democratic jobs or republican jobs  i'm fighting to create american jobs  i'm not fighting to improve schools in red states or blue states  i'm fighting to improve schools in the united states  the values we care about don't just belong to workers or businesses or the rich or the poor or the   percent or the   percent  they are american values  they belong to all of us  and if we reclaim them now  if we rally around a new sense of economic patriotism  a sense of how we build an economy from the middle out and give ladders of opportunity for everybody who is willing to work hard  we will strengthen the middle class  we'll keep moving forward  i still believe that our politics is not as divided as it seems sometimes  i still believe in you  i'm asking you to keep on believing in me  i'm asking for your vote  and if you're willing to stand with me and work with me  we're going to win denver again  we'll win colorado again  we'll finish what we started  we will remind the world just why it is the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  thank you  everybody  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america  hey "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  everybody  hello  george mason  hello  patriots  it's good to see you guys  thank you  thank you so much   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  everybody  have a seat  have a seat  thank you  well  it is so good to be here  i am so proud to have katherine's support  can you give her a big round of applause for that great introduction  it's also good to know that we've got the former governor and next united states senator from the commonwealth of virginia  tim kaine  and your congressman jerry connolly  and it's good to see all of you  so   month  just   month from tomorrow  virginia  you're going to step into a voting booth  and you are going to have a very big choice to make  i know folks in this crowd may have already made some decisions  but for the undecideds that are here i laughter i as well as those who are watching today  i've said this before  this is a choice not just between two candidates or two parties  but a choice between two fundamentally different visions for america  and today  i believe that as a nation  we are moving forward again   i applause i  we're moving forward  now  after losing about   jobs a month when i took office  our businesses have now added   million new jobs over the past    years  this morning we found out that the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since i took office  more americans entered the workforce  more people are getting jobs  now every month reminds us that we've still got too many of our friends and neighbors who are looking for work  and there are too many middle class families that are still struggling to pay the bills  they were struggling long before the crisis hit  but today's news certainly is not an excuse to try to talk down the economy to score a few political points  it's a reminder that this country has come too far to turn back now  because of your strength and resilience the strength and resilience of the american people we have made too much progress to return to the policies that led to the crisis in the first place  i can't allow that to happen  i won't allow that to happen  and that is why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  i have seen too much pain  seen too much struggle  to let this country get hit with another round of top down economics  one of the main reasons we had this crisis is because big banks on wall street were allowed to make big bets with other people's money  and now governor romney wants to roll back the rules we put in place to stop that behavior  that's not going to happen   i applause i  that is not going to happen  one of the main reasons record surpluses under bill clinton were turned into record deficits under george bush is because we put two wars and two tax cuts on a credit card  and now governor romney wants another   trillion in tax cuts that he can't pay for  not if i have anything to say about it  that's not going to happen  we are not going to let this country fall backward  not now  not with so much at stake  we've got to move forward  we need to invest in small business and manufacturers who create jobs here in the united states  we need to recruit   math and science teachers  train   million workers at community college  bring down the cost of college tuition  we need to cut our oil imports in half  create thousands more jobs in clean energy  we need to use the savings from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan to help pay down our deficit and put people back to work doing some nation building right here at home  that's the agenda we need  that's how you strengthen the middle class  that's how you keep moving forward  that is the choice in this election  and that's why i'm running for a second term  that's what we need  my opponent has been trying to do a two step and reposition i laughter i and got an extreme makeover   i laughter i  but the bottom line is  his underlying philosophy is the top down economics that we've seen before  he thinks that if we just spend another   trillion on tax cuts that yes  skewed towards the wealthiest if we get rid of more regulations on wall street  then our problems will be solved  jobs and prosperity will rain down from the sky  the deficits will magically disappear  we will live happily ever after   i laughter i  even though he's been proposing this plan for months now  he's had a little trouble explaining just how it would work without blowing a hole in the deficit or making middle class families pick up the tab  the other night  he ruled out asking millionaires and billionaires to pay even a dime more in taxes  he said there's no way that he'd close the loophole that gives big oil companies billions each year in corporate welfare  ending tax breaks for corporations that move jobs and profits overseas  he'd never heard of such a thing   i laughter i  who knew   i applause i who knew  when he was asked what he'd actually do to cut spending and reduce the deficit  his big example is to go after public television   i laughter i  so for all you moms and kids out there  don't worry  someone is finally getting tough on big bird   i laughter i  rounding him up  elmo has got to watch out too   i laughter i  governor romney plans to let wall street run wild again  but he's going to bring down the hammer on  sesame street  it makes perfect sense   i laughter i  virginia  we can't afford to double down on the same old top down economic policies that caused this mess in the first place  we cannot afford another round of tax cuts for the wealthy  we can't afford to gut our investments in education or clean energy or research and technology  we can't afford to roll back regulations on wall street banks or oil companies or insurance companies  that is not a jobs plan  it's not a plan to grow our economy  it's sure not a plan to strengthen our middle class  we have been there  we have tried that  we're not going back  we are moving forward  we've got a different view about how we create jobs and prosperity in this country  this country doesn't just succeed when just a few are doing well at the top  it succeeds when the middle class gets bigger  our economy doesn't grow from the top down  it grows from the middle out  we don't believe that anybody is entitled to success in this country  but we do believe in opportunity  we believe in a country where hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded  and everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules  that's the country we believe in  that's what we've been fighting for over the last   years  that's what we are going to put in place in the next   years if you reelect me as president of the united states of america  that's what we're going to do   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  today i also want to talk about economic issues that didn't get enough attention in the debate the other night  and that's economic issues that have a direct impact on women and  as a consequence  have a direct impact on families  when it comes to the economy  it's bad enough that our opponents want to take us back to the failed policies of the last decade  when it comes to a woman's right to make her own health care choices  they want to take us back to the policies of the  s   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  this election is your chance to make sure that doesn't happen  virginia  the decisions that affect a woman's health aren't up to politicians  they're not up to insurance companies  they're up to you   i applause i  they're up to you  you deserve a president who will fight to keep it that way  that's the president i've been  that's the president i'll be if you give me a second term  you don't have to take me at my word  you can look at my record  four years ago  i said i'd pass health reform before the end of my first term  thanks to your help  that's what we did  the new health care law helps make sure you don't have to worry about going broke just because you or a loved one gets sick  insurance companies can no longer put lifetime limits on your care or jack up your premiums without reason or drop your coverage when you need it most  they can no longer discriminate against children with preexisting conditions  and soon  they will no longer be able to deny you coverage based on preexisting conditions like breast cancer or charge you more for the same care just because you're a woman  this law has already allowed nearly   million young adults under the age of   to sign up and stay on their parent's health care plan  it's already saved millions of seniors on medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription medicine  and millions of americans have actually gotten a rebate from their insurance company if that company's   i audience member i   i inaudible i   i the president   i you've got one  see  i just want to say  she's not a plant   i laughter i  i mean  she's a supporter  but i didn't know about i laughter i but you get a rebate if the insurance company spent too much money on administrative costs and ceo bonuses and not enough on your health care   i the president i  this law has secured new access to preventive care like mammograms and cancer screenings with no copay  no deductible  no out of pocket cost for more than   million women  and now most health plans are beginning to cover the cost of contraceptive care  which is vital for women's health  doctors prescribe contraception not only for family planning  but as a way to reduce the risk of ovarian and other cancers  and it's good for our health care system in general because we know the overall cost of care is lower when women have access to contraceptive services  now  before this new law  many health care plans charged high deductibles or copays for these preventive services  or they just didn't cover them that all  according to one study  more than half of all women put off the care they needed because of that  how many of you have gone without the care you needed or the checkup you knew just because you were worried that the insurance copay would go too high and you couldn't afford gas or groceries or your kid's new soccer uniform  so you have had to make choices and sacrifices  i don't think a working mom in arlington should have to wait to get a mammogram just because money is tight  i don't think a college student in fairfax or charlottesville should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs  that's why we passed this law  and i am proud of it  it was the right thing to do  and we are going to keep it  now  my opponent has a different view  the other night  he said he'd repeal obamacare as soon as he took office   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote   i applause i  vote  vote  but after he said that  then he backtracked and said  no  wait  at least i'll make sure to cover folks with preexisting conditions  and then  i explained  well  actually  your plan doesn't do that  and then his campaign had to come out and say  actually  that's not true  our plan wouldn't do that   i laughter i  so governor romney was fact checked by his own campaign   i laughter i  that's rough   i applause i  that's rough  even they know his plan would take away coverage for tens of millions of americans  governor romney said he'd get rid of planned parenthood funding  apparently  this  along with big bird  is driving the deficits   i audience member i   i inaudible i big bird   i the president i   i laughter i  and he would have supported an extreme measure in massachusetts that would have outlawed some forms of contraception  he joined the far right of his party to support a bill that would allow any employer to deny contraceptive coverage to their employees  i mean  think about that  your boss telling you what's best for your health and safety  let me tell you something  virginia  i don't think your boss should control the care you get  i don't think insurance companies should control the care you get  i definitely don't think politicians on capitol hill should control the care you get  we've seen some of their attitudes  we've read about those  i think there's one person who gets to make decisions about your health care  that's you  my opponent has called himself  severely conservative  but let me tell you something  there's nothing conservative as katherine made clear there's nothing conservative about a government that prevents a woman from making her own health care decisions  governor romney talks about freedom  but freedom is the ability to determine the care you need  when you need it   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  freedom is the ability to change jobs or start your own business without the fear of losing your health insurance  freedom is the knowledge that you'll no longer be charged more than men for the same health care or denied affordable coverage just because you've beat cancer  and at a time when women make up nearly half the workforce and an increasing share of family breadwinners  these are not just health issues or women's issues  these are economic issues that are vital and affect every family in america  they matter  when a woman is the main breadwinner for her family  but takes home less pay for the same work as a man does because she's a woman  that is not right  when my opponent's campaign was asked if he'd support legislation giving women the tools to fight for an equal day's pay for an equal day's work  he said   we'll get back to you on that  and since then  he's refused to explain his position  you've already got my answer  upholding the principle of equal pay for equal work  that was one of the first bills that i signed into law  i've named two extraordinary women who understand these issues on the supreme court  the highest court in the land  and remember  the next president  the next congress could tip the balance of the court in a way that turns back the clock for women and their families for decades to come  the choice between going backward and moving forward has never been so clear  virginia  we don't need a president who's promised to rubberstamp the top down agenda of the republicans in this congress  we don't want to go backward  we've got to go forward  from the day we began this campaign  we've always said that real change takes time  it takes more than one year or one term or even one president  it takes more than one party  it certainly can't happen if you're willing to write off half the nation before you even take office  you know  people forget  back in     percent of the country didn't vote for me  but on the night of the election  i said to all those americans  i said  i may not have won your vote  but i hear your voices and i need your help  and i will be your president too  and  virginia  i don't know how many of you will vote for me this time around  but i promise you  no matter how many do  i will be your president too  no matter what  i'll be fighting for you  because i'm not just fighting for democratic jobs or republican jobs  i'm fighting for american jobs  i'm not just fighting for good schools in blue states or red states  i'm fighting for good schools in the united states  the values that we are fighting for and care about of hard work and looking out for one another  those are not rich values or poor values or business values or worker values or red  white  black  asian it doesn't matter they are american values  they are american values  and if we rally around a new economic patriotism together  if we reclaim our values  we will rebuild this economy  we'll strengthen the middle class   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  we'll keep moving forward  i am confident our politics is not as divided as our politics suggest   i audience member i  that's why i love you   i the president i  i do i believe we've got more in common than the pundits are willing to tell you  i still believe in you  and i hope you still believe in me  and if you are willing to get out there and make some phone calls  and knock on some doors  beat the pavement if you'll vote for me in november we will win fairfax county again  we'll win virginia again  we'll finish what we started  and i'll remind the world  alongside you  why it is that the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  virginia  thank you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  cleveland state  how's it going  vikings   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  thank you so much  thank you  everybody  can everybody give tatiana an just give her a huge round of applause for that great introduction  it's good to see our members of congress who are here  marcia fudge  betty sutton  marcy kaptur  your mayor  frank jackson  cuyahoga county executive ed fitzgerald  and it's good to see all of you in the rain here  i appreciate it  thank you  i know everybody is a little wet  ladies  i know of you some of you just went to the hairdresser   i laughter i  i mean  so that's a big sacrifice  i want to thank everybody who's up there in the stands  we appreciate you  now  before i begin  ohio  i just have one question  are you registered to vote  because if you're not  if you are not  you've got   days left  if you are  you can vote right now  just go to vote barackobama com that's vote barackobama com to find out how to register and where to vote  because  ohio  you've got a big choice to make  not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  we've got a choice between two fundamentally different visions for america  today  i believe that as a nation  we're moving forward again  when i was sworn into office  we were losing   jobs a month  now our businesses have added   million jobs over the past   years  this morning we found out that the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since i took office  so more americans entered the workforce  more people are getting jobs  now  every month  we understand  especially here in cleveland and all around ohio  that there are too many friends and neighbors who are still looking for work  too many families who are still struggling to pay the bills  and they were struggling even before this recession hit  but today's news should give us some encouragement  it shouldn't be an excuse for the other side to try to talk down the economy just to try to score a few political points  it's a reminder that this country has come too far to turn back now  because of the strength and the resilience of the american people  we've made too much progress to return to the policies that led to this crisis in the first place  we can't allow that to happen  we won't allow that to happen  and that is why i'm running to be your president for   more years  four more  four more   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  i have seen too much pain and too much struggle to let this country go with another round of top down economics  one of the main reasons we had this crisis was because we had big banks on wall street making bets with other people's money  and now governor romney wants to roll back those rules that we put in place to stop that behavior   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  one of the main reasons we went from record surpluses into record deficits is because we put two wars and two tax cuts on a credit card  we didn't pay for them  and now mr  romney wants another   trillion in tax cuts that he can't pay for  we're not going to let that happen  we are not going to fall backwards  not with so much at stake  not now  it didn't work then  it won't work now  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  i will tell you what we need to move forward  we've got to invest in small businesses  we've got to invest in manufacturers who are creating jobs here in ohio  here in the united states of america  we've got to recruit   new math and science teachers to train  to make sure out young people have to make sure that our young people have the skills that they need  we've got to train   million workers at community colleges to bring down college tuition costs  we've got to cut our oil imports in half and create thousands of new jobs in energy  we've got to use the savings from ending the war in iraq and afghanistan to pay down our deficit  put some people to work doing some nation building right here at home  that's the agenda we need  that's how you strengthen the middle class  that's how you keep moving forward  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm asking for your vote  now  my opponent  he was doing a lot of a little tap dance at the debate the other night  trying to wiggle out of stuff he's been saying for a year  doing  like  a it was like  dancing with the stars   i laughter i  or maybe it was  extreme makeover i laughter i debate edition  but no matter what he says  my opponent  he's a big believer of these top down economics  he thinks that if we spend another   trillion on tax cuts that favor the wealthiest  we get rid of more regulations on wall street  all of our problems are going to be solved  jobs and prosperity will rain down from the sky   i laughter i  deficits will magically disappear  we'll live happily ever after  even though he's been proposing this plan for months now  he's run into a little trouble explaining how it would work without blowing up the deficit or making it work for middle class families  the other night  he ruled out asking millionaires and billionaires to pay even a dime more in taxes  he said  no way he was going to close loopholes that are giving big oil companies billions of dollars each year in corporate welfare  ending tax breaks for corporations that are shipping jobs overseas and profits overseas  he said he'd never heard of such a thing  never heard of it  who knew  he said  he acted shocked  said he needs a new accountant   i laughter i  his current accountant is doing just fine  when he was asked how he'd actually cut spending and reduce the deficit  he said he'd go after funding for public television   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  so for all you moms and kids out there  don't worry  somebody is finally getting tough on big bird   i laughter i  elmo  you better make a run for it   i laughter i  governor romney is going to let wall street run wild again  but he's going to bring the hammer down on  sesame street   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  you want me to save big bird   i audience members i  save big bird  save big bird  save big bird   i the president i   i laughter i  look  cleveland  we cannot afford to double down on the same  old  top down economic policies that caused this mess in the first place  we can't afford another round of tax cuts for wealthy folks  we've got to give and maintain tax cuts for you  that's what i did when i came into office  and we're going to keep them in place  we can't afford to cut investments in education or clean energy or research or technology  we can't afford to roll back regulations on wall street or oil companies or insurance companies  that's not a jobs plan  that's not a plan to grow the economy  that's not a plan to grow the middle class  we have been there  we have done that  it didn't work  we're not going back  we're moving forward  that's why i'm running for a second term as president  that's why i need your vote  ohio  we've got a different view about how you create jobs and prosperity  this country succeeds not just when folks at the top are doing well  this country succeeds when everybody has a shot  when the middle class is growing  when people who are willing to work hard have ladders into the middle class  our economy grows from the middle out  not the top down  now  i understand we don't believe anybody is entitled to success in this country  but we do believe in something called opportunity  we believe in a nation where hard work pays off  responsibility is rewarded  everybody is getting a fair shot  everybody is doing their fair share  everybody is playing by the same rules  not just rules benefiting a few  but in order for us to make this happen  you guys are going to have to vote  and you're going to have to rally around the plan that i've presented  number one  making sure we've got the best education system in the world  tatiana is an example of the incredible potential that our young people have  but we've got to make that real for them  so i want to help hire another   new math and science teachers  i want to make sure that anybody who wants to get retrained for a job that's out there right now knows they've got a slot at the community college  i want to make sure that tuition is affordable for anybody who wants to go to cleveland state  anybody who wants to go to ohio state  anybody who wants to pursue a higher education and is willing to put the work in  i want to make sure that we're investing in companies that are putting down roots here in ohio and here in the united states  remember  when we saved that auto industry  mr  romney said  let's let detroit go bankrupt  i put my bet on american workers and american industries  and so now we've got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give them to companies that are hiring right here in ohio  hiring right here in cleveland  that's what we need  we need to develop our energy sources  but in addition to oil and gas and clean coal technology which we  by the way  have made the largest investment ever in clean coal technology  but we also need to develop wind and solar  because there are jobs in ohio right now  folks making wind turbines and making long lasting batteries  we've got to continue to do that  we've got to reduce our deficit  but we got to do in a sensible way  i am not going to kick kids off of head start  i'm not going to make college more expensive for the students here at cleveland state just to give another tax break to folks who don't need it and weren't even asking for it  and when it comes to overseas  i am proud that when i promised to end the war in iraq  i did  i said i'm going to wind down the war in afghanistan  and i have  mitt romney has different ideas  he likes to talk tough  but what i know is  is that thanks to the incredible service of our men and women in uniform  al qaida is on the run and usama bin laden is no more  that's why  as commander in chief  i will maintain the strongest military the world has ever known  but i'm also going to make sure when our troops come home and they take off their uniform  we serve them as well as they have served us  they shouldn't have to fight for a job when they come home after they've fought for us all these years  so look  here's the bottom line  ohio  we've got more work to do  but the only way we're going to do it is with you  you're the reason we passed health care reform so that children out there are all able to get insurance even if they've got a preexisting condition  you're the reason that we've been able to help young people attend college by trying to give them more pell grants and more financial aid  you're the reason that families all across ohio have been able to get a little bit of a tax break  a little extra money in their pockets  which then means businesses have more customers  which means businesses then hire more workers  which means the economy begins to heal from the mess that we inherited  you made these things happen  you were the ones who helped us end  don't ask  don't tell  you're the ones who are helping to make sure that we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars  you're the ones who are helping us to go into neighborhoods that have had tough times in cleveland and all across this country and say  let's put people back to work rebuilding foreclosed homes  let's put folks back to working making sure that we're rebuilding our roads and our bridges  but if that progress is going to continue  you've got to step up  and i know i'm preaching to the choir here because you all are standing in the rain  but a little rain never hurt anybody  some of these policies from the other side could hurt a whole lot of folks  so we've only got just a little over a month left  and you can start voting right now  and the way we're going to do it is reminding ourselves that the only way this country makes progress is when we do it together  black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  young  old  rich  poor  abled  and disabled  all of us together have to do this  when i was elected in     percent of the people did not vote for me  but i didn't say  well  i'm not going to worry about those folks  i didn't say that  i stood in grant park  and i looked at the camera  and i said  even though you didn't vote for me  i've heard your voices  i need your help  and i will be your president too  i will fight for you too  and so i don't know how many folks will vote for me this time in ohio  but i'm not but i'm here to tell everybody independents  republicans  tea partiers  all of you i will be your president too  i will fight just as hard for you  because i still believe in you  and if you still believe in me  if you're willing to make some phone calls  if you're willing to knock on some doors  if you're willing to talk to your friends and your neighbors  your uncles  your cousins  your aunts  you coworkers  and tell them this election counts and it matters and it will help determine not just our future  but our children's future and our grandchildren's futures and our great grandchildren's futures if you're willing to make that commitment  i promise you  i will fight for you every single day that i've got the privilege of being your president  we will win ohio  we will win this election  we'll finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  everybody  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  san francisco  thank you  i love you back  thank you  everybody  now  there are a couple of people i want to acknowledge who are here tonight  first of all  give it up for your mayor  ed lee  in the house  your attorney general  kamala harris  is here  got a couple of outstanding members of congress  barbara lee and pete stark  it appears that john legend and michael franti did a pretty good job firing you up  and we've got two san francisco  ers  alex smith  your quarterback  alex smith  that tight end  vernon davis  i've had a chance to meet them  they seem like wonderful young men and just so impressive and poised  so i can't help but wish them the best of luck  until they play my bears in week    i audience members i  boo   i the president i  what happened  what happened  come on   i laughter i  now  i know that was quite a show  you guys have been having fun  but now we've got to get down to business  we're here because we've got some work to do  we're here because we've got an election to win  we're here because everything we fought for in   is on the line in   and i'm going to need your help to finish what we started  now    years ago  i made a few commitments to you  i told you i'd end the war in iraq  and i did  i said i'd end the war in afghanistan  and we are  i said we'd refocus on the people who actually attacked us on   and today  al qaida is on its heels  and usama bin laden is no more  four years ago  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  and we have by   i promised to cut taxes for small business owners  and we have   times  we got back every dime used to rescue the banks  and we passed a law to end taxpayer funded wall street bailouts for good  we passed health care reform  also known as  a k a  obamacare  and we did so because i do care  i care that folks with preexisting conditions can still get insurance  i care that your insurance companies don't jerk you around  i care that we make sure that being a woman is not considered a preexisting condition and an excuse to pay people more  i told you that we would make sure that nobody who serves this country so bravely will ever be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love  we ended  don't ask  don't tell  when governor romney said  we should  let detroit go bankrupt  we said  i don't think we're going to take your business advice  we reinvented a dying auto industry that's now back on top of the world  three years  years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  our businesses have created more than   million new jobs  this past friday  we found out that the unemployment rate had fallen from a height of   percent down to    percent  white house correction  the lowest level since i took office  manufacturers are coming back to america  home values are on the rise  we are not there yet  we're not where we need to be yet  there are still too many americans looking for work  too many families who are having trouble paying the bills  too many homes underwater  too many young people burdened with debt from going to school  but if there's one thing i know  it is this  we have come too far to turn back now  the last thing we can afford  california  right now is   years of the very same policies that led us into the mess in the first place  we've spent   years cleaning it up  we don't want another mess  we can't allow that to happen  i won't allow it to happen  and that's why i'm running for a second term for president of the united states of america  i've seen too much pain and too much struggle to let this country get hit with another round of top down economics  the centerpiece of my opponent governor romney's economic plan is a   trillion tax cut skewed towards the wealthy  he's been pitching this plan for almost   years now   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  no  don't boo  vote  he stood up on stage during one of the primary debates  proudly promised that he that his tax cuts would include the top   percent  he promised this  but most of the economists who crunched the numbers said governor romney's plan would either blow up the deficit or raise taxes on the middle class  it's one or the other  that's how arithmetic works   i laughter i  so a few weeks ago  you can start seeing he's figuring out  well  this isn't maybe selling that well   i laughter i  and then  a few nights ago  suddenly a guy pretending to be mitt romney stood on a stage next to me i laughter i and said he's changing his plan  he is just going to pretend it doesn't exist  what   trillion tax cut  i don't know anything about a   trillion tax cut  don't pay any attention to that tax cut behind the curtain   i laughter i  during the debate he said  there is no economist who can say mitt romney's tax plan adds   trillion to the deficit if i say i will not add to the deficit with my tax plan  thanks for clearing that up   i laughter i  we'll take your word for it  this was almost as believable as when he said he'd bring down our deficit by going after what has been the biggest driver of our debt and deficits over the last decade  public television  pbs   i laughter i  you didn't know this  but for all you moms and kids out there  you should have confidence that finally somebody is cracking down on big bird  elmo is has been seen in a white suburban  he's driving for the border  oscar is hiding out in his trashcan   i laughter i  we're cracking down on them  governor romney's plan is to let wall street run wild again  but he's going to bring the hammer down on sesame street   i laughter i  listen  after the debate  i had a bunch of folks come to me  don't be so polite  don't be so nice   i laughter i  but i want everybody to understand something  what was being presented wasn't leadership  that's salesmanship  and we cannot afford another round of tax cuts for the wealthy  we can't afford to gut investments in education or clean energy or research and technology  we can't afford to roll back regulations on wall street banks or major polluters or insurance companies  that is not a jobs plan  that's not a plan to grow the economy  that's not change we can believe in  that's a relapse  we have been there  we have tried that  we are not going back  we are moving forward  that's why you're here  that's why i'm here  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  look   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  we have a different vision about how you create jobs and prosperity in america  we have to change our tax code so it stops rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to reward small businesses and manufacturers who are investing and taking root right here in the united states of america  we can create more jobs controlling our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that's good for our economy  it's good for our national security  it's good for our environment  and today  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades  so we don't want to reverse that progress  we've got to build on it  my plan would cut our oil imports in half  and we can invest in the clean energy that's creating thousands of jobs all across america right now  wind power and solar power and clean coal  fuel efficient cars  long lasting batteries  we're producing oil and natural gas at record rates  but we have to make sure that we're also grabbing for the future  we can't cede that to somebody else  and unlike my opponent  i will not allow oil companies to collect another   billion every single year in taxpayer funded corporate welfare  i'm not going to let china win the race for clean energy technologies  i want to see those technologies developed right here in california  right here in the united states of america  and as i said at the convention  yes  my plan will continue to reduce carbon pollution because climate change is not a hoax  drought  floods  wildfires  they're not a joke  they're a threat to our kids' future  that's what we're fighting for  i believe we've got to have the best education system in the world  that will create jobs  that's good for business  making sure that everybody has the skills they need to compete and to be good citizens  education is the reason i'm standing here today  it's why michelle was able to do everything she's done in her life  it's true for so many of all the folks here  so now we've got a choice  we can gut education to pay for tax breaks that we don't need  or we can recruit   new math and science teachers  focus on early childhood education  provide job training for   million more workers in our community colleges  help to lower tuition costs for our students going to college  we can meet those goals  that's what we're fighting for  that's what's at stake in the next   days  that's why i'm running for a second term as president  i want to use some of the money we're saving from ending the wars in iraq and winding down our efforts in afghanistan to pay down our deficit  put people back to work all across america rebuilding roads and bridges  airports and schools  infrastructure  that's what i'm talking about   i laughter i  i'm pitching  you're catching  governor romney  he has a different view  he said it was  tragic  to end the war in iraq  in a speech today  he doubled down on that belief  he said ending the war was a mistake  i disagree  bringing our troops home was the right thing to do  and every brave american who wears the uniform of this country should know that as long as i'm commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  and when our troops take off their uniforms  we will serve them as well as they served us  because nobody who has fought for us should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  and  yes  we need to cut our deficit and reduce our debt  and   i audience member i  i love you   i the president i  i love you back  but we do have to reduce our debt and our deficits  and i've put forward a   trillion plan to get it done over the next   years  we've already worked with democrats and republicans to cut a trillion dollars in spending  i am ready to do more  but we cannot just cut our way to prosperity  we cannot get this done unless we ask the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over   the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  we created   million new jobs  went from deficit to surplus  created a whole lot of millionaires and successful small businesses as well  governor romney says it's fair that he pays a lower tax rate than a teacher or an autoworker who makes    i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  you know what  i refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids to pay for a tax cut we don't need  i refuse to pay for a tax cut for millionaires and billionaires by asking those students who are here today to pay more for college or kicking kids off of head start or eliminating health insurance for millions of americans who are poor or elderly or disabled  that is not what has built this country  that is not what we believe  that is not what's going to happen  we are going to go forward  not backwards  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  so  san francisco  california  this is the choice we now face  it's what the election comes down to  over and over  we are told by opponents that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  basic philosophy is  you're on your own  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  companies are releasing pollution that our kids are breathing  well  that's just the price of progress  you can't afford to start a business or go to college  just borrow money from your parents   i laughter i  that's not who we are  that's not what this country is about  here in america  we believe in individual initiative  we believe that we can't help folks who don't want to try to help themselves  but we also believe in opportunity  we also believe we're all in this together  we also understand that america is not about what can be done for us  it's about what can be done by us  together  as one nation  as one people  that's what you all understood in   that's what change was about  you all of us coming together  you're the reason there's a little girl somewhere here in california who is going to get the care she needs because an insurance company can't impose some sort of lifetime limit on her coverage  you're the reason a factory worker who lost his job in toledo or lordstown  ohio  is back on the line building some of the best cars in the world  you're the reason that a student right here has help paying for a college education or a veteran can go to school on the new gi bill  you're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here  pledged allegiance to our flag  will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home  you're the reason why a soldier who has served us so bravely will not be kicked out of the military because of who they love  you made that happen  you're the reason that soldier can come home to his loved ones and hear those words   welcome home  you made that happen  and so i need you in this election  the next   days  we cannot afford to be complacent  and we cannot afford to be cynical  we've got to look back at the progress we've made  and that should give us confidence  but we have to understand  we've got a lot more to do  and if we don't do it  then change won't happen  your voice will make a difference  and if you don't make that difference  then other people will fill the void  lobbyists and special interests and the folks who write the   million checks to try to win this race and the ones who are trying to make it harder for people to vote  the politicians in washington who somehow think that they've got a better idea than women about women's health care choices those are the folks that are going to be making decisions if you are not making those decisions  only you can make sure those things don't happen  only you've got the power to move us forward  i will be there with you  but this is a team  people  from the day we began this campaign  i always said that change takes time  we always said that it would take more than one term or even one president  we said it would take more than one party  and by the way  no  it doesn't just take me  that's not the deal  the deal is it takes all of us  that's the deal  it won't happen if you've got somebody who writes off half the nation even before he takes office  but it also won't happen if half the nation writes off itself by not participating or doesn't vote  in     percent of the country didn't vote for me  but on the night of the election  i said to all those americans  i may not have won your vote  but i hear your voices  i need your help  i'll be your president too  i don't know how many of you will be with me this time around  but i'll be with you  i'll be there fighting for you because i'm not fighting to create democratic jobs or republican jobs  i'm fighting to create american jobs  i'm not fighting to improve schools in red states or blue states  i'm fighting to improve schools in the united states  i'm not fighting for red values or white values or black values or latino values or gay or straight values  i'm fighting for american values  they belong to all of us  san francisco  we are not as divided as our politics would suggest  we've got more in common than our pundits believe  i still believe in you  i'm asking you to keep believing in me  i'm asking for your vote  i'm asking you to knock on doors  i'm asking you to make phone calls  and if you do  we will win this election  we'll finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  buckeyes  o h   i audience members i  i o   i the president i  o h   i audience members i  i o   i the president

we've got an election to win  everything that we fought for in   is on the line in   and i need your help to finish what we started  four years ago  i told you i'd end the war in iraq  and we did  i said i'd end the war in afghanistan  and we are  i said we'd refocus on the people who actually attacked us on  and today  usama bin laden is dead  four years ago  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  and we have  by   i promised to cut taxes for small business owners  and we have   times  we got back every dime we used to rescue the banks  and we also passed a law to end taxpayer funded wall street bailouts permanently  we passed health care reform  also known as obamacare  because i do care  i don't want insurance company jerking you around anymore  i don't want somebody without health care when they've got a preexisting condition  we repealed  don't ask  don't tell  as i promised we would  today  no outstanding soldier or marine or coastguardsman  sailor  airman none of them can be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love  and when you think about  ohio  when governor romney said that we should just let the auto industry go bankrupt  we said no  we're not going to take your advice   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  and we reinvented a dying auto industry that supports one in eight ohio jobs and has come roaring back to the top of the world  four years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  our businesses have created more than   million new jobs  this past friday  we found out that the unemployment rate had fallen from a high of   percent down to   percent  the lowest level since i took office  manufacturing is coming back to america  home values are back on the rise  now  we're not there yet  we've still got too many americans who are looking for work and too many families who can't pay the bills  there are too many homes that are still underwater  and there are too many young people who are burdened by too much debt after they graduate  but if there's one thing i know  ohio  it's this  we have come too far to turn back now  the american people have worked too hard  and the last thing we can afford to do right now is to go back to the very same policies that got us into this mess in the first place  i cannot allow that to happen  i will not allow it to happen  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  over the last   years  i've seen a lot of folks hurting  i've seen a lot of struggle  and i am not going to make i'm not going to have us go back to another round of top down economics  but that's what my opponent is offering  the centerpiece of governor romney's economic plan is a new   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthiest americans  he has been pitching that plan for an entire year  stood up onstage in one of his primary debates  proudly promised that his tax cuts would include the  top   percent  but most of the economists who've actually crunched the numbers said that paying for governor romney's tax plan either means blowing up the deficit or raising taxes on middle class families  one or the other  pick your poison  then  last week  mitt romney actually said   there's no economist who can say mitt romney's tax plan adds   trillion if i say i will not add to the deficit with my tax plan  so he said if he says it's not true  then it's not true   i laughter i  okay  so if it's true that it's not going to add to the deficit  that leaves only one option  and that's asking middle class families to foot the bill by getting rid of the deductions they rely on for owning a home or raising their kids or sending them to college  and as it turns out  most folks don't like that idea either  so just last week when we were onstage together  governor romney decided that instead of changing his plan  he'd just pretend it didn't exist   i laughter i  what   trillion tax cut  i don't know anything about a   trillion tax cut  pay no attention to that tax cut under the carpet  behind the curtain   i laughter i  when he's asked how he'll cut the deficit  he says he can make the math work by eliminating local public funding for pbs   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  now  by the way  this is not new  this is what he's been saying every time he's asked the question well  we can cut out pbs  so for all you moms and kids out there  don't worry  somebody is finally getting tough on big bird   i laughter i  who knew that he was driving our deficit   i laughter i  so we're going he's decided we're going after big bird  and elmo is making a run for the border  and oscar is hiding out in a trash can   i laughter i  and governor romney wants to let wall street run wild again  but he's going to bring down the hammer on sesame street   i laughter i  look  that is not leadership  that's salesmanship  we can't afford it  we can't afford to double down on top down economics  we can't afford another round of tax cuts for the wealthy  we can't afford to roll back regulations on wall street banks or on insurance companies  we can't afford to gut our investments in education or clean energy or research or technology  that is not a jobs plan  that is not a plan to grow the economy  that is not change  that is a relapse  we have been there  we have tried that  we are not going back  we are moving forward  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  look  we've got a different view about how you create jobs and prosperity in america  a strong economy doesn't trickle down from the top  it grows from a thriving middle class and folks who are working hard to get into the middle class  i believe it's time our tax code stopped rewarding companies that ship jobs overseas  let's reward small businesses and manufacturers who are making products right here in ohio  products stamped with three proud words   made in america  that's the choice in this election  i believe we can create more jobs by controlling more of our own energy  and after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  and today  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in two decades  so now it's time to move forward  my plan would cut our oil imports in half and invest in the clean energy that's creating thousands of jobs all across ohio and america right now  not just oil and natural gas  but solar and wind and clean coal technology and fuel efficient batteries and fuel efficient cars  and i'm not going to let oil companies continue to collect another   billion in taxpayer funded corporate welfare every single year  i'm not going to let china win the race for clean energy technology  i want to see that technology developed by students and scientists here in columbus  by workers and farmers all across ohio  by patriots here in the united states of america  and my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet  because climate change is not a hoax  more draught and floods and wildfires are not a joke  they're a threat to your future  and we've got to make sure that we meet the moment  that's why i'm running  i believe that we should have the best education system in the world  bar none  i would not be here if it were not for the education i was able to receive  i didn't come from wealth or fame  but i got a great education because that's what this country does  that it was the gateway of opportunity for michelle  it's the gateway of opportunity for so many of you  and now you've got a choice  we can gut education to pay for governor romney's tax cuts  that's exactly what his running mate  paul ryan  proposes   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote   i laughter i  or we can do what i've proposed  recruit   new math and science teachers  focus on early childhood education  provide job training for   million workers at our community colleges  cut the growth of tuition costs in half so that you guys are not loaded up with debt when you graduate  that is something we can do  and by the way  i don't just talk the talk on this  i walk the walk  we took   billion that was going to banks and lenders under the student loan program  and we said let's cut out the middleman  let's give the money directly to students  and as a consequence  millions of young people all across the country are getting better deals on pell grants  we're able to keep our student loan rates low  we have focused on this  and you need to focus on this in this next election because this is part of the choice that you're going to face  and we can meet these goals together  you can choose a better future for america  i want to use the money we're saving from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan  and i want to use that to pay down our deficit  but also to put people back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our schools all across america  and governor romney said it was  tragic  to end the war in iraq  i disagree  i think bringing our troops home to their families was the right thing to do  if he'd gotten his way  those troops would still be there  in a speech yesterday  he doubled down on that belief  he said ending that war was a mistake  after   years of war  more than   trillion in spending  extraordinary sacrifices by our men and women in uniform and their families  he said we should still have troops on the ground in iraq  ohio  you can't turn a page on the failed policies of the past if you're promising to repeat them  we cannot afford to go back to a foreign policy that gets us into wars with no plan to end them  we're moving forward  not going back  and every brave american who wears the uniform of this country should know  as long as i'm your commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  and when our troops take off the uniform  we will serve them as well as they've served us because nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  and finally  i'll cut the deficit by   trillion over the next   years  i've already worked with the republicans and democrats to cut a trillion dollars in spending  and i'm ready to do more  but we can't just cut our way to prosperity  we're not going to get this done unless we also ask the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on their incomes over   and that rate is the one that was in place when bill clinton was president  our economy created   million new jobs  the biggest surplus in history  a whole lot of millionaires to boot  governor romney said it's fair that he pays a lower tax rate than a teacher or autoworker who makes   he is wrong  i refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i refuse to pay for that tax cut by asking you  students  to pay more for college or kicking kids out of head start programs or eliminating health care for millions of americans who are poor or disabled or elderly  and that's the choice that we face in this election  that's what the election comes down to  over and over  we've been told by governor romney and congressman ryan and their allies in congress that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if a company releases pollution into the air that your kids breathe  that's just the price of progress  if you can't afford to start a business or go to college  just borrow money from your parents  you know what  that's not who we are  that's not what this country is about  here in america  we believe that we're all in this together  we understand that america is not about what can be done for us  it's about what can be done by us together  as one nation and as one people  and that's what we understood in   that was an amazing experience for me  obviously  that election  but i said then  and i still believe now  that wasn't about me  it was about you  you're the reason a mother in cincinnati doesn't have to worry about aninsurance company denying her son coverage just because he got sick  you made that happen  you're the reason a factory worker who lost his job in toledo or lordstown is back on the assembly line building the best cars in the world  you did that  you're the reason a young man in columbus whose mother worked three jobs to raise him can afford to go to the ohio state university  that happened because of you  you're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home  why soldiers won't be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love  why thousands of families have finally been able to say to loved ones who served us so bravely   welcome home  you did that  and so if you buy into the cynicism that says change isn't possible  that the best we can do is more tax cuts for folks at the top and the rest of folks have to figure it out  if you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference  then other voices fill the void  the lobbyists and the special interests  the people who write the   million checks to try to buy this election  or those who are trying to make it harder for you to vote  the washington politicians who want to tell women what they're doing when it comes to health care choices when women are perfectly capable of making those choices themselves  that's what's at stake  and only you can make sure that we move forward  only you have that power to move us forward  we've always said that change real change takes time  more than one year  more than one term  even more than one president  it takes more than one party  it can't happen if you're somebody who writes off half the nation before you even took office  and in you know  it's interesting  in     percent of the country didn't vote for me  but on the night of the election  i said to those americans  i may not have won your vote  but i hear your voices  i need your help  i'll be your president too  and  columbus  i don't know how many folks will be around voting for me this time  but i can tell you i will be there no matter what  i'll be fighting for you no matter what  because i'm not fighting to create democratic jobs or republican jobs  i'm fighting to create american jobs  i'm not fighting to improve schools in red states or blue states  i'm fighting to improve schools it the united states  the values that we are fighting for don't belong to one party or one group  they're not black or white or hispanic or asian or native america or gay or straight or disabled and not disabled  they are american values  they belong to all of us  and i am absolutely positive that we are not as divided as our politics suggest  i still believe we've got more in common than our pundits tell us  i still believe in you  and i'm asking you to keep believing in me  ohio  i'm asking you for your vote  and if you're willing to stand with me and work with me  knock on some doors and make some phone calls for me  we'll win franklin county again  we'll win ohio again  we'll win this election again  we'll finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  thank you  ohio  let's go vote  let's go win this election "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  miami  how's it going  hurricanes  can

i need your help to finish what we started  think about where we've been and how far we've come  four years ago  i told you i'd end the war in iraq  and i did  i said we'd end the war in afghanistan  and we are  i said we'd refocus on the people who actually attacked us on   and today  al qaida is on the run and usama bin laden is dead  four years ago  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  and we have  by   i promised to cut taxes for small business owners  and we have    times  we stabilized the banking system  but we got back every dime we used to rescue the banks with interest  and we passed a historic law to end taxpayer funded wall street bailouts for good  we passed health care reform  a k a  obamacare  so your insurance company can't jerk you around anymore and those of you under   can stay on your parent's plan  if you you can't have insurance companies barring you because you've got a preexisting condition  and they can't charge more just because you're a woman  we repealed  don't ask  don't tell  so nobody is ever kicked out of the military because of who they love  when governor romney said we should let detroit go bankrupt  we said  no  we're not going to take your business advice  we reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top of the world  and that makes a difference not just to communities across the midwest  it's vital for our entire economy  it's something every american can be proud of  today    years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  we are moving forward  after losing   jobs the month i was sworn in  our businesses have now added more than   million new jobs over the past   years  the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of   percent down to   percent  the lowest level since i took office  so more americans are getting jobs  and manufacturing is coming back  home values are on the rise  now  we know we're not where we need to be not yet  that's especially true in places like florida that were so hard hit  we've still got too many friends and neighbors who are looking for work  we've got too many families who can't pay the bills  too many homes that are still underwater  too many young people still burdened with debt when they graduate from college  but if there's one thing i know  florida  it's this  we have come too far to turn back now  the american people have worked too hard to get to this point  after all that we've been through together  after all that we fought through together  why would we go backwards  the last thing we can afford  florida  right now is   years of the very same policies that got us into this mess in the first place  i won't let that happen  we can't let that happen  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  florida  i have seen too much pain and too much struggle because of bad economic policies that happened before we got elected to let this country go through another round of top down economics  the centerpiece of governor romney's economic plan is a new   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthiest americans   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  vote  vote  now  governor romney has been pitching this plan for almost a year now  he stood up on the stage in one of his primary debates  proudly promised that his new tax cuts  on top of the bush tax cuts  would include the top   percent  now  you wouldn't know this from listening to the new  latest version of mitt romney   i laughter i  he's trying to go through an extreme makeover  after running for more than a year in which he called himself  severely conservative  mitt romney is trying to convince you that he was severely kidding   i laughter i  look  what he was selling was not working  because people understood his ideas wouldn't help the middle class  so these days  mitt romney's for whatever you're for   i laughter i  suddenly  he loves the middle class can't stop talking enough about them  he loves medicare  loves teachers  he even loves the most important parts of obamacare  what happened   i laughter i  now  what does he have to say  this new version of mitt romney  about all the things he's actually promised to do as president  tax breaks for outsourcers  never heard such a thing  saying we should cut back on teachers  doesn't ring a bell   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  kicking   young floridians off their parents' insurance plans who  me   i laughter i  and when he's asked about the cost of his tax plan  he just pretends it doesn't exist  what   trillion tax cut  i don't know anything about a   trillion tax cut  pay no attention to the   trillion tax cut on my web site   i laughter i  look  governor romney thinks we have not been paying attention for the last year and a half  he is going to say whatever it takes to try to close the deal  and he's counting on the fact that you don't remember that what he's selling is exactly what got us into this mess in the first place  so  florida  you've got to let him know we remember  we know full well that if he gets a chance  governor romney will rubberstamp the top down agenda of this republican congress the second he takes office  and we cannot afford that future  his plan will not create jobs  it will not help the middle class  it will not speed the recovery  it will slow down the recovery  it will not reduce the deficit  it will not expand opportunity  we can't afford it  we're not going back  we are moving forward  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  look  america  we know that in this country  jobs and prosperity don't trickle down from the top  they grow from a strong and thriving middle class  more tax breaks for outsourcers won't create jobs  it didn't over the last decade  you know what does create jobs  is supporting small businesses and manufacturers who make products right here in america  who hire american workers  that's what we're championing  that's why we need to stop rewarding companies that ship jobs overseas  start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in miami  right here in florida  right here in the united states  that's the choice you face in this election  i believe we can create more jobs by controlling more of our own energy  after   years of inaction  we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade  your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  and today  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in two decades  so now you've got a choice  my plan would cut our oil imports in half and invest in the clean energy that's creating thousands of jobs all across america right now not just oil and natural gas  but wind and solar and clean coal technologies and fuel efficient cars and long lasting batteries  and if you want to know how we're paying for it  one of the things we need to do is not allow oil companies to collect another   billion in taxpayer funded corporate welfare every single year  i will not let china or anybody else win the race for clean energy technology  i want to see that technology developed right here in florida  right here in the united states of america  creating jobs right here  and by the way  yes  my plan will reduce the carbon pollution that's heating our planet  because climate change is not a hoax  more drought and floods and hurricanes and wildfires that's not a joke  that's a threat to our children's future  and we can do something about it  just like i believe that we can make sure that every young person in america gets the education they need to compete  education is the only reason that i'm standing here today  education is the gateway to a middle class life  and now you've got a choice  governor romney says hiring more teachers won't grow the economy over the next   years  that's not the role of teachers  what about our kids over the next   years  what about our economy over the next   years  we cannot gut education to pay for   trillion tax cuts  we need to recruit   new math and science teachers and provide   million workers the opportunity to study at community colleges and lower tuition costs for our young people  that's what we're fighting for  that's what's at stake in this election  that's what grows our economy  that's what we can do together  and that's what you can choose for america   i audience member i  i love you  barack   i the president i  i love you back  i want to use the money that we're saving from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan to pay down our deficit  put our people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools all across america  governor romney said it was  tragic  to end the war in iraq  he said this in a speech just this week said we should have left troops on the ground in iraq   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  i think bringing our troops home to their families was the right thing to do  and every brave american who wears the uniform of this country should know  as long as i'm your commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world's ever known  and when our troops take off their uniforms  we will serve them as well as they've served us  because nobody who's fought for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  and finally  yes  we're going to need to cut our deficit by   trillion over the next   years  and i've already worked with republicans and democrats to cut a trillion dollars in spending  i'm ready to do more  but we're not going to be able to get it done unless we also ask the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on their incomes over   the same rate we had when bill clinton was president and our economy created nearly   million new jobs  that's what we need to do  governor romney has a different view  he said just a couple weeks ago that it's fair that he pays a lower tax rate than a teacher who is making   a year   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  he's wrong  i refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i refuse to pay for that tax cut by asking students at  the u  to pay more for college or kicking children out of head start programs or eliminating health insurance for millions of americans who are poor or elderly or disabled  that won't help us grow  my opponent says over and over that he can cut taxes  increase military spending  close the deficit  but the only thing he's pointed to that he's going to get rid of is big bird   i laughter i  this week he said  don't worry  his new tax cuts will pay for themselves  that may not sound familiar to some of you guys because you're young  but we heard that exact same argument back in   back in   back in   that's how we went from surplus to deficit  we have heard this pitch before  we know it doesn't work  we know our plan does  this is the choice that we now face  this is what the election comes down to  this is why i'm running for a second term as president   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  over and over  folks like governor romney and his allies in congress tell us that since government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing sort of a you're on your own philosophy  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if a company is releasing harmful  toxic pollution into the air that your kids breathe  well  you know  that's the price of progress  if you can't afford to start a business or go to college  borrow money from your parents   i laughter i  that's not how we built this country  that's not what made america great  that's not who we are  that's not what we're about  here in america  we believe we're all in this together  we understand that america is not about what can be done for us  it's about what can be done by us  together  as one nation and one people  and that's what we came together to restore back in   that sense of what we can do together  and the american people all across this country responded  you are the reason that florida seniors right now are saving an average of   every year on prescription drugs because we passed obamacare  because we passed health care reform  you did that  you're the reason there's a working family from hollywood that was able to save their home from foreclosure  you did that  it's because of you  you're the reason that students in gainesville or tallahassee or here at  the u  have help paying for their college education  why veterans can go to college now on the new gi bill  you're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home  you're the reason why soldiers won't be kicked out of our military because of who they love  you're the reason why thousands of families have been able to say to the loved ones who served them so served us so bravely   welcome home  welcome home  and so we can't be tired now  we have to keep going  if you turn away now  if you buy into the cynicism that what we fought for isn't possible  well  of course change won't happen  if you give up on the idea that your voice makes a difference  especially the young people here  then other voices will fill the void  the lobbyists and the special interests  the people with the   million checks who are trying to buy this election  the ones who are trying to make it harder to vote  the washington politicians who want to control health care choices women can make for themselves  they will fill the void  they will set the agenda  and they will take us backward  and only you can make sure that doesn't happen  only you have the power to move us forward  on october   you can choose  you can choose  you can choose whether we go back to the policies that got us into this mess  or you can choose to keep moving forward with policies that have been getting us out of this mess  that's the choice  on october   you can choose to go back to a foreign policy that takes us into wars with no plan to get out  or we can say let's keep moving forward  let's end the afghan war realistically  let's bring our troops home in a responsible fashion  on october   you can agree to turn back the clock   years for women and immigrants and gays and lesbians  or you can stand up and say we want to keep moving forward  i believe that america is a country where you can succeed no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter who you love  that's what's at stake  that's what's at stake in this election  that's why i'm asking for your vote   i audience members i  you got it   i the president i  you know  on back in   i won  but   percent of the country didn't vote for me  but i didn't just dismiss   percent of the country  what i said was  you may not have voted for me  but i heard your voices  and i'll fight just as hard for you as i will for everybody else  and i've kept that promise  i have been fighting for every american to make sure they get a fair shot  and i have been willing to do it and able to do it because every single day the american people have inspired me  i still believe in you  and i need you to keep believing in me  i need you to help me finish the job  and if you're willing to stand with me and work with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls for me  we'll win florida again  we'll win this election  we'll finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  ohio  how's it going  bobcats  are you fired up  are you ready to go  boy  this is a good crowd  it's a big crowd and a good looking crowd  the weather is perfect  who arranged the weather   i audience members i   i inaudible i   i the president   i good job   i laughter i  can everybody please give a big round of applause for shannon for the great introduction  please give a round of applause to my great friend  your former governor  ted strickland is in the house  and your outstanding mayor  paul wiehl  is here  and of course  all of you are here  i came here today because i heard you've got a pretty fun football team to watch  undefeated  if i'm not mistaken  a shot at the mac championship  maybe a bcs bid  i just want to point out that i was pushing for a playoff system  we got a playoff system  one more promise kept  for those of you who are following college football   i laughter i  but it is outstanding the bobcats are doing so well  so i want to wish you guys luck in the upcoming season  i also came here today  ohio  because i want your vote   i applause i  i want your vote  i am not too proud to beg  i want you to vote  and the good news is  you can vote in ohio right now  find out where at vote barackobama com  if you live nearby  you can vote just a few blocks away at   south court street   i applause i    south court street  everybody knows where that is  if not  find out  i know a bunch of folks are meeting there at   p m  tomorrow to vote together  so what do you say  ohio  can you grab some friends  go vote  go vote  see  my assumption is if you're here  you're going to vote  so you've got to go back to your dorm  grab that guy who's sitting there eating chips  watching sportscenter   i laughter i  tell him he's got to vote too   i audience member i  i love you  barack   i the president i  i love you back  now  we had our second presidential debate last night  i'm still trying to get the hang of this thing   i laughter i  but there are a couple of things that i noticed that keeps on recurring in this debate and during the course of this campaign  governor romney continues to run around talking about his five point plan for the economy   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  wait  wait  wait  don't boo  vote  but as we saw last night  the five point plan really boils down to one point  folks at the very top get to play by a different set of rules than you do  so they can pay lower taxes  they can use offshore accounts  they can buy a company  load it up with debt  lay off the workers  strip away the pensions  send the jobs overseas  and still make a big profit doing it  it's the same philosophy that's been squeezing middle class families for over a decade  it's the same philosophy that got us into this mess  and i have seen too much pain and struggle here in ohio and all across the country to let us go down that path again  we cannot grow this economy from the top down  we grow it from the middle out  we're not going backwards  we're going forward  that's why i'm running for a second term for president  and that's why i want your vote  so he's trying to sell you on this five point plan  then  he tries to take another stab at trying to sell you on his   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy  he says  it's not going to raise the deficit  i'm going to lower taxes for middle class folks  we're not going to  in any way  give a tax break to the well to do folks  even though he said during the republican primary he was going to cut taxes for the top   percent  then  when you ask him  all right  if you're going to pay for all this  how are you going to pay for it  couldn't tell you  said he was going to pay for it by cutting planned parenthood and big bird   i audience members i  no   i the president i  that's what he said  and then  when you keep on pressing him  he says  i said i was going to do it  i was a businessman  so you should just take my word for it  now  here's a tip  when a politician tells you that he's going to tell you what he's going to do after the election  but he can't tell you now  it's not because the plan is so good that he doesn't want to let you in on it  it's not because he wants to give you this great surprise later on  it's because he knows it won't work  everybody who has looked at this tax plan of his says he can't pay for it without either blowing up the deficit or by raising taxes on middle class families   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  so then  governor romney says  well  i've got a plan to create   million jobs in the next   years   i audience member i  in china   i laughter i   i the president i  my guy here said   in china   i laughter i  now  when folks started going through these numbers  his jobs plan fell apart even faster than his tax plan  the washington post called it bait and switch bait and switch  i mean  here's a guy whose part of his tax plan is to give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  he's invested in companies that were called  pioneers  of outsourcing  does that sound like a   million job plan to you   i audience members i  no   i the president i  that's the right answer   i laughter i  so let's recap here  he's got a tax plan that doesn't add up  he's got a jobs plan that doesn't create jobs  he's got a deficit plan that doesn't reduce the deficit  you've heard of the new deal  ohio  you've heard of the fair deal  mitt romney's trying to sell you a sketchy deal  but we're not buying it  we know better  because this is the same sketchy deal that we were sold back in the previous administration  we tried it  it didn't work  we're not going back  we're moving forward  i need you to finish what we started  that's why i'm asking for your vote  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  then  last night the issue of keeping promises came up  so i had to remind people    years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  and i did  i said we'd end the war in afghanistan  and we are  i said we'd refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on   and bin laden is dead  four years ago  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  and we have  by   i promised to cut taxes for small business owners  and we have   times  i said we'd put an end to taxpayer funded bailouts  we got every dime back that we used to rescue the banks  and we passed a law to end those bailouts for good  as shannon just told you  i promised to pass health reform so that your insurance companies can't jerk you around  so that young people can stay on their parent's plan until they're   so that people with preexisting conditions can get health insurance  so that women aren't being charged for men for the same insurance  i promised we'd repeal  don't ask  don't tell  because my attitude is anybody who's willing to serve our military and sacrifice for us  it shouldn't matter who they love  when governor romney said we should let detroit go bankrupt  we said  thanks  but no thanks  we won't take your vast business advice  we're going to support the auto industry  we're going to bet on american workers and because we knew that one in eight ohio jobs is supported by the auto industry  and that industry has come roaring back to the top of the world  four years ago  i said i would do everything i could  every single day  to dig us out of the hole we were left  and because of the incredible resilience of the american people    years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  we are moving forward again  we were losing   jobs a month  now we've added more than   million new jobs  more manufacturing jobs than any time since the  s  the unemployment rate has fallen from   percent to   percent  foreclosures are their lowest in   years  home values are on the rise  stock market has doubled  manufacturing is coming back  assembly lines are putting folks back to work  that's what we've been fighting for  those are the promises i've kept  now  for all the progress we've made  we've got more work to do  there are too many folks out there still looking for work  there are too many folks out there who are still having trouble paying the bills  and that's why we've got to keep moving forward to build on what we've already done  yesterday i talked about a concrete  specific plan to create jobs  to create more security for the middle class  it starts  number one  with building on the manufacturing progress we've already made  let's stop outsourcing jobs  let's export products stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's what we need to do  so mitt romney wants to keep giving those tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to end them  i want to invest in companies that are building right here  building plants  hiring workers  making products in athens  in ohio  in the united states of america  you can make that happen  i want to control our own energy  you know  after   years where we hadn't done anything  we are now going to be producing cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  which means that saves you money  but it also means we are reducing our dependence on foreign oil  and we're also investing in the energy sources of tomorrow  wind and solar and biofuels  clean coal technology  today america is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in two decades  so governor romney wants to reverse this progress  we want to build on it  instead of giving we give   billion a year to oil companies corporate welfare  you pay for it  they're already making money every time you go to the pump  so i'm saying let's take that money i don't want china to win the race for new technologies and new energy  let's invest here in the united states in developing that technology  and by the way  we can by doing this  we can also reduce the problem of carbon pollution and we can still invest in clean coal technology  i was listening to governor romney yesterday talk about how he's a champion of coal  when he was a governor  stood in front of a coal fired plant and said  this plant kills people  and now he's running around talking like he's mr  coal   i laughter i  come on  come on  you know that's not on the level  does anybody actually look at that guy and think  man  he's really into coal   i laughter i  did you see when he was doing that ad  he's in front of all these miners with hard hats  found out later  they had to come  boss made them come   i laughter i  come on  got to be on the level if you want to be president of the united states  i want to give more americans the chance to learn the skills they need in the  st century economy  look  i'm only here because i got a good education  i wasn't born into fame or fortune  and nobody was picking  boy  that guy barack obama  he's going to be president someday   i laughter i  but i got a great education  kid of a my mom was a single mom  she's working her way through school trying to raise me and my sister  but in america  we give everybody an opportunity  that's what this country is about  and i've never forgotten that  so one of the first things we did was to make sure let's stop giving banks and lenders billions of dollars as middlemen for the student loan program  let's cut out the middlemen and give the money directly to students  that's how we kept your student loan interest rates low  that's how we expanded pell grants  that's why we've set up a system where students  if they have debt  they're never going to have to pay more than   percent of their income  if they choose to become a teacher or do something that doesn't pay a lot of money  they can still manage the debt from getting an outstanding education  so now you've got a choice  ohio  governor romney  he says hiring more teachers  that doesn't help the economy grow  you know what  he's wrong  it will  and think about all those kids right now who are in overcrowded classrooms or don't have a computer science lab  they're only going to be in third grade once or juniors in high school once  if they miss those opportunities now  they may not make it up later  so we could you can take governor romney's advice and give a   trillion tax cut and pay for it by cutting education or   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  or we can recruit   new math and science teachers  put them to work right now  that's where the jobs are of the future  it should be a national mission to make sure that all our young people are getting an education in some of these fields where we know there are going to be jobs  and by the way  we want our sons in that  but we also want our daughters  i don't know if you were listening last night  but  see  we don't have to order up some binders i laughter i to find qualified  talented  driven young women to learn and teach and thrive and start businesses  and when these young women graduate  we should make a very simple concept the rule  equal pay for equal work   i applause i  equal pay for equal work  i've got two daughters  i don't want them paid less than a man for doing the same job  and by the way  men out there  you don't want your wives paid less than a man for the same job  so this isn't just a women's issue  this is a family issue  this is a middle class issue  governor romney  for months  refused to say if he'd support the law that we signed that said equal pay for equal work  just today his campaign admitted  well  he's never weighed in on that  why not  what's so hard about weighing in on that  do you believe in equal pay for equal work  or you don't  i weighed in on it  because that was the first bill that i signed  the lilly ledbetter fair pay act  to make it easier for women to enforce their rights to get equal pay for equal work  i want to take some of the money that we are saving from ending the war in iraq and transitioning in afghanistan to pay down our deficit and put our folks to work right here doing some nation building here at home  building roads and bridges and schools  the next debate on monday is going to be about foreign policy  it will be interesting to hear what governor romney has to say  he said he thought it was  tragic  the way we ended the war in iraq  he said doubled down on this  said we should still have troops in iraq  just said this a couple weeks ago  i think that was a mistake  i think bringing our troops home after all the sacrifices they've made in a distant country  all the sacrifices their families have made  it is time to make sure that we're doing some nation building here at home  that's what i believe  and when our troops do come home and take off those uniforms  they need to know as long as i'm your commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military in the world and we will also make sure those troops get served as well as they've served us  nobody who fought for this country should ever have to fight for a job  or a roof over their heads  or the health care they've earned when they come home  that shouldn't happen   i applause i  that shouldn't happen  and finally  we need to cut the deficit and the debt  i know you the other side  they put up a lot of ads  they think that you've forgotten the fact that they fought two wars on a credit card and two tax cuts on a credit card and didn't pay for anything  said deficits didn't matter  they're like the guy who shows up at a restaurant  orders a big steak  has a big drink  orders a big piece of pie  then leaves before paying the tab  and then they say  oh  look  look at what obama did  it's like  what   i laughter i  you all had nothing to do with it  but look  we've got to do something about it  so what i've said look  i've already worked with republicans and democrats to cut a trillion dollars in spending  i'm ready to do more  but we can't get it done just by cutting education programs or cutting basic research programs that help us grow our economy  so what i've said is if we're doing some cutting  let's also make sure the wealthiest households pay a little bit more  pay higher taxes after your first   worth of income  go back to the rates bill clinton had when we created   million new jobs  when we went from deficit to surplus  governor romney has some different ideas  he was asked on   minutes some of you may have seen this is it fair for you  making   million a year  to pay a lower tax rate than a teacher making    i audience members i  no   i the president i  well  that's your answer  but that's not his answer  he said  yes  i think that's fair  said that's how you grow an economy  that's how we allocate capital  i say  well  no  i actually think it's not fair  especially when we've got to reduce the deficit  and i'm not going to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home  or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i'm not going to pay for that tax cut by making all the students here pay more for college or kicking kids off of head start or eliminating health insurance for millions of americans who are elderly or poor or disabled  i'm not going to turn medicare into a voucher system  we're not going to privatize social security  we've got to make choices  but let's make sure everybody has to make some sacrifices  not just a few  that's the choice you've got to make in this election  our opponents  they always tell us  well  government can't do everything  you want trickle down government  that was the phrase he's been using  no  i don't  i believe in free enterprise  i believe every one of the young people here  they're going to have to work for their success  they're going to have to earn it  i don't believe in handouts  but i also believe in a country where everybody has got a shot  where everybody has opportunity  these folks  they've got a you're on your own philosophy  can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  can't afford to start a business or go to college  borrow money from your parents   i laughter i  that's not what built this country  i talked last night about the fact  you know  my grandfather  he fought in patton's army in world war ii  he never he hadn't gone to college  right out of high school he joined the army  part of that greatest generation  when he came home  he was given a gi bill  a chance to go to college  and that wasn't a handout  that wasn't just good for him  that was good for the whole country  because suddenly  the whole country got a better education  and the whole country saw its incomes rise  and the whole country saw businesses grow  the whole country prospered  the whole country succeeded  that's the america we believe in  we believe in doing things for ourselves  but we also believe in doing some things together to make sure this country succeeds  and that's what the last campaign was about in   that's what this one is about  but it only happens because of you  you're the reason we've got a factory worker in toledo or lordstown who lost his job but now is back on the line building great cars  you did that  you're the reason students in akron or columbus or right here at ohio university  can get some help paying for their college  you're the reason why a veteran coming home suddenly has got a new gi bill that allows them to have a brighter future  you're the reason some young immigrant who grew up here and pledged allegiance to our flag is not going to be deported from the only country she's ever known  you're the reason that those who served us so bravely can finally hear those magic words and hug their loved ones and hear them say   welcome home   i applause i  welcome home  welcome home  that happened because of you  and only you have got the power to keep us moving forward  i can't do it by myself  i need you  i'm only in washington because of you  so you can choose the other guy  who wants to reinstitute the top down policies that got us into this mess  or you can help us move forward with the policies that are getting us out of this mess  you can choose a foreign policy that got us into wars with no plan of getting out  or you can say  no  we're going to turn the page  we're going to end the afghan war responsibly  we're going to bring our troops home  we're going to focus on the terrorists who would actually do us harm  you can turn back the clock on   years of progress for women and immigrants and gays and lesbians  or you can stand up and say  no  i want to move forward  in this election  you can say i want an america to remain a country where no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter who you are  who you love black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  gay  straight  able  disabled  it doesn't matter we're all americans  and we're going to move forward together  that's what's at stake in this election  that's why i'm asking for your vote  that's why i'm here today  ohio  i believe in you  and i need you to keep on believing in

thank you  thank you  hey  are you fired up  are you ready to go  well  first of all  can everybody please give a big round of applause to rachel for that great introduction  i want to thank the rams for hosting us here today  i appreciate you guys  go rams  we've got your outstanding senator tom harkin  congressman bruce braley  another congressman who has i guess it's professor emeritus right here dave loebsack  two of my oldest friends in iowa  my cochairs back in  your attorney general  tom miller and your treasurer  mike fitzgerald  and i'm thrilled to see all of you  and i hope you're enjoying the warm weather   i laughter i  because   i audience member i  i love you   i the president i  i love you back  because  i just want to know look  i'm from chicago  and i campaigned in iowa in january   i laughter i  so this is basically the warmest you will be for the next  months   i laughter i  now  i've come back to cornell college today  come back to ask each of you for one big thing  i'm asking for your vote   i applause i  i'm asking for your vote  in iowa  you can vote today  today  as long as you're registered before october   you can vote right up to election day  in fact  you can go vote right after this event at the cole library  so and anyone can find out how to register and where to vote at vote barackobama com  so  iowa  are you going to vote for me today if you haven't already voted  i need you   i applause i  i need you  now  as many of you know  we had our second debate last night  i'm still trying to figure out how to get the hang of this thing  debating   i laughter i  but we're working on it  we'll keep on improving as time goes on  i've got one left  but the interesting thing is that governor romney has been running around talking about his five point plan for the economy for quite some time  and as i pointed out last night  and you guys heard yourselves  it's really a one point plan  it's really a one point plan  it says folks at the very top can play by their own set of rules  that's why they can pay lower taxes than you do or they can use offshore accounts  or they can invest in a company  bankrupt it  fire the workers  take away their pensions  ship the jobs overseas  and still make money doing it  it's the one point plan that says it's okay for wall street to keep engaging in the reckless behavior that got us into the mess we've been fighting back from for the last   years  it's the same philosophy that's been squeezing middle class families for more than a decade  it's the same philosophy that we saw in the previous administration  and i have seen too much pain and too much struggle to let this country go down that same road again  so  iowa  we can't i want you to know  folks here in iowa understand this you cannot grow this economy from the top down  you grow this economy from the middle class out  we're not going to go back to what we were doing before  we're moving forward  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  now  governor romney also took another stab at trying to sell us his   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy  once again  he refused to tell us how he's going to pay for it  he said he'd let you know after the election   i laughter i  now  here's a tip  usually when a politician tells you he's going to wait until after the election to explain a plan to you  they don't have a pleasant surprise in store for you   i laughter i  and in this case  it's because just about everybody who's looked at governor romney's   trillion in tax cuts says he can't pay for it without blowing a hole in the deficit or raising taxes on middle class families  it can't be done  governor romney says he has a plan to create   million new jobs in the next   years  but when folks started crunching the numbers  it fell apart even faster than his tax plan   i laughter i  turns out his jobs math isn't any better than his tax math  the washington post called it a  bait and switch  so let's recap what we learned last night  his tax plan doesn't add up  his jobs plan doesn't create jobs  his deficit reduction plan adds to the deficit  so  iowa  everybody here has heard of the new deal  you've heard of the fair deal  you've heard of the square deal  mitt romney is trying to sell you a sketchy deal  we are not buying it  we know better  we've been there  we've tried that  we're not going back  we're moving forward  that's why i need your vote  we've got to finish what we started in   you don't want to invest in that sketchy deal  let me tell you   i audience member i  etch a sketch   i the president i  that too   i laughter i  four years ago  i told you we'd end the war in iraq  and i did  i said we'd end the war in afghanistan  and we are  i said we'd focus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on   and we have  and bin laden is dead  four years ago  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  and we have  by   i promised to cut taxes for small business owners  and we have   times  we got back every dime used to rescue the banks  and we passed a law to make sure that taxpayer funded bailouts are over for good  we passed health care reform so your insurance company can't jerk you around anymore  we made sure insurance companies have to let parents keep their children on their parents' plan until they're   years old if they don't have health insurance  we said to insurance companies  you've got to charge women the same as men because being a woman is not a preexisting condition  we repealed  don't ask  don't tell  so no one is ever kicked out of the military because of who they love  when governor romney said we should just let detroit go bankrupt  we said thanks but no thanks  and we reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top of the world  last time i was here  i said to students  we're going to help you make sure you can afford a college education  and we took   billion that was going to banks and middlemen in the student loan program  we said let's cut out the middleman  let's give that money directly to students  and as a consequence  millions of students have benefited from lower interest rates and pell grants  today    years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  we're moving forward again  after losing   jobs a month when i took office  our businesses have now added more than   million new jobs over the past   years  unemployment has fallen from a peak of   percent to   percent  the stock market has nearly doubled  which means your  k s have started to recover  foreclosures are at their lowest point in   years  home values are back on the rise  manufacturing is coming home to america  our assembly lines are starting to hum again  look  we've got a lot more work to do  but we've got to build on that progress  and i've got a plan to grow the economy and create jobs and build more security for middle class families  i talked about it last night  i want to export more products  outsource fewer jobs  we can keep giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  or we can give those tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in iowa  right here in the united states of america  rebuilding our manufacturing base  i want to control more of our own energy  you heard last night  oil production is up  natural gas production is up  but what we've also said is we've got to develop new sources of energy  and we've got to be more efficient with our economy  and so we raised fuel efficiency standards on cars so by the middle of the next decade  your car will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  we have doubled the amount of renewable energy that we generate from wind and solar and biofuels  today  the united states of america is less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last two decades  and so the question i applause i  so the choice you have  you heard last night  it's not a choice between oil versus solar or natural gas versus wind  look  we all agree we got to increase oil production  we all agree we got to increase natural gas production  but the question is whether we build on the progress for the new energy sources of the future  i'm not going to keep on giving corporate  taxpayer funded welfare to oil companies    billion a year  when we could be using that money to continue to promote wind and solar and long lasting batteries  and put americans back to work right now  seeing that technology develop here in the united states instead of china or germany or some other country  and i've got to tell you  iowa  this is not a pipedream  there are nearly   jobs in iowa right now depending on wind energy  last night governor romney claimed he didn't have a plan to end wind jobs in iowa  but he called these jobs  imaginary  his plan would end tax credits for wind energy producers  that is a fact  my plan will keep these investments  and we'll keep reducing the carbon pollution that's also heating the planet  because climate change isn't a hoax  the droughts we've seen  the floods  the wildfires  those aren't a joke  they're a threat to our children's future  and we can do something about it  that's part of what's at stake in this election  i want to give more americans the chance to get a great education and get the skills they need to compete in the  st century  i tried to talk about education last night  we kept on getting waylaid  but if you're talking about jobs and economic growth  what's more important than making sure everybody has got the skills they need  i'm only here because of a great education  all the young people who are making an investment in their college education right now  you guys understand you've got to be equipped  michelle  her gateway into the middle into opportunity was her education system  her dad was a blue collar worker  her mom was a secretary  and right now  as i said  because of the actions we already took  millions of young people are paying less for college because we finally took on that system that was wasting taxpayer dollars  gave it directly to students  rachel  by the way  i took a photo with her parents backstage  and she talked about how the fact that we put in place a tax credit for middle income families to send their kids to college is helping her attend school right now  but what you saw last night  even though we weren't able to talk about it as much as i would have liked  is a fundamental difference  governor romney says hiring more teachers won't grow our economy over the next   years  well  you know what  yes  it will  but more importantly  what about our kids over the next   years  what about our economy for the next   years  we could gut education  pay for governor romney's   trillion tax cut  or we can recruit   new math and science teachers over the next decade  helping our young people refocus on science and technology  engineering  math  we should make sure all our young people our daughters as well as our sons are thriving in these fields  this should be a national mission  i've got to tell you  we don't have to collect a bunch of binders to find qualified  talented  driven young women ready to learn and teach in these fields right now  and when young women graduate  they should get equal pay for equal work  that should be a simple question to answer  when governor romney was asked about it  his campaign said  we'll get back to you  that shouldn't be a complicated question  equal pay for equal work  i want my daughters paid just like somebody else's sons are paid for the same job  that's straightforward  now  i've got to say  last night governor romney's top advisor finally admitted  no  the governor didn't really support that bill  you don't have to wait for an answer from me  the lilly ledbetter fair pay act was the first bill i signed into law as president the first bill  governor romney didn't want to talk much last night about how he wants to end funding for planned parenthood  how he supports legislation that would turn certain decisions about a woman's health care over to their employers  he didn't want to talk about it because he knows he can't sell it  i don't think your boss should control the health care you get  i don't think insurers should control the health care you get  i certainly don't think politicians should control the health care that you get  we passed obamacare yes  i like the term we passed it i laughter i because i do care  and i want to put these choices in your hands where they belong  fourth plan fourth part of the plan to create jobs right here is use some of the money we're saving from ending those wars in iraq  winding down the war in afghanistan  to pay down our deficit  put our people back to work  including our veterans  rebuilding roads and bridges and schools all across america  governor romney and i just have a different theory on this  he said it was  tragic  the way we ended the war in iraq  doubled down on the belief in a speech just last week  said we should have kept troops on the ground in iraq  i disagree  i know these troops  i know their families  i know how dedicated they are and the sacrifices they and their families make  and it was time to bring those troops home to their families  it was the right thing to do  and every brave american who wears the uniform of this country  they need to know  as long as i'm commander in chief  we're going to maintain the strongest military in the world  and when those troops take off the uniform  we're going to serve them as well as they served us  because nobody should have to fight for a job after they fought for our country  nobody should have to fight for a roof over their heads or the health care they need after they fought for america  and finally  i want to cut the deficit by   trillion over the next   years  and i've worked with republicans and democrats already to cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending  i'm ready to cut more spending that is not contributing to our growth  but we can't just cut our way to prosperity  we've got to make investments in science and research and infrastructure  and we can't do all that and reduce our deficit unless we ask the wealthiest households to pay a little bit more  pay higher taxes on incomes over   so keep in mind  somebody making   they're still keeping the tax break for the first   but after that  let's go back to the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  our economy created   million new jobs  we went from deficit to surplus  governor romney was asked  is it fair that he pays a lower tax rate than a teacher who makes   he said  yes  i think it's fair  i think that's how you grow an economy  he's wrong  there's the you look at our economic history  that's not how we grew an economy  by just having a few folks at the top paying even less than folks in the middle  i'm not going to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home  or raising their kids  or sending their kids to college just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i'm not going to ask the students here to pay more for college so i have a little more money in my pocket  i don't need it  i'm not going to kick children out of head start programs  or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans who are poor  or elderly  or disabled  and governor romney again last night  over and over again  he says  i can cut taxes for everybody  i can increase military spending by   trillion  i will lower taxes for middle class families and i'm going to close the deficit  he keeps on saying it  and when people ask  well  what are you going to cut  because i don't know about you guys  but if i'm looking at my budget and i'm trying to shrink my debt  i've got to cut something out  so so far  what he's offered is eliminating funding for planned parenthood and getting rid of big bird   i audience members i  boo   i the president   i and ending wind tax credits   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  it adds up to less than  th of   percent of the federal budget  so he claims his now  that was an estimate  by the way  i was doing that off the top of my head   i laughter i  he claims his   trillion tax cut will create millions of new jobs and pay for themselves  we have heard this pitch before  you know where we heard it  in the previous administration  we know it doesn't work  we know what we're talking about does create jobs  and now the choice is up to you  the election now is up to you  it comes down to this  over and over again  our opponents tell us that because government can't do everything  it should do almost nothing  if you can't afford health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if you can't afford to start a business or go to college  borrow money from your parents  if a company releases harmful pollution into the air  you know what  that's the price of progress  that's not who we are  that's not what america is about  we are in this thing together  that's what this country is about  here in america  we believe that we're all in this together  everybody  we understand  america is not just about what can be done for us  but what can be done by us  as one people  as one nation  iowa  you're the reason that we've got shuttered factories in places like newton that are now humming again with workers manufacturing components for amazing wind turbines  you made that happen because you believed we could do this together  you're the reason a mother in cedar rapids actually  a mother right here in this audience doesn't have to worry about surgery for her daughter because the insurance company can't limit her coverage  you're the reason a student in ames or iowa city or cornell college can get help paying for a college education and we've got a new gi bill for our returning veterans to get the education they need  that all happened because of you  and we've got to do it again  you're the reason a young immigrant is not going to be sent away from the only country she's ever called home  you're the reason that we were able to bring our troops home and those families are reunited with their loved ones  you made that happen  so if we don't fight as hard as we can over the next   weeks  all that could be set aside  that's what we're fighting for  that's what we're fighting for  that's what we're fighting for  you cannot turn away  and if your voices aren't heard  then the lobbyists and the special interests  they'll fill the void  the folks who are writing the   million checks to try to buy this election  the folks who are trying to make it harder for people to vote in this election  and you can't let that happen  i'm not going to let that happen  we've worked too hard together over the last   years to let that happen  back in   it started here in iowa  you're the ones who first showed america that change was possible  and everything we fought for is now at stake  and we can choose to go back to the same top down policies that got us into this mess  or you can choose to move us forward with the policies that have been getting us out of this mess  you can choose to go back to a foreign policy that gets us into wars with no plan for getting out  or you can help move us forward and end the afghan war responsibly and bring our troops home and focus on the terrorists who were going to attack us  you can choose to turn back the clock   years for women and for immigrants and for gays and for lesbians  or you can stand up and say  we want to move forward  we believe in the country where no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or who you love  you can make it if you try  that's what's at stake in this election  that's what i still believe in  and if that's what you still believe in  then we've got to fight as hard as we can for the next   weeks  and i promise you  if you are willing to stand with me and knock on doors with me and work as hard as you can  and talk to your friends and your neighbors and your classmates  and if you will vote for me  we will win linn county again  we will win iowa again  we will win this election again  we'll finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  new hampshire  are you fired up   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  are you ready to go   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  i'm fired up  first of all  i'm fired up about this weather  i mean  i've got to say that generally when i look at a trip to new hampshire in october  i'm not thinking it's going to look like this  but this is spectacular  it's good to be back  and it's good to be with a great friend and an outstanding governor  governor lynch  please give him a big round of applause   i audience member i  i love you   i the president i  i love you back  and i love your outstanding senator  jeanne shaheen  jeanne was especially happy because it was her granddaughter elle who sang the national anthem today  give elle a big round of applause  nineteen days  new hampshire   i applause i  nineteen days  in   days  you're going to step into a voting booth  and you've got a big choice to make  it's not just a choice between two candidates or parties  it's about two different visions for this country that we love  governor romney's got his sales pitch  he's been running around talking about his five point powerpoint plan for the economy   i laughter i  but as we saw the other night  it's not a five point i applause i what he's selling is not a five point plan  it's really just a one point plan  folks at the top get to play with a different set of rules than you do   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  now  vote  they can pay lower taxes  they can keep their money offshore  they can buy companies  load it up with debt  lay off workers  strip their pensions  send their jobs overseas  they can still make money doing it  turning a big profit  it's the same philosophy that's been squeezing middle class families for more than a decade  it's the same philosophy that got us into this mess  for the last   years  i've watched the american people  with their resilience and resolve  overcoming the pain and struggle and dealing with the consequences of the worst financial crisis since the great depression  we've worked too hard to let this country go down that path again   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  new hampshire  we cannot grow this economy from the top down  this economy grows from the middle out  when everybody has ladders of opportunity  if they work hard  they can succeed  they can get ahead  that's how we move ahead  and when workers have a decent living  have a little money in their pockets  that means they're out there as customers buying goods  and that means businesses do better  and that means businesses make more profits  then they hire more workers  that's how you grow an economy  that's why we can't go backward  that's why we've got to move forward  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  on tuesday  governor romney took another stab at trying to sell us this   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy  he took another swing at it  and he whiffed  instead of telling us how he'd pay for it  he said  i'll let you know after the election   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  and then when i asked him about it  he said  i'm a businessman  i know the numbers will work  take my word for it  now  here i'm going to let you in on a little tip  when a politician tells you he's going to wait until after the election  it's not because their plan is so good that they don't want to spoil the secret   i laughter i  that's usually not what's going on  and in this case  just about everybody who's looked at his tax plan says he can't pay for it without blowing a hole in the deficit  or raising your taxes  raising taxes on the middle class   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  so then governor romney says he's got another plan to create   million jobs in the next   years  but when folks started crunching the numbers  his jobs plan fell apart even faster than his tax plan  the washington post called it a bait and switch  a bait and switch  so let's recap  he's got a tax plan that doesn't add up  he's got a jobs plan that doesn't create jobs  he's got a deficit plan that doesn't reduce the deficit  listen  new hampshire  you've heard of the new deal  you've heard of the square deal and the fair deal  mitt romney is trying to sell you a sketchy deal  we don't need a sketchy deal  we know better  because the last time this sketchy deal was tried was in the previous administration  made the same sales pitch  told you the same stuff  look  if we cut these taxes  the economy is going to grow so much  the deficit is going to come down  don't worry about it  just like they said we didn't have to pay for two wars  it didn't work  and that's why you're not buying it  we have been there  we've tried it  we're not going back  we're moving forward  i need your help to finish what we started in   now  i made some commitments   years ago  i told you i'd end the war in iraq  and we did  i said we'd end the war in afghanistan  we are  i said we'd refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on   and we have  and today  a new tower rises above the new york skyline  and al qaida is on the path to defeat  and usama bin laden is dead  four years ago  i promised to cut middle class taxes  and we have  by   i promised to cut taxes for small business owners  and we have   times  and by the way  you'll hear governor romney talk about small businesses  what he doesn't tell you is his definition of small businesses includes donald trump i laughter i includes hedge fund managers   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  we got back every dime used to rescue the banks  and then we passed a law to end taxpayer funded wall street bailouts for good  we put that in place  four years ago  i said in this great country of ours  nobody should go bankrupt when they get sick  and so we passed health reform yes  i like the name obamacare so your insurance companies can't jerk you around anymore  so young people can stay on their parents' plans until they're   so women can't be charged more than men for their insurance  being a woman is not a preexisting condition  we repealed  don't ask  don't tell  because anybody who is willing to sacrifice and serve this country we love shouldn't be prevented because of who they love  when governor romney said we should let detroit go bankrupt  we said  no  thanks  we're not going to take that business advice   i laughter i  we reinvented a dying auto industry that's come roaring back to the top of the world  and you may have heard  by the way  in the debate governor romney trying to claim that i did what he advised   i audience members i  no   i the president i  did you hear that   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  unbelievable   i laughter i   i the president i  everybody in the auto industry knows that's not what he said  he just went ahead and said it  today    years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes  we're moving forward again  after losing   jobs a month when i took office  our businesses have added more than   million new jobs over the past   years  unemployment has fallen from   percent to   percent  home values are back on the rise  the stock market's nearly doubled  manufacturing is coming home  our assembly lines are getting back to work  we need to keep moving forward  we've got more work to do  that's why i'm running for a second term   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  so i've look  we have more work to do though  i will not be satisfied until everybody who wants to work hard can find a job  and that means we've got to have a plan to grow not just the economy and create jobs  but create good jobs and provide security for the middle class  so  number one  i want to send fewer jobs overseas  sell more products overseas  we governor romney has no problem giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas or outsourcing  but i want to reward companies that are investing right here  investing in new hampshire  investing in manchester  insourcing  opening new plants  hiring new workers  creating new jobs right here in america  that's what we need to do  i want to control more of our own energy and how we use energy  after   years of doing nothing  we raised fuel standards so by the middle of the next decade your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  we've doubled the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar  even as we've increased the production of oil and natural gas  so today  america is less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last two decades  think about that  our oil imports are going down  so now you've got a choice between a plan that reverses this progress or one that builds on it  governor romney feels comfortable with taxpayers providing oil companies   billion a year in taxpayer funded corporate welfare   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't   i audience members i  vote  vote   i the president i  we're not going to boo  we're going to vote  but you know what  i understand why you wouldn't be happy with that idea  because we should be taking that   billion and investing it in the energy sources of tomorrow  right  we don't want china to win the race for clean energy technology  we want that technology developed here in the united states of america  and by the way  those investments not only create good jobs here at home  create new industries here at home  but it also reduces the carbon pollution that's heating our planet  climate change is not a hoax  droughts and floods and fires  they're not a joke  they are a threat to our children's future  and we've got to deal with it in a serious way that also grows our economy  we can do that  number three  i want the best education system in the world right here in the united states  michelle and i are only where we are because of the chance an education gave us  and today  because of the actions my administration took  millions of students all across the country are paying less for college  we took a system that was wasting tens of billions of dollars on banks and lenders  we said let's cut out the middleman  give the money directly to the students  and as a consequence  young people are getting a better deal  now  governor romney wants to reverse some of these choices  he wants to gut some of our investment in education to pay help pay for this   trillion tax cut  i think we should make sure that we are doing more in education  hiring new math and science teachers so that they can get the lead in the technology that's going to shape our economy in the future  provide job training for   million more workers at community colleges  work with colleges and universities to keep tuition low  that's my agenda for change  that's what we need to do  we can have that future  but you've got to vote  that's why i'm running for a second term  i know i suspect we've got some teachers in the audience  governor romney said hiring more teachers won't grow our economy  then he said class size doesn't matter  he said class size doesn't matter  there's not a teacher or a parent who doesn't believe this  making sure that our kids are thriving in math and science where we know there are going to be more jobs that will grow our economy  having them as be able to get a job as an engineer maybe start the next apple or the next intel  that will create jobs  that should be a national mission  that's what we're fighting for  and by the way  we want our sons to thrive in math and science and engineering  but we also want our daughters to thrive in those fields too  see  we don't have to order up some binders to find qualified  talented  driven young women who can learn and excel in these fields right now  and when these young women graduate  i want them to receive equal pay for equal work  i don't know why this is so complicated   i laughter i  governor romney still won't say whether or not he supported a law to protect that right  no matter how many times he's asked  this is not that hard  i've got two daughters  i want to make sure they get paid the same as somebody's sons for doing the same job  pretty straightforward  any confusion there   i audience members i  no   i the president i  you know where i stand  look  the lilly ledbetter fair pay act  this was the first bill i signed into law  and i know you want the same thing for your daughters  or sisters  or moms  or grandmas as i do  and this is not as i said in the debate  this is not just a women's issue  this is a family issue  this is an economic issue  i also believe women should make their own health care decisions  i know you've got and it's not just washington that sometimes deals with this issue  you've got a state legislature up here that sometimes acts like it knows better than women when it comes to women's own health care decisions  my opponent has got the same approach  governor romney said he'd end funding for planned parenthood  despite all the work it does to provide women with mammograms and breast cancer screenings   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote   i audience members i  vote  vote  vote   i the president i  all right  you guys are getting it  you guys are getting it   i laughter i  he supports we made sure that insurance companies are providing women with contraception  he supported legislation that would turn those decisions over to a woman's employer  think about that  do you think  like  your boss or your insurance company or some politician in concord or washington should get control of your health care choices   i audience members i  no   i the president i  the health care law we passed puts those choices in your hands where they belong  that's where they're going to stay as long as i'm president of the united states  as long as you vote   i audience members i  vote  vote  vote   i the president i  all right  now  we also have to make sure that we're using the money we're saving from ending the war in iraq  winding down the war in afghanistan  to put our people back to work here doing some nation building here at home  we got a debate on monday on foreign policy  and i'm very interested in seeing what governor romney has to say about this   i laughter i  you know  he said that it was  tragic  the way i ended the war in iraq  last week  he said we should still have troops in iraq   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  vote  vote   i laughter i   i audience members i  vote  vote  vote   i the president i  look  one of the great honors of my job is serving as commander in chief and meeting the amazing men and women in our armed services who serve us every single day  i think bringing our troops home after doing the job they did in iraq was the right thing to do  reuniting them with their families was the right thing to do  the   troops that we've brought home this year from afghanistan  that was the right thing to do  and every brave american who wears this country's uniform should know this  as long as i'm your commander in chief  i will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  and when you take off that uniform  we're going to serve you as well as you've served us  because nobody who has fought for us should ever have to fight for a job when they come home or a roof over their heads when they come home or the benefits they've earned when they come home  all right  and finally  we've got to cut the deficit by   trillion over the next   years  i've put forward a plan to do it  and i've worked with the republicans and democrats already to cut spending that we didn't need or we couldn't afford  and i'm ready to do more  but i'm not going to cut things like education  i'm not going to cut research that helps grow our economy  we can't get this done unless we also ask the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on their incomes above   pay the same rate we had when bill clinton was president  we created   million new jobs  and we went from a deficit to surplus  that's how you do it  governor romney said he thinks it's fair that he pays a lower tax rate than a teacher who makes    i audience members i  boo   i audience members i  vote  vote  vote   i the president i  vote  he is wrong  i'm not going to ask middle class families to give up your deductions on a home mortgage or your deductions for raising a kid just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i'm not going to ask students who are here to pay more for college or kick kids out of head start or eliminate health insurance for millions of americans just to pay for a tax we don't need tax cut we don't need  that's not who we are  that's not what we're about  governor romney and  frankly  his allies in congress  they have banked on this idea that somehow in america everybody is on their own  if you get if you don't have health insurance  hope you don't get sick  if you can't afford to start a business or go to college  he says  borrow money from your parents  you know what  that's not who we are  that's not what we're about  we believe in self reliance  we believe in individual initiative  but we also believe we're all in this together  we understand america is not just what can be done for us  but what can be done by us together  as one nation  as one people  black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  gay  straight  abled  disabled  everybody coming together  that's what we're fighting for  that's our vision of america  that's the vision we fought for in   and because of you we were able to make amazing things happen  you're the reason there's a little girl with a heart disorder who needs surgery  but now has the security of knowing she's going to get that surgery because there aren't any lifetime limits on her insurance coverage  you made that happen  you're the reason a young man who'll never who thought he'd never be able to afford his dreams to go to medical school now is going to have that chance  you made that possible  you're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home  you're the reason folks who served us so bravely are now embracing their family again and hearing those words   welcome home   i applause i  welcome home  welcome home  that happened because of you  so in   days  new hampshire  you can keep moving this country forward  in   days  you get to choose between the top down policies that got us into this mess or the policies that are getting us out of this mess  in   days  you can choose a foreign policy that takes us into wars without a plan to getting get us out or turning the page and ending wars responsibly and bringing our troops home and focusing on building america  in   days  you can choose to turn back the clock   years for immigrants or gays or women  or you can stand up and say we are going to move forward  that we're a country that will continue to be one that treats everybody with dignity and fairness  a country where no matter what you look like or what where you come from or who you love  you can make it if you try  that's what's at stake  new hampshire  that's why i'm asking for your vote  i believe in you  i need you to keep believing in me  i'm asking for your help to finish the job  and if you'll stand with me and work with me and knock on some doors for me  make some phone calls with me  if you'll vote for me  new hampshire  we'll win new hampshire again  we'll win this election  we'll finish what we started and remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  virginia  are you fired up  are you ready to go  i can't hear you  well  it's good to be back  thank you   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  can everybody please give cecile a big round of applause for the great introduction and the work she does  we've got your congressman here  gerry connolly in the house  eighteen days  eighteen days  virginia  eighteen days and you're going to step into a voting booth  and you're going to have a very big choice to make  not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  but between two fundamentally different visions for this country that we love  governor romney has got his sales pitch  we heard it the other night in the debate  he's been running around talking about his five point plan for the economy   i audience member i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote   i applause i  vote  he wants you to believe that somehow he'll create   million jobs  cut taxes by   trillion  even though it favors the wealthiest americans  none of this will add to the deficit  when folks who don't actually work for governor romney start crunching the numbers  it turns out  the tax plan doesn't add up  jobs plan doesn't create jobs  deficit plan doesn't reduce the deficit  an economist at the new york times put it this morning   there's no jobs plan  there's just a snow job on the american people  a snow job  virginia  you've heard of the new deal  you've heard of the square deal  the fair deal  mitt romney is trying to give you a sketchy deal   i laughter i  a sketchy deal  and it's really just a one point plan  not a five point plan  one point  folks at the very top play by a different set of rules than all of you   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  listen  don't boo  vote   i laughter i  if he offered you that deal when he was in corporate finance  you wouldn't give him a dime  so why would you give him his vote  this same philosophy that's been squeezing the middle class family for more than a decade  the same philosophy that got us into this mess  we can't go back to that   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i've met too many good americans who work so hard  show so much resilience  so much resolve  we have been fighting our way back from some of the same policies he's advocating  we have been there  we have tried it  we can't go back  we are moving forward  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  now  i believe that the biggest issue in this election is how do we rebuild a strong middle class and provide ladders for opportunity all those who want to get into the middle class  who are willing to work hard  willing to take responsibility  are we going to make sure that we're a country where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules  so the economy is the dominant issue  but i want everybody to understand that that's not the only place where governor romney is offering you a sketchy deal  it's bad enough that my opponent wants to take us back to the failed economic policies of the past  but when it comes to issues critical to women the right to make your own decision about your health  the right to be treated fairly and equally in the workplace governor romney wants to take us to policies more suited to the  s  even his own running mate said he's  kind of a throwback to the ' s  that's one thing we agree on   i laughter i  but i he may not have noticed  we're in the  st century  and in the  st century  a woman deserves equal pay for equal work  this should be a no brainer  but no matter how many times governor romney is asked whether or not he supports a law upholding that idea  he refuses to say  why should this be hard  are you for equal pay for equal work  are you for making sure that laws enforce that basic principle  he can't tell you  i can  i support that law  in fact  the lilly ledbetter fair pay act was the first law that i signed into office  and this isn't just a women's issue  no man should want his wife or his daughters paid less than a man for doing the same job  this is a family issue  this is an economic issue  it's one that we've got to fight for  when governor romney says he's going to get rid of funding for planned parenthood   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  what he apparently doesn't understand is that there are millions of women all across the country who rely on planned parenthood not just for contraceptive care  but for preventive care  that's not just a health issue  it's an economic issue  when governor romney said he'd have supported an extreme measure in massachusetts that could have outlawed some forms of contraception  when he joined the far right of his party to support a bill that would have allowed any employer to deny contraceptive care to their employees   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president   i vote   i laughter i  what he didn't get is that making sure your insurance policy covers contraceptive care is an economic issue also  i don't think your boss should decide what's best for your health and safety   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i don't think your insurance company gets to decide what care you should get   i audience members i  no   i the president i  and i sure don't think any politician should decide  the only person who should decide about your health care is you  and by the way  that's why we fought so hard to pass health care reform  a k a  obamacare  that's why we pushed for it  this law has secured new access to preventive care like mammograms and other cancer screenings for more than   million women with no co pay  no deductible  no out of pocket cost because i do not believe a working mother should have to put off a mammogram just because money is tight  this law means that most health plans are now beginning to cover the cost of contraceptive care  because i don't think a college student in charlottesville or blacksburg or fairfax should have to choose between textbooks or the preventive care that she needs  and by the way for all the young people out here  obamacare has already allowed nearly   million young adults under the age of   to sign up to stay on their parent's plans  for all those who are young at heart  but not young in years  it's already saved millions of seniors on medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription medicine  insurance companies can no longer put lifetime limits on your care or discriminate against children with preexisting conditions  and soon  they'll no longer be able to charge women more for the same care just because they're women  that's what change looks like   i audience member i  we love you  obama   i the president i  thank you  now  anybody who thinks that this election doesn't matter  know this  my opponent has promised to repeal all of the things we just talked about as soon as he takes office  says he'd do it on day one  we know full well that if he gets the chance  he'll rubberstamp the agenda of this republican congress the second he takes office  virginia  we can't give him that chance   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i know he's called him severely he's called himself  severely conservative  but there's nothing conservative about a government that prevents a woman from making her own health care decisions  he talks about freedom  but freedom is the ability to choose the care you need when you need it  freedom is the ability to change jobs or start your own business without the fear of losing your health insurance  freedom is the knowledge that you'll no longer be charged more than men for the same health care or denied affordable coverage just because you beat cancer  when the next president and congress could tip the balance of the highest court in the land in a way that turns back the clock for women and families for decades to come  you don't want someone who needs to ask for binders of women  you don't want that guy  you want a president who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the supreme court of the united states  so  virginia  the choice   i audience members i  obama  obama  obama   i the president i  the choice between going backward and moving forward has never been so clear  but now that we're   days out from the election  mr  severely conservative i laughter i wants you to think he was severely kidding about everything he said over the last year   i laughter i  he told folks he was  the ideal candidate  for the tea party  now suddenly  he's saying   what  who  me   i laughter i  he's forgetting what his own positions are  and he's betting that you will too  i mean  he's changing up so much and backtracking and sidestepping i laughter i we've got to name this condition that he's going through  i think it's called  romnesia   i laughter i  that's what it's called   i applause i  i think that's what he's going through  now  i'm not a medical doctor  but i do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because i want to make sure nobody else catches it   i laughter i  if you say you're for equal pay for equal work  but you keep refusing to say whether or not you'd sign a bill that protects equal pay for equal work  you might have romnesia   i laughter i  if you say women should have access to contraceptive care  but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care  you might have a case of romnesia  if you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose  but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlying outlawing that right to choose in all cases  man  you've definitely got romnesia  now  this extends to other issues  if you say earlier in the year  i'm going to give a tax cut to the top   percent and then in a debate you say  i don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks  you need to get a thermometer  take your temperature  because you've probably got romnesia  if you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when  while you were governor you stood in front of a coal plant and said  this plant will kill you i laughter i   i audience members i  romnesia   i the president   i that's some romnesia  so i think you're being able you're beginning to be able to identify these symptoms  and if you come down with a case of romnesia and you can't seem to remember the policies that are still on your web site i laughter i or the promises you've made over the   years you've been running for president  here's the good news  obamacare covers preexisting conditions   i laughter i  we can fix you up  we've got a cure  we can make you well  virginia  this is a curable disease   i laughter i  women  men all of you these are family issues  these are economic issues  i want my daughters to have the same opportunities as anybody's sons  i believe america does better the economy grows more  we create more jobs when everybody participates  when everyone is getting a fair shot  everybody is getting a fair shake  everybody is playing by the same rules  everybody is doing their fair share  that's why i'm running for a second term for president of the united states  i need you to help me finish the job   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  four years ago  i told you we'd end the war in iraq  and we did  i said we'd end the war in afghanistan  we are  i said we'd refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on   and we have  al qaida is on the path to defeat  usama bin laden is dead  four years ago  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  and i have  i promised to cut taxes for small business owners  we have   times  we got every dime back from the banks that we used for to rescue those banks  we passed laws to end taxpayer funded wall street bailouts for good  we repealed  don't ask  don't tell  to make sure that nobody who wants to serve our country gets kicked out because of who they love  when governor romney said we'd let he'd let detroit go bankrupt  we said  we're not going to take your advice  we reinvented a dying auto industry  it's come roaring back to the top of the world  four years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetime  we're moving  after losing   jobs a month when i took office  businesses have now added over   million new jobs  unemployment has fallen from   percent to   percent  home values are back on the rise  the stock market has nearly doubled   k s are starting to recover  manufacturing is coming home  assembly lines are humming again  we've got to keep moving forward  we've got to keep moving forward  we've got more work to do  i've got a plan and it's a real plan  not a sales pitch to grow the economy and create jobs and build more security for the middle class  i want to send fewer jobs overseas and sell more products overseas  i want to invest in manufacturers and small businesses that create jobs right here in virginia  right here in america  i want us to control more of our own energy  cut oil imports in half  create thousands of clean energy jobs  i want every child to have the same chance at a great education that michelle and i received  i want to hire more teachers in math and science  train   million workers at community colleges  bring down the cost of college tuition  i want to use the savings from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan to pay down our deficit  put our people back to work right here  doing some nation building here at home  that's the agenda you need  that's the agenda we need  that's how we strengthen the middle class  that's how we'll keep moving forward  and in   days  you're going to have a chance to say whether we keep moving forward  in   days  you can choose between top down economic policies that got us into this mess or the middle class out policies that are getting us out of this mess  in   days  you can choose a foreign policy that gets us into wars with no plan to get out  or you can say let's end the afghan war responsibly  let's bring our troops home  let's focus on making sure that we're building america  in   days  you can let them turn back the clock   years for immigrants and gays and women  or we can stand up and say we are a country in which everybody has a place  a country where no matter where you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  young  old  gay  straight  able  disabled we have a place for everybody  everybody has got a chance to make it if you try  that's what's at stake  virginia  that's why i'm asking you for your vote  i believe in you  i need you to keep believing in me  i want to finish the job  and if you're willing to stand with me and make some phone calls with me and knock on some doors with me  get your friends to vote for me  we will win fairfax county again  we will win virginia again  we'll finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america  hey "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  florida  are you fired up  are you ready to go  i am fired up right now  it is good to be in florida  give it up for congressman ted deutch  who's here  your mayor  nelson mcduffie  is here  state senator maria sachs  a great candidate for congress  lois frankel  and my friend and your former governor  charlie crist  is here  and i want everybody to give a huge round of applause to scott for that introduction   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  thank you  you guys really are fired up  now  i was mentioning scott  every time i need a pick me up i try to see scott   i laughter i  in addition to some outstanding pizza  and scott and charlie crist  they remind us that the values we're fighting for  they're not democratic values  they're not republican values  they are american values  and that's what this election is all about  now    weeks from today  americans in all   states will step into the voting booth  but here in florida  you get to start voting on saturday  and as scott just told you  if you need to know where to vote  you go to vote barackobama com  but i need you to vote  because you've got a very big choice to make  it's not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  it is a choice between two very different visions for this country that we love  now  last night we had our third and last debate  and i hope that during the debate i made those differences very clear  because the greatest responsibility i have as president is to keep the american people safe  that's why i ended the war in iraq  so we could go after the terrorists who actually attacked us on   that's why we decimated al qaida's core leadership and brought usama bin laden the justice he deserved  that's why we're ending the war in afghanistan  because after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building here at home  in a world of new threats and profound challenges  america needs leadership that is strong and is steady  governor romney's foreign policy has been wrong and reckless  last night he was all over the map  did you notice that  during the debate  he said he didn't want more troops in iraq  but he was caught on video saying it was unthinkable not to leave   troops in iraq  troops that would still be there today  last night he claimed to support my plan to end the war in afghanistan  i'm glad he supports it  but he's opposed a timeline that would actually bring our troops home  early in this campaign he said he'd do the opposite of whatever i did in israel  but last night i reminded him that cooperation with israel has never been stronger  last night he said he always supported taking out usama bin laden  but in   he said it wasn't worth moving heaven and earth to catch one man  now  we've come up with a name for this condition  it's called romnesia   i audience members i  romnesia  romnesia  romnesia   i the president i  we had a severe outbreak last night  it was at least stage three romnesia   i laughter i  and i just want to go over with you some of the symptoms  delray  because i want to make sure nobody in the surrounding area catches it   i laughter i  if you say that you love american cars during a debate  but you wrote an article titled  let detroit go bankrupt  you might have romnesia  if you talk about how much you love teachers during a debate  but said just a few weeks ago that we shouldn't hire any more because they won't grow the economy  what do you have   i audience members i  romnesia   i the president i  i'll bet you've got some romnesia  if you say you love medicare and by the way  there's a theme here he keeps on loving stuff and then wants to end it or cut it or not help it  but if you say that you love medicare  but your plan turns it into a voucher that ends the guaranteed benefit of medicare  you definitely have romnesia  so i mean  we're breaking down the symptoms here  if you've come down with a case of romnesia  if you can't seem to remember the policies on your web site or the promises that you've been making over the   years that you've been running for president  if you can't even remember what you said last week  don't worry  obamacare covers preexisting conditions  we can fix you up  we can cure this disease  there's a cure  i mean  listen  let me just say this  in all seriousness  i mean  we're accustomed to seeing politicians change their positions from   years ago  we are not accustomed to seeing politicians change their position from   days ago   i laughter i  i mean and we joke about romnesia  but you know what this is actually something important  this is about trust  there's no more serious issue in a presidential campaign than trust  the person who leads this country  you've got to have some confidence that he or she means what he or she says  that if they tell you they're going to do something or that this is what they believe  that they're going to actually try to do it  it doesn't mean that every candidate is going to get everything done all at once perfectly  but you want somebody to be able to look you in the eye and say  here's what i believe  here's what i stand for  here's what i'll fight for  here's what i care about  here's who i'm going to be looking out for in the debates in washington  but part of the reason i think this is hard for governor romney to do is his job plan doesn't really create jobs  his deficit plan doesn't reduce the deficit  it adds to it  his foreign policy is from the  s  his social policy is from the  s  his economic policies are from the  s  so everything he's doing right now is to hide his real positions and try to win this election  he wants to just spend all his time and focus on telling people what he thinks is wrong with america  i mean  if you notice  in his debates  in his speeches  he is really excellent at listing all the things that are wrong  he can just go over it verbatim  just boom  boom  boom powerpoint presentation  but you know what  that's not leadership that you can trust  and  florida  you know me  you can trust that i say what i mean  and i mean what i say  and yes  we've been through tough times  but you've never seen me quit   i audience members i  no   i the president i  and there's no quit in america   i audience members i  no   i the president i  so for over the last   years  we've been making real progress  fighting our way back from these policies that failed america  our businesses have now added more than   million new jobs over the past   years  unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since i took office  home values are rising  the stock market has nearly doubled  our assembly lines are getting back to work  and our heroes are coming home  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  and i did  by   i promised to cut taxes for small business owners like scott  and we have   times  i promised we would fix the financial situation that was broken when i came into office  but we got back every single dime  with interest  that we used to rescue the banks  we passed a law to end taxpayer funded wall street bailouts for good  we repealed  don't ask  don't tell  so that nobody is ever kicked out of the military because of who they love  when the heartbeat of american manufacturing was flatlining  we said thanks  governor  i know you've got all this private sector experience  but your advice isn't going to work this time  and today  the american auto industry's engines are roaring at full throttle again  i said that i would make sure that nobody in america goes bankrupt when they get sick  and we delivered on that promise  i said i'd make college more affordable for our young people  and we delivered on that promise  i do what i say  you've seen me  we're not yet where we need to be  but we've made real progress  and now we need to build on that progress  and  florida  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america  that's why i'm running   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  in this campaign  i've laid out a plan for jobs and middle class security  and unlike mitt romney  i'm actually proud to talk about what's in it i laughter i because my plan actually will move america forward  and by the way  the math in my plan adds up   i laughter i  if we've got any math teachers out there  you can go ahead and look in this plan  and you'll see that the numbers work  i won't be running the okeydoke on you   i laughter i  if you want to take a look at it  you check it out at barackobama com plans  share it with your friends  share is with your neighbors  share it with your coworkers  folks who are still not convinced  they can look right here and find out what it is i intend to do in a second term  there are still people out there who are trying to make up their minds  some of you here may still be trying to make up your minds  maybe you just thought   i audience members i  no   i the president i  no  some people here might have thought it was a concert going on or something and wandered in by mistake   i laughter i  thought scott was giving away free pizza  so for those of you who are still making up your minds or your friends or your family i ask folks  compare my plan to governor romney's  see which plan is better for you and for america's future  now  let me just summarize it real quick  first  my plan builds on our manufacturing growth by ending tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to reward small businesses and manufacturers who are creating jobs right here in the united states of america  second  my plan will cut our oil imports in half by   so we control more of our own energy here in america  and by the way  today we are less dependent on foreign oil than any time in   years  and one reason is because we increased fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks so that they will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  and we need to build on that progress  not just by producing more oil and gas  but by investing in clean energy technology that's creating jobs here in florida and all across america  number three   i audience members i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  but i got this plan i want to talk about  so i do  number three  my plan will make it a national mission to educate our kids and train our workers so that they can compete better than anybody in the world  i want to recruit   new math and science teachers over the next decade  i want to train   million workers at our community colleges with the skills that businesses are looking for right now  i want to work with colleges and universities to keep down the growth in tuition costs because i want every young person to be able to get the higher education that they're willing to work for  number four  my plan is going to cut the deficit by   trillion  remember  i said the numbers actually add up  we're going to do it in a balanced way by cutting spending we don't need  but by also asking the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more so we can invest in research  invest in technology  those things that keep new jobs and businesses coming to america  and i will not  in our pursuit of reducing the deficit  turn medicare into a voucher because no american should spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  that's not what medicare is about  and finally  my plan will use the savings from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan to put our people back to work doing some nation building here at home  repairing roads  fixing bridges  building schools all across america  and when our veterans come home  we will serve them as well as they've served us and make sure that they are out there getting the jobs that are going to help build america  by the way  i just want to point out  in the same way that governor romney didn't mention the afghan war or our troops in his convention speech  governor romney didn't even mention our veterans last night   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  he didn't say a word about it  now  he may write off half the country as victims behind closed doors  but the men and women and their families who have served this country so bravely  they deserve better from somebody who's applying to be commander in chief  it is my greatest honor serving as their commander in chief  and i will fight for our troops and our veterans every single day  so that's the plan we need  florida  that's how you build a strong  sustainable economy that has good middle class jobs to offer  that's how you make sure that you've got increased take home pay  that's how you make sure that businesses are taking root all across florida and all across america  and now it's up to you to choose the path we take from here  starting on saturday  florida  you can choose the top down policies that got us into this mess  or you can choose the policies we're using to get us out of this mess  you can choose a foreign policy that's reckless and wrong  or you can choose one that is steady and strong  you can choose to turn back the clock   years for immigrants and gays and women  or in this election  you can decide we will remain an inclusive  generous country where no matter who you are  or what you look like  or where you come from  or who you love  you can make it if you try  you've got a place in the american family  that's what's at stake right now  we can go back  or we can choose to move forward  to focus on the challenges and opportunities of the  st century  to work together as one nation  as one people  to make it another american century  that's the kind of president i've been  florida  that's the kind of president i intend to be  i'm asking for your vote  i'm asking for your help  i believe in you  and i'm asking you to believe in me  and if you stand with me and work with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls with me  if you do that  we will win palm beach county again  we'll win florida again  we'll finish what we started  we will win this election  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  ohio  are you fired up  are you ready to go  i just want to make sure  are you fired up   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  are you ready to go   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  before we get started  i want everybody to give a big round of applause to joe biden  now  first of all  you need to know joe biden is a man who is literally in love with a teacher  he doesn't just say  i love teachers  he's married to a teacher  but more importantly i want everybody to understand this i could not ask for a better partner than my vice president joe biden  there's nobody who knows more about foreign policy than my vice president  there's nobody who gives me better advice than my vice president  there's nobody who you'd rather have in a foxhole with you when it matters most than my vice president  there's nobody who cares more about the middle class and fights harder for america than my vice president  i could not do what i do without him having my back every single day  so i want you to give him another big round of applause   i audience members i  joe  joe  joe   i the president i  joe  joe  joe   i audience members i  joe  joe  joe   i the president i  we've also got a great candidate for congress  sharen neuhardt is here  give her a big round of applause  now    weeks  ohio  two weeks  two weeks from today  americans all across the country will step into the voting booth  but here in ohio  you can vote early  here in ohio  you can vote right after this event  if you want to know where to vote  you go to vote barackobama com   i audience member i  is biden going to be there   i the president i  he already voted  and he's proud of it  anybody who is here who has not yet voted  i want you to go vote  because you've got a very big choice to make  not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  but two different visions for this country that we love  now  last night we had our third debate  and i hope i made clear that there's a big difference between me and mitt romney  and it's not just that he's got better hair   i laughter i  because the greatest responsibility i have as president is to keep the american people safe  that's why i ended the war in iraq  so we could go after the terrorists who actually attacked us on   that's why  working with joe biden and our national security team  we've been able to decimate al qaida  that's why we were able to bring usama bin laden to justice  that's why we're now ending the war in iraq  because after a decade of war  it's time to do some nation building right here in ohio  do some nation building here in the united states of america  in a world of new threats and challenges  america needs leadership that is strong and steady  unfortunately  governor romney's foreign policy has been wrong and reckless  you heard him last night  he was all over the map  during the debate  he said he didn't want more troops in iraq  but he was caught on a video just a few months ago saying it was  unthinkable  not to leave   troops in iraq  those troops would still be there today instead of back home  last night he claimed to support my plan to end the war in afghanistan  but he opposed a timeline that would actually bring the rest of our troops home  last night he said taking out bin laden was the right thing to do  back in   he said it wasn't worth  moving heaven and earth  to catch one man  now  i recognize that we must have some doctors in the house  because i've already heard people identify this condition  it's called romnesia   i laughter i  and we had a severe case breaking out last night   i laughter i  so i want to go over the symptoms with you because  dayton  i sure don't want anybody to catch it here in ohio  if you talk about how much you love teachers during a debate  but just a few weeks ago you said we shouldn't hire any more because it won't grow our economy  you might have romnesia  if you say you won't give a big tax cut to the wealthy  but you're on a video promising your tax cut would include the top   percent  that sounds like a classic case of romnesia  if you say that you love american cars during a debate  you're a car guy  but you wrote an article titled  let detroit go bankrupt  you definitely have a case of romnesia  last night governor romney looked you right in the eye looked me in the eye and tried to pretend that he never said  let detroit go bankrupt  tried to pretend he meant the same thing i did when we intervened and worked to make sure that management and workers got together to save the u s  auto industry  pretended like somehow i had taken his advice  the people don't forget  the people of dayton don't forget   i audience members i  no   i the president i  the people of ohio don't forget   i audience members i  no   i the president i  if mitt romney had been president when the auto industry was on the verge of collapse  we might not have an american auto industry today  we'd be buying cars from china instead of selling cars to china   i audience members i  no   i the president i  and you know how important that is to ohio  the auto industry supports one in eight ohio jobs  it's a source of pride to this state  it is a source of pride to our country  it's a source of pride to generations of workers  i refused to walk away from those workers  i bet on those workers  i refused to walk away from those jobs  i understood that americans can compete  i wasn't about to let detroit go bankrupt or toledo go bankrupt or lordstown go bankrupt  i bet on american workers  i bet on american manufacturing  i would do it again because that bet has paid off for ohio and for america in a big way  so here's the good news  ohio  if you've come down with a case of romnesia i laughter i if you can't seem to remember the positions that you've taken not just   years ago  but   days ago  if you don't remember the positions that are on your web site  if you don't remember the promises you've been making during the   years you've been running for president  you don't have to worry  because obamacare covers preexisting conditions  we can fix you up  there's a cure  there's a cure  there's a cure  but you've got to vote to make sure that the medicine is there for romnesia  now  we joke about governor romney being all over the map  but it speaks to something important  it speaks of trust  there's no more serious issue in a presidential campaign than trust  trust matters  you want to know that the person who's applying to be your president and commander in chief is trustworthy  that he means what he says  that he's not just making stuff up depending on whether it's convenient or not  so smart people who they don't have a dog in this fight they've crunched the numbers  and we know that governor romney's jobs plan doesn't really create jobs  we know his deficit plan doesn't really reduce the deficit  his foreign policy is from the  s  before the cold war was over  his social policy is from the  s  and his economic policies are from the  s  he knows he can't sell that even though those are his positions  so in the closing weeks of the campaign  he's doing everything he can to hide his true positions and tell us what he thinks you want to hear and then spend most of his time telling you what he thinks is wrong with america  joe biden just talked about that  talking about america is in decline  he is terrific at making presentations about stuff he thinks is wrong with america  but he sure can't give you an answer about what will make it right  and that's not leadership that you can trust  you know  ohio  you know me  you know i mean what i say  you know that i do what i say i'm going to do  you know that i'll make the tough decisions even when they're not popular  folks don't remember  what we did with the auto industry  it wasn't popular when we did it  it wasn't even popular in michigan and ohio  but it was necessary  and because i had folks like joe biden with me who can support me when i make tough decisions  we went in and did what we thought was right  and i know people may not agree with every decision we make  but you know that i'm doing it because i am fighting for the american people  i'm doing what i believe  that's what you need from a president  yes  we've been through tough times  but there's no quit in america  our businesses have added more than   million new jobs over the past   years  manufacturing is growing faster than any time since the  s  our unemployment rate has fallen to the lowest level since i took office  home values are rising  the stock market has rebounded  our assembly lines are humming again  our heroes are coming home  we are moving forward  four years ago  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  and i kept that promise  i promised to cut taxes for small businesses  we have   times  we got back every dime we used to rescue the banks  with interest  and then we passed a law to end taxpayer funded wall street bailouts for good  we repealed  don't ask  don't tell  because anybody who wants to serve in our military  if they're a great soldier or marine or airman or coastguardsman  then they should be able to serve regardless of who they love  we saved an american auto industry  it's engines are roaring at full throttle with nearly   new jobs  that's not just something that the midwest can be proud of  that's something america can be proud of  now  we know we're not where we need to be not here  not anywhere but we've made real progress  we've got to build on that progress  we can't go back to what got us into this mess  we need to move forward with what's getting us out of this mess  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  last night and throughout this campaign i've laid out a plan for jobs and middle class security  unlike  mitt romney  i'm proud to talk about what's in my plan  because  first of all  the math actually adds up  my plan will actually move america forward  it's not just a sales job  it's not a sketchy deal  it's not the okeydoke   i laughter i  if you want to take a look  check it out at barackobama com plans  share it with your friends  share it with your neighbors  share it with your coworkers  there are still some people out there trying to make up their minds  some of you here may still be trying to make up your mind   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i'm just saying somebody might have just been taking a nice walk on a beautiful day i laughter i and suddenly found themselves in the middle of an obama rally  and if that's what happened to you  i want you to look at our plan  compare it to governor romney's plan  see which plan you think is better for you and for america's future  well  he says he's got a plan  he's got a one point plan  but i want to talk about what's in my plan just so everybody knows exactly what i intend to do over the next   years  because i do what i say i'm going to do  first  my plan builds on our manufacturing base by extending by making sure that we're ending tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to give those tax breaks to small business and manufacturers that create jobs right here in dayton  right here in the united states of america  that's what i want to do  number two  my plan cuts our oil imports in half by   so we control more of our own energy  you may have heard me say this  today we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last two decades  and one of the reasons is because we've increased fuel standards on cars and trucks  so you go twice as far on a gallon of gas  and i want to build on that progress  i don't want fuel efficient cars and long lasting batteries and wind turbines all made in china  i want them manufactured right here in the united states of america  and we can do that  number three  my plan is going to make it a national mission to educate our kids and train our workers so that we can compete with anybody in the world  i want to recruit   new math and science teachers over the next decade  train   million workers at community colleges with the skills that businesses are looking for right now  there are jobs to be had right now  but the workers have to be able to get the training for them  i want to make sure colleges and universities keep tuition low so our young people can get a college education without being loaded up with debt  we can do that  number four  my plan will cut our deficit by   trillion  it actually adds up  we can do the math on the web site  in the plan  we'll do it in a balanced way over the next   years  i'll cut spending we don't need  but we're also going to have to ask the wealthiest among us to do a little bit more  because that will allow us to invest in research and technology to keep new jobs coming  to keep new businesses coming here to america  and i'll never balance the deficit by turning medicare into a voucher  no american should have to spend their golden years at the mercy of an insurance company  and finally  my plan says let's take the savings from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan  and let's put some people back to work right here at home  doing some nation building  repairing roads  fixing bridges  remodeling schools  laying down broadband lines  making our economy more competitive  and when our veterans come home  let's put them back to work in some of these jobs  let's make sure we're serving them as well as they've served us  governor romney did not even mention our veterans last night   i audience members i  no   i the president i  not a word  not a word  he may have already written off half the country behind closed doors  but the men and women and their families who have served our country so bravely  that joe and i talk to almost every day and we see the sacrifices they're making  they deserve better from somebody who's applying to be commander in chief  we're fighting for them every single day  so  ohio  that's the plan we need  that's what will create jobs  that's how you build a strong  sustainable economy that good  middle class jobs have to offer  that's how you encourage businesses to start here in america  that's how you increase take home pay  not just by talking about it  that's how you build an economy where everybody who works hard has a chance to get ahead  we don't build the economy from the top down  we build it from the middle up  and now it's up to you  right here  right now  you've got to decide which path we're going to take  you can choose the top down policies that got us into this mess  or you can choose the policies that we are promoting that will get us out of this mess  you can choose a foreign policy that's reckless and wrong  or you can choose the foreign policy that joe and i have been applying that's steady and strong  you can choose to turn back the clock   years for women and immigrants and gays  or you can say  in this election  we believe that everybody has got a place in america  we want to make sure everybody has got opportunity  no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter what your last name is  no matter who you love  here in america  you can make it if you try  so i'm asking for your vote  i'm asking you to help me finish the job  i believe in you  and i need you to keep believing in me  and if you stand with me and knock on some doors with me  make some phone calls for me  we'll win montgomery county again  we'll win ohio again  we'll win this election again  we'll finish what we started  we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  ohio  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  iowa  hello  quads  it's good to be back  this is about as close as i get to home these days  so it is good to be back  are you fired up  are you ready to go  at the outset  let's give cassandra a huge round of applause for her service to our country and the great introduction  we've got your congressman here  dave loebsack  your mayor  bill gluba  and we've got all of you  and i'm really excited to see you  now  this is the first stop on our  hour fly around campaign marathon extravaganza  we're going to pull an all nighter  no sleep  we're starting here in iowa  we're going to colorado  then we're going to go to nevada  then we're going to florida  virginia  ohio  i am going to stop in chicago to vote  we've got early vote in illinois  just like we've got early vote here in iowa  but i had to start in iowa to ask you for your vote  to ask you for your support  so we can finish what we started  because this is where it all began   years ago  on your front porches  in your backyards  this is where the movement for change began  and  iowa  you will once again choose the path that we take from here  i know at this point because you guys have seen a lot of tv commercials you've heard governor romney's sales pitch   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  no  don't boo  vote  he's been running around saying he's got a five point plan for the economy  let me tell you  it turns out it's only a one point plan   i laughter i  folks at the very top get to play by a very different set of rules than you do  they can keep paying lower tax rates than you do  keep their money in offshore accounts  they can buy up a company  load it up with debt  lay off the workers  strip away their pensions  send the jobs overseas  and they still make a big profit  while the middle class gets stuck with the bill   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  that was his philosophy in the private sector  that was his philosophy as governor  that's his philosophy now  it's not a very inspiring vision for our country  so   weeks from the election  because he knows that if he actually told everybody what he wants to do  he probably wouldn't get any votes  so he's doing everything he can to make sure that you don't notice what he's been saying  and we've come up with a name for this condition  it's called romnesia   i laughter i  romnesia  i want to go over the symptoms with you  then  for it  because i don't want you to catch it  i don't want it to spread  if you say you won't give a big tax cut to the wealthy  but you're caught on video promising your tax cut would include the top   percent  then you might have romnesia   i laughter i  if you talk about how much you love teachers during a debate  but just a few weeks ago  you said we shouldn't hire any more teachers  because they won't grow the economy  you probably have romnesia   i laughter i  if you sit on stage in a nationally televised debate saying how much you love cars you're a car guy except you wrote an article titled  let detroit go bankrupt  then you almost certainly have romnesia  if you can't seem to remember the policies on your own web site or the promises you made over the last   years that you've been running for president or the promises you made   days ago  you probably have romnesia  but don't worry  obamacare covers preexisting conditions  we can pick you up  there's a cure  we can make you well  as long as you vote  iowa  we can cure folks of this malady  of this disease  listen  smart people who don't have a dog in this fight independent analysts  economists they took out their pencils  they had their green eyeshades  they crunched the numbers  turns out governor romney's economic plan is a sketchy deal  the results are not what you'd want to write home about  the washington post calls his jobs plan a  bait and switch  the bait is the promise that his plan creates   million jobs  the switch is the fact that his plan doesn't create   million jobs   i laughter i  that's the bait and the switch  in fact  it won't even create jobs right now  and then governor romney wants to spend   trillion on tax cuts that favor the wealthy    trillion on defense spending that our military isn't asking for  and he wants you to believe that he can do that without adding to the deficit or raising middle class taxes  the problem is you'd need to invent a new kind of math to actually make this true   i audience member i  arithmetic   i the president i  the arithmetic does not work  so we know governor romney's jobs plan doesn't create jobs  his deficit plan doesn't reduce the deficit  and we joke about romnesia  but all of this speaks to something that's really important  and that is the issue of trust  there's no more serious issue on a presidential campaign than trust  trust matters  and here's the thing  iowa  you know me  you know that i say what i mean  and i mean what i say  there are some folks in this crowd who have probably been following me since i was running for the united states senate  and you know what  you can like this guy right here  who i served with in the united states senate  george shadid  and you could take a videotape of things i said   years ago    years ago  and you'd say  man  this is the same guy  has the same values  cares about the same people  doesn't forget where he came from  knows who he's fighting for  and you know what  i haven't finished all the work that we set out to do back in   but i have fought for you every single day that i've held this office  and with your help  i've kept the commitments that i've made  i told you we'd end the war in iraq  we did  i said we'd begin the process of ending the war in afghanistan  we are  i said we'd refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on   and we have  and a new tower rises over the new york skyline  al qaida is on the path to defeat  and usama bin laden is dead  i kept that promise  i kept that promise  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses  and we've done that  i promised to end taxpayer funded wall street bailouts for good  and we have  i promised to repeal  don't ask  don't tell  and today  you can't be kicked out of the military because of who you are or who you love  i said i'd bet on american workers and american ingenuity  and while the other guy was saying let detroit go bankrupt  i went in there and worked with the workers and the management  and we've saved a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world  on issue after issue  we are moving forward  after losing   million jobs in the great recession  our businesses have now added more than   million new jobs over the past   years  manufacturing is at its highest level since the  s  unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since i took office  home values and home sales are rising  our assembly lines are humming again  we've got a long way to go  iowa  but we've come too far to turn back now  we can't afford to go back to what got us into this mess  we've got to stick with policies that are getting out of this mess  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  the good news is  i've got a plan that will actually create jobs  that will actually reduce the deficit  that will actually create middle class security  and unlike mitt romney  i'm proud to talk about what's actually in my plan  because my math actually adds up  if you want to take a look at it  check it out at barackobama com plans  i want you to share it with your friends  share it with your neighbors  share it with your coworkers  there are still people out there who may be trying to make up their minds  maybe somebody here thought they were visiting the haunted house over there and just kind of wandered over  trying to figure out what's going on i laughter i and they haven't made up their mind yet  i want them to know  i want everybody out there to compare my plans to governor romney's  have the information you need  see which plan is better for you and for america's future  first of all  i want to end tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to reward small businesses and manufacturers who are creating jobs right here in the united states of america  that's what i want to do  second  i want to cut our oil imports in half by   so we control more of our own energy  some of you may know we are  today  less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades because of the steps we've taken  because we increased fuel standards on cars and trucks so they're going to go twice as far on a gallon of gas  because we've been producing clean energy  including right here in iowa  today  there are factories in iowa where once laid off workers are back on the job building wind towers  building wind blades  i want to build on that progress  i don't want fuel efficient cars and long lasting batteries and wind turbines manufactured in china  i want them manufactured here in iowa  i want them made in the united states of america  and we can do that  number three  we are going to make it a national mission to educate our kids and train our workers better than anybody else in the world  i want to recruit   new math and science teachers  train   million workers at community colleges with the skills that businesses are looking for right now  i want to work with colleges and universities to cut the growth of tuition so our young people can afford a higher education without getting loaded up with debt  we can do that  number four  my plan will cut the deficit by   trillion over the next   years  but we're going to do it in a balanced way  we're going to cut out spending we don't need  but we're also going to ask the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more  and we're going to do that so we can invest in research and technology that keeps new jobs and businesses coming to america  and i'll never turn medicare into a voucher  no american should spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  and finally  i'm going to use the savings from ending the war in iraq and ending the war in afghanistan to put our people back to work right here at home  do some nation building here  repairing roads  bridges  schools all across america  and when our veterans like cassandra come home  we're going to serve them as well as they've served us  we're going to make sure that they've got the support that they need  because nobody who has fought for america should have to fight for a job when they come home  so  iowa  that's the plan that we need  that's how you build a strong  sustainable economy that creates good middle class jobs  that makes sure that folks have the sense that not only are they doing well now  but their future prospects are going to be bright  that's how you're going to encourage new businesses to start here and stay here  that's how you actually increase take home pay  not by talking about it and then wanting to cut taxes for folks at the very top  this is how you build an economy where everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead  that's what america is about  that's the basic bargain that we believe in  and now it's up to you  iowa  right here  right now  today  you've got a chance to choose the path that we're going to take from here  it's up to the young people who are here today to choose the future that you want to see  you can choose the top down policies that got us into this mess  or you can choose the policies that are helping us to get out of this mess  you can choose a foreign policy that is reckless and wrong  or you can choose the kind of leadership that i've shown that's steady and strong and clear  sends clear messages to our allies and to our enemies  you can choose to turn back the clock   years on women and immigrants and gays   i audience members i  no   i the president i  or in this election  you can stand up for the kind of america that says  we embrace everybody  we believe in giving everybody a fair shot and everybody doing their fair share  everybody playing by the same rules  it doesn't matter whether you're black or white or hispanic or asian or native american  whether you're young or old  able  disabled  gay straight  it doesn't matter  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter who you are  you can make it here if you try  that's the america we believe in  so listen  iowa  we've been through tough times over these last   years  but we've been through tougher times before  the good news is we always bounce back  we always come out on top  because the american people are tougher than any tough times  because we pull together  because we look after one another  because we leave nobody behind  because we don't turn back  because we're always looking at the horizon in front of us  because we're always moving forward  and that's why i'm asking for your vote today  that's why i'm asking for your vote in this election  and if you give me that vote  i promise you i will always listen to your voices  i will always fight for your families  i'll spend every waking day continuing to make sure that your lives are a little bit better  this is where it got started

win scott county again  we'll win iowa again  we'll win this election again  and we'll finish what we started and remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  colorado  thank you  are you fired up  are you ready to go  are you fired up   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  are you ready to go   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  well  i'm fired up  thank you so much  everybody  can everybody please give sidra a great round of applause for that wonderful introduction  we've got some good friends here today  you've got your outstanding governor  john hickenlooper  one of the best senators in the country  michael bennet  outstanding congresswoman  diana degette  your wonderful mayor  michael hancock  my campaign cochair and former mayor  federico pena  and all of you are here  which makes me excited  this is the second stop on our  hour  marathon extravaganza fly around  we are pulling an all nighter  no sleep  quite a bit of coffee   i laughter i  we've just come from iowa  after this we've got some iowans here   i laughter i  we are on our way to visit nevada  we're going to go to florida  we're going to go to virginia  we're going to go to ohio  and i am going to stop in chicago to vote before this  hour day is done  i can't tell you who i'm voting for   i laughter i  it's a secret ballot  but michelle says she voted for me  that's what she said  so we can vote early in illinois just like you can vote early in colorado  and i've come back to colorado and this may not be the last time you'll see me  i've come to ask you for your vote  i've come to ask you to help me keep moving america forward  we now have gone through three debates  months of campaigning  way too many tv ads   i audience member i  amen   i the president i  oh  yes  got an amen over here   i laughter i  you've heard  now  governor romney's sales pitch  he has been running around saying he's got a five point plan for the economy   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  vote  that's the way to show your opinion  is to vote  it turns out it's not a five point plan governor romney has got  it's a one point plan  folks at the very top get to play by their own rules  pay lower tax rates than you do  outsource more jobs  let wall street run wild  and if this plan sounds familiar  it's because we tried it  we tried it in the decade before i took office  and it led to falling incomes and record deficits and the slowest job growth in half a century and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  and we've been working for   years to clean up this mess that these policies left behind  now  governor romney knows this  he knows his plan isn't any different than the policies that led to the great recession  so in the final weeks of his election  he's counting on you forgetting what he stands for  he's hoping that you  too  will come down with a case of what we like to call romnesia   i laughter i  he's hoping you won't remember that his economic plan is more likely to create jobs in china than here in the united states  because it rewards companies that move jobs and profits overseas  he's hoping you won't remember that he wants to give millionaires and billionaires a   tax cut  because the only way he can pay for it is by raising the deficit or by raising your taxes  he's hoping you'll come down with a severe case of romnesia just before you cast your ballot  but  denver  i want you to know this  if you feel any symptoms coming on i laughter i you start feeling  oh  i've got a temperature  i got headaches  my eyes are getting blurry  it might be romnesia  but don't worry  obamacare covers preexisting conditions  we can make you well  there's a cure  colorado  as long as you vote  there's a cure  now  we joke about romnesia  but all this speaks to something that is essential to your choice  and that is trust  when you choose a president  you don't know what is going to come up  i mean  when i was running in   we didn't know necessarily that we would see the financial system completely implode  we didn't know that the auto industry might go under  we didn't understand what might be happening in terms of an arab spring  but what you were voting on is somebody who you felt you could trust to work for you  to keep you in mind every single day  trust matters  and one thing i think you've seen  colorado  over the last   years is that i mean what i say  i do what i say i'm going to do  we haven't finished everything that we want to get done  that's why i'm running for a second term  but every single day that i set foot in the oval office  i'm fighting for your families  and with your help  i've kept many of the major commitments that we made  i told you we'd end the war in iraq  we ended it  i said we'd end the war in afghanistan  we are  i said we'd refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on   and now we've got a new tower rising above the new york skyline  and al qaida is on the path to defeat  usama bin laden is dead  our heroes are coming home  i've kept those promises  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses  and we have  i promised to end taxpayer funded wall street bailouts for good  and we did  i promised to repeal  don't ask  don't tell  and today you can't be kicked out of the military because of who you are and who you love  i bet on american workers and american ingenuity  and we saved a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world  on issue after issue  we are moving forward  after losing   million jobs in the great recession  our businesses have now added more than   million new jobs over the past   years  manufacturing is coming back to our shores  the unemployment rate has fallen  home values and home sales are rising  our assembly lines are humming  we've got a long way to go  colorado  but we've come too far to turn back now  we cannot go back to the same policies that got us into this mess  we've got to keep moving forward with the policies that are getting us out  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  now  you know  we   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  the reason i want   more years is because i've got a plan that will actually create jobs  a plan that will actually create middle class security  and unlike mitt romney  i'm actually proud to talk about what's in my plan  because it actually adds up  and if you want to check it out  go to barackobama com plans  share it with your friends  share it with neighbors  share it with coworkers  there are still people out there who are trying to make up their mind  some of you may be trying to make up your mind  maybe some   i audience members i  no   i the president i  no  no  maybe no somebody may have dragged you here   i laughter i  maybe your grandma said  i'm sorry  you've got to come   i laughter i  maybe your girlfriend is trying to knock some sense into you  said  no  no  you've got to come to the rally  so i want you to compare my plan to governor romney's  see which plan you think is better for you  see which plan is better for america's future  i look  i want to end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas  but i also want to reward small businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the united states  i want to cut our oil imports in half by   and we're going to develop traditional sources of energy  and today  we are less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last two decades  but it's not enough just to produce more oil and natural gas  we've also increased fuel standards on cars and trucks so your car will go farther on a gallon of gas  i want to build on the progress we've made doubling clean energy  i want fuel efficient cars and long lasting batteries and wind turbines manufactured here in china i want them i don't want them manufactured in china  i want them manufactured here in the united states  i want them manufactured right here in colorado  right here in america  and by the way  it will be good for our environment  it will help conserve the incredible natural beauty of this state  we can do that  i want to make it a national mission to educate our kids and train our workers better than anyone else in the world  i want to recruit   math and science teachers  train   million workers at community colleges to get the skills that businesses are hiring for right now  i want to work with our colleges and universities to keep tuition growth low  cut it in half over the next   years  we can do that  my plan will actually cut the deficit  unlike governor romney's  it will actually cut the deficit by   trillion over the next   years  but we're going to do it in a balanced way  we'll cut out programs that don't work  but we also need to make sure that the wealthy are paying a little bit more so we can afford to invest in technology and research that will keep new jobs and businesses coming to america  and i'll never turn medicare into a voucher  no american should spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  and i'll use the savings that we get from ending the war in iraq and afghanistan to put our people back to work doing some nation building here at home  repairing our roads and our bridges and our schools  extending broadband lines into rural communities  making sure that when our veterans come home  that we are hiring them and they are getting the same kinds of opportunities that they deserve  because they shouldn't have to fight for a job when they come home after fighting for america  that's my plan  that's the plan we need for colorado  that's how you build a strong  sustainable economy that has good  middle class jobs to offer  that's how you encourage new businesses to start right here  that's how you help small businesses  that's how you increase take home pay  that's how you build an economy where everybody who works hard has a chance to get ahead  that's what we can do together  but right now it's up to you  colorado  right here  right now  today  you will choose the path we take  it's up to young people to make sure that they continue to have opportunities in the future to go to college  to get a good job  it's up to the not so young people to choose what including me to choose what we leave behind for future generations  so we've got you can choose the top down policies that got us into this mess  or we can choose the policies that are going to keep on getting us out of this mess  you can choose a foreign policy that's wrong and reckless  or you can choose the steady  strong leadership that we need in the world  you can choose to turn back the clock   years for women and immigrants and gays  or in this election  you can stand up for that basic principle that we are all created equal  that no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter who you love  here in america  you can make it if you try  colorado  we have been through some tough years  but the american people are always tougher  we always bounce back  because we pull together  because we look after one another  we don't turn back  we go forward  we don't leave anybody behind  we pull them up with us  in america  our destiny is not written for us  it's written by us  and we are going to write the next chapter together  and that's why i am asking you for your vote  and if you give me that vote  colorado  you'll have a president who hears your voice  a president who fights for your families  a president who spends every waking hour trying to make your lives a little bit better  i believe in you  colorado  and i'm asking you to keep believing in me  and if you're willing to roll up your sleeves with me  if you're willing to work with me and knock some doors with me  make some phone calls with me  we're going to win colorado again  we're going to win this election  we're going to finish what we started  we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the

outstanding united states senator  mark warner  and the man who's going to join him in the united states senate  tim kaine  these guys are great friends of mine  they were great governors of this great commonwealth  and they will be an extraordinary team fighting for you in washington  you also have a great congressman coming out of virginia  bobby scott  in the house  your mayor  dwight jones  is here  and all of you are here  can i just say  this is a nice looking crowd here  now  you might notice that my voice sounds just a little hoarse   i laughter i  we are right in the middle of our  hour  fly around  campaign extravaganza  we pulled an all nighter last night  we just came from florida  we were in iowa and colorado and nevada before that  we're heading up to ohio later today  and i'm going to stop in my hometown of chicago to vote  i can't tell you who i'm voting for because it's a secret ballot   i laughter i  but the good news is  michelle said she voted for me  she did  and i've come to virginia today to ask you for your vote just   days from now  i need your vote  i've come to ask for your help in keeping america moving forward  you've now seen three debates  months of campaign events  and way too many tv commercials   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  so you've heard what the argument is about here  you understand what the choice is  you've heard governor romney's sales pitch  he's been running around   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  no  don't boo  vote  he's been running around saying he's got a five point plan for the economy  turns out it's a one point plan  folks at the very top get to play by a different set of rules than you do  they get to pay a lower tax rate  they get to outsource jobs  they want to roll back wall street reforms that we put in place to make sure we don't have taxpayer funded bailouts  that was his philosophy in the boardroom  that was his philosophy as governor  and if it sounds familiar  it's because that's exactly what we tried in the last decade before i came into office  it led to falling incomes and record deficits and the slowest job growth in half a century  and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  we have now been working for   years to clean up the mess those policies left behind  and now governor romney wants to take us back to those policies  but he knows that they're probably not very popular  he knows his plan isn't any different than the policies that got us into trouble  so in the final weeks of this election  he's counting on you forgetting  he's hoping that you come down with a case of what we call romnesia  he's hoping you won't remember that his economic plan is more likely to create jobs in china than it is in america  because it actually rewards companies that ship jobs and profits overseas  he's hoping you won't remember that he wants to give millionaires and billionaires a   tax cut  because the only way he can

before you cast your ballot  but  richmond  i want you all to know this  this is a curable disease  if you feel any symptoms coming on  if you're starting to get a little woozy i laughter i your eyes are getting a little blurry  some ringing in your ears  if you can't remember what you said just a week ago  if you can't remember the plans on your own website and you're worried you might be coming down with a case of romnesia  i want you to know  obamacare covers preexisting conditions  we can make you well  we can fix you up  all you've got to do is vote   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  hold on   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  richmond  i want to explain something  we joke about this  but this goes to a pretty serious issue  the most serious issue of any presidential contest  and that is the issue of trust  trust matters  you want to know that whoever is in the oval office is going to fight for you  you want to know that they're not just going to take the politically expedient path  that they're guided by a compass in terms of how are we going to make sure the american people have a chance to succeed if they're working hard  and more importantly  that the next generation is going to have the kind of america we want them to have  and you know what  you know me   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  you know i say what i mean and i mean what i say  we haven't finished all the work we set out to do in   just yet  but every single day i set foot in the oval office  you know i'm thinking about you  i'm fighting for your families  and with your help  we have met major commitments that i made   years ago  i told you we'd end the war in iraq  we did  i said we'd end the war in afghanistan  we are  i said we'd refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on   al qaida is on the path to defeat  and usama bin laden is dead  there's a new tower rising above the new york skyline  our heroes are coming home  i've kept those promises  i was proud and humbled to learn that we have colin powell's support in this campaign  i'm grateful to him for his lifetime of service to his country  both as a soldier and as a diplomat  and every brave american who wears this uniform of this country should know that as long as i'm your commander in chief  we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  we will be relentless in pursuit of our enemies  those are promises i've kept  four years ago  i promised to cut middle class taxes for families and small businesses  and we have  i promised not only to end taxpayer funded wall street bailouts  but i said we'd get every dime of money that was used to rescue the financial system  we have  with interest  i promised we'd repeal  don't ask  don't tell  today  you can't be kicked out of our military because of who you love  i said i'd make sure that americans don't go bankrupt when they get sick  and we passed obamacare  and it was the right thing to do  i promised that we'd get help to young people so they could afford college  and we have  i bet on american workers and american ingenuity and saved a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world  on issue after issue  we are moving forward  after losing   million jobs in the great recession  our businesses have now added more than   million new jobs in the last   years  the unemployment rate is falling  manufacturing is coming back  our assembly lines are humming  housing prices are beginning to rise  we've got a long way to go  virginia  but we've come too far to come back now  we can't afford to go backwards to the same policies that got us into this mess  we've got to go forward with the policies that are getting us out of this mess  and that's why i'm running for a second term  and that's why i need your help  i've got a plan that will actually create jobs  not just talk about creating jobs  a plan that will actually create middle class security  not just use the words but not deliver on the promise  unlike my opponent  i'm actually proud to talk about what's in my plan  because the arithmetic works  if you want to take a careful look at it  go to barackobama com plans  i want you to share it with your friends and your neighbors and your coworkers  there's still people out there who are undecided  trying to make up their minds  maybe somebody in this crowd got dragged by your girlfriend or your boyfriend  your grandma said  you got to go to the obama rally  and you said  all right  grandma  but you're not yet convinced  take a look at this plan  compare it to what governor romney's plans are  see which plan you think is better for you  i want you to have the information you need to make an educated choice about this issue  about america's future and your own  the first thing in my plan  i want to end tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to give those tax breaks to companies that are investing in richmond  investing in virginia  helping small businesses and manufacturers create jobs right here at home  that's a priority  number two  i want to cut our oil imports in half by   so we control more of our own energy  because of what we've done to increase oil production and natural gas production  to invest in clean coal technology  to make sure that we're also investing in the clean energy source of the future like wind and solar and biofuels  we  today  are less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades  we passed regulations to make sure that fuel standards on cars and trucks are doubled so that you'll go twice as far on a gallon of gas  and that will save you money  that's good for our national security  it's good for our environment  i want to build on that progress  i don't want the cars of the future  long lasting batteries  wind turbines  solar panels  i don't want them made in china  i want them made right here in virginia  i want to put people back to work here in the united states  we can do that  number three  i want to make it a national mission to educate our young people  to train our workers  i want to recruit   math and science teachers  we've got to step it up when it comes to math and science and technology  i want to train   million workers in our outstanding community colleges so they've got the skills to get the jobs that are out there right now  and i want to work with colleges and universities to cut the growth of tuition in half  i want to make sure that young people are not burdened with debt when they're pursuing the education they need to compete  we can do that  number four  my plan will cut the deficit by   trillion over the next   years in a balanced way  yes  we're going to cut spending we don't need  we've already cut a trillion dollars  but i'm going to ask the wealthiest to pay a little bit more so we can invest in the research and technology that will keep new jobs and businesses coming to america  and in the process of making sure that we're reducing our deficit  i'm not going to turn medicare into a voucher program  no american should spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  and you know what i think we've seen again this week i don't think any male politician should be making health care decisions for women  i don't think your boss or your insurance company should be making those decisions for you either  i believe women are capable and should make their own health care decisions for themselves  that's why the health care law we passed puts those choices in your hands  where they belong  that's where they are to stay as long as i'm president of the united states of america  finally  i'll use the savings from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan to put our people back to work to do some nation building here at home  fixing our roads and our bridges  repairing our schools  laying out broadband lines into rural communities so they can compete in the global economy  and when our veterans come home  we are going to make sure we've got the resources to serve them as well as they've served us  because nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads or the care they need when they come home  this is the plan we need  virginia  this is how you build a strong  sustainable economy  this is how you create good  middle class jobs  this is how you encourage new businesses to start here and to stay here  this is how you increase take home pay  this is how you build an economy where everybody who works hard has a chance to get ahead  that's what we can do together  but it's up to you  virginia  you're going to have to make a choice  it's up to the young people here to decide what kind of future you want for yourselves  it's up to the not so young people like me and some of you i laughter i to make sure we make the right choice for future generations  sure  we can choose the top down policies that got us into this mess  but i think we have to choose the policies that are getting us out of this mess  you can choose a foreign policy that's wrong and reckless  or you can choose one that's steady and strong  you can choose to turn back the clock   years for women and immigrants and gays  or in this election  you can stand up for that basic principle  enshrined in our founding documents  that we're all created equal  that everybody has a voice in america  that it doesn't matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or who you love black or white  hispanic  asian  native american  young  old  rich  poor  gay  straight  abled or disabled it doesn't matter  you have a place in america  you can make it if you try  that's what's best in our country  that's what we're fighting for  virginia  we've been through some tough times  but we always bounce back  because the american people are always tougher than any tough times  we always come out on top because we pull together  because we look after one another  because we don't leave people behind  we don't close the door behind us if we're successful  we open it up a little wider so folks can walk through  we don't turn back  we look forward at that distant horizon  at the next destination  our destiny is not written for us  it's written by us  and we're going to write that next chapter together  that's why i'm asking for your vote in this election  that's why i'm asking for your vote  and i promise you  if you give me   more years  you'll have a president who always hear your voice  a president who will always fight for you and your family  a president who spends every waking hour trying to make your lives just a little bit better  virginia  i believe in you  i'm asking you to keep believing in me  and if you're willing to roll up your sleeves with me and work with me  knock on some doors with me  make some phone calls with me  we'll win richmond  we'll win the commonwealth of virginia again  we'll win this election  we'll finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states

also had a chance to see the two candidates and the two perspectives  you've heard governor romney's sales pitch   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  he's been running around saying he's got a five point plan for the economy  except it turns out that it's just a one point plan  a sketchy deal that says folks at the very top get to play by a different set of rules

it sounds familiar  it's because that's the philosophy that created a great recession  we tried that in the last decade  and it didn't work  it led to falling incomes and the slowest job growth in

economic plan is likely to create jobs in china  not america  because it rewards companies that ship jobs overseas  he's hoping you won't remember he wants to give millionaires and billionaires a

there's a sudden fuzziness when it comes to the policies on your web site  don't worry  because this is a curable condition i laughter i and obamacare covers preexisting conditions  we can make you well  there's a cure  you just have to vote   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  tampa  we joke about romnesia  but all of this speaks to something that's really important in this election  and that is the issue of trust  when you elect a president  you're counting on somebody you can trust to fight for you  who you can trust to do what they say they're going to do  who can trust that you can trust to make sure that when something unexpected happens  he or she is going to be thinking about your families  your future  trust matters  and  florida  you know me  you know i say what i mean and i mean what i say  we haven't finished all the work that we set out to do in   but every single day when i set foot in that oval office  i'm thinking about you  i'm fighting for your families  and with your help  i've kept the commitments that i made  i told you i'd end the war in iraq  i did  i said we'd transition out of afghanistan  and we are  i said we'd go after those who actually attacked us on   al qaida is on the path to defeat  usama bin laden is dead  a new tower is rising over the new york skyline  our heroes are coming home  i've kept those promises  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  and we have  i promised to cut taxes for small businesses  and we have  i promised to end wall street taxpayer funded bailouts  we have  i promised to repeal  don't ask  don't tell  so anybody can serve in our military regardless of who they love  i have  i promised that we would pass health care reform so nobody goes bankrupt when they get sick  we have  i promised to preserve medicare  we have  i bet on american workers and american ingenuity  and we saved an auto industry that is resurgent  on issue after issue  we're moving forward  we lost   million jobs in the great recession  but over the last   months  our businesses have added more than   million new jobs  unemployment is falling  manufacturing is coming back  our assembly lines are humming again  we've got a long way to go  but  florida  we've come too far to turn back now  we can't afford to go back to the same policies that got us into the mess  we've got to stick with the policies that are getting us out of the mess  and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  i've got a plan that will actually create jobs  a plan that will actually create middle class security  and unlike mitt romney  i'm proud to talk about that plan  because the math actually adds up  i want you all to take a look at it  you can go to barackobama com plans  and i want you to share those plans with your friends and neighbors and coworkers  there are still people out there who are trying to make up their minds  there might even be some here who are trying to make up their minds  maybe  no  no  maybe your girlfriend said  you've got to come   i laughter i  she's smart enough  she's already voting for obama  but you need some persuading  so i ask you to compare my plan to governor romney's plan  see which plan where's my plan oh  it dropped i laughter i i couldn't find my plan  there it is  now  this is the same plan that's on the web site  and you should look and see which plan is better for you  it's got details in here about how we can move the country forward  first  i want to end tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas  give them to companies that are investing and creating jobs right here in the united states of america  number two  i want to cut our oil imports in half by   so we control more of our own energy  right here in florida  we are seeing solar and other new sources of energy  we've doubled clean energy in addition to increasing oil and natural gas production  today  we are less dependent on oil from foreign sources than any time in the last two decades  and by the way  we're also increasing fuel standards on cars and trucks so you'll go twice as far on a gallon of gas  i want to build on that progress  i don't want fuel efficient cars and long lasting batteries and wind turbines and solar panels made in china  i want them made right here in florida  i want them made right here in the united states with u s  workers  third  i want to make it a national mission to educate our kids and train our workers better than anybody else on earth  i want to recruit   new math and science teachers  i want to train   million workers at community colleges for the skills that businesses are hiring for right now  i want to work with our colleges to keep tuition low so that our young people aren't burdened with debt  we can do that  number four  i want to reduce our deficit by   trillion  but i want to do it in a balanced way  we'll cut out spending we don't need  but i'm going to ask the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more so we can invest in the research and technology and infrastructure that keeps new jobs and businesses coming to america  and i will never  under the guise of reducing the deficit  turn medicare into a voucher  because americans shouldn't have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  and by the way  while we're at it  as we saw again this week  i don't think any politician in washington most of whom are male should be making health care decisions for women  women can make those decisions themselves  i don't think your boss or your insurance company should be making those decisions  women should be making their own health care decisions  that's why the health care law we passed put those choices in your hands  that's where it belongs  and that's where it will stay as long as i am president of the united states  and finally  i'll use the savings from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan to put people back to work doing some nation building here at home  rebuilding our roads and our bridges  our broadband lines in the rural areas  fixing our schools up  when our veterans come home  i want to make sure they've got jobs waiting for them  we're going to serve them as well as they've served us  because nobody who's fought for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  that's the plan we need  florida  that's how you build a strong  sustainable economy that has good  middle class jobs  that's how you encourage businesses to start here and to stay here  that's how you're actually going to increase take home pay  that's how you build an economy where everybody who works hard has a chance  that's what we can do together  and now it's up to you  now it's up to you  right here in florida  today  you can choose the path that we go from here  it's up to the young people here to choose the future that you want to see  it's up to the not so young people to choose the kind of country we leave for the future generations  you can choose the top down policies that got us into this mess  or you can choose the policies that are getting us out of this mess  you can choose a foreign policy that's reckless and wrong  or you can choose one that's steady and strong  you can choose to turn back the clock   years for women and for immigrants and for gays  or in this election  you can stand up for that basic principle that makes our country the envy of the world  that we're all created equal  that everybody has a place  black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  young  old  black  white  gay  straight  it doesn't matter  no matter who you are  no matter you look like  no matter where you come from  no matter who you love  in america  you've got to be able to make it if you try  that's what we believe  that's what we're fighting for  florida  we have been through tough times these past   years  i meet folks all the time who tell me how tough times have been  and there are a lot of folks where times are still tough  but the good news is  americans  we're always tougher  we always bounce back  we always come out on top  because we pull together  because we look after one another  because we leave no one behind  we don't close the door behind us if we succeed  we make sure that we're bringing more folks through that door  because we don't turn back  we go forward   i adelante i  we look forward to a future that is brighter  we look at the distant horizon  and we say  that's where we're headed  in america  our destiny is not written for us  it's written by us  and we can write that next chapter together  so  florida  that's why i'm asking for your vote in this election   i applause i  that's why i'm asking for your vote  and if i have the privilege of serving as your president for another   years  i promise you will always have a president who hears your voices  you'll always have a president who fights for your families  you'll have a president who spends every waking hour thinking about how i can make your lives just a little bit better  make the future of your children and grandchildren a little bit brighter  florida  i believe in you  i'm asking you to keep believing in me  and if you're willing to work with me and knock on some doors with me  make some phone calls with me  vote for me  we'll win hillsborough county again  we'll win florida again  we'll win this election again  we'll finish what we started in   and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  ohio  are you fired up  are you ready to go  i can't hear you  are you fired up   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  are you ready to go   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  i am glad to be back in cleveland  ohio  we've got two extraordinary representatives who are here  betty sutton and marcy kaptur  give them a big round of applause  it's great to see all of you who are here   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  this i love you back  this is the final stop on our  hour fly around all across america  we've been going for   days straight  we've been from the east coast to the west coast  and now we're going back east again  we just made a quick stop in chicago so i could vote  i can't tell you who i voted for because it's a secret ballot   i laughter i  but michelle told me she voted for me  so  ohio  i got to tell you  even though i've been going for about   hours straight  even though my voice is getting kind of hoarse  i've still got a spring in my step  because our cause is right  because we're fighting for the future  i've come to ohio today to ask you for your vote   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  and the good news is i'm asking for your vote and i'm asking you to vote early  here in ohio  you can vote now  you don't have to vote later  i need you to vote early  and i need your help to keep moving america forward  look  we've already now had three debates  we've had a year of campaigning  we have had way too many tv commercials  i feel bad for the state of ohio  you've had a lot of commercials   i laughter i  you've now heard governor romney's sales pitch   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  no  no  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  but governor romney has been running around saying he's got a five point plan to fix the economy  turns out  it's only a one point plan  folks at the very top get to play by a different set of rules than you do  they get to pay a lower tax rate  outsource more jobs  let wall street run wild again  it was the philosophy he had when he was in the private sector  it was the philosophy he had as a governor in massachusetts  and if it sounds familiar  it's because we just tried that philosophy in the decade before i took office  and we know what happened  it didn't work  jobs were being shipped overseas at a record pace  incomes were falling  record deficits  the slowest job growth in half a century  incomes were not going up  they were going down  the worst economic crisis since the great depression  that's what those ideas produced  and we've been working for   years now  ohio  to clean up the mess that those policies left behind  now  governor romney understands this  he knows his plan is no different than what we tried under the previous president  so in the final weeks of this election  since he knows that it's probably not going to be real popular  he's trying to kind of fuzz things up a little bit  he's counting on you to forget  he's hoping that you come down with what we call a case of   i audience members i  romnesia   i the president   i romnesia   i laughter i  he's hoping you won't remember that his economic plan is more likely to create jobs in china than here in ohio  because it rewards companies that ship jobs overseas instead of companies that are creating jobs right here in ohio  right here in the united states of america  he's hoping you won't remember that he wants to give millionaires and billionaires a   tax cut  and the reason he can't explain it is because the only way to pay for it is either by blowing a hole in the deficit  making it even bigger  or making your taxes higher   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  he's hoping that if he just keeps on saying how much he loves cars over and over again i laughter i that you won't remember he wrote an article titled that was titled  let detroit go bankrupt   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i mean  i don't know how a guy sits on a stage  talking to tens of millions of fellow americans  and you are saying somehow that you were all for the auto industry when everybody remembers you weren't  the people of detroit remember  the people of ohio remember  if mitt romney had been president when the auto industry was on the verge of collapse  we might not have an american auto industry today  we'd be buying cars from china instead of selling cars to china  the auto industry supports one in eight ohio jobs  it's a source of pride to this state  it's a source of pride for generations of workers  i refused to walk away from those workers  i refused to walk away from those jobs  i wasn't going to let detroit go bankrupt or toledo go bankrupt or lordstown go bankrupt  i bet on american workers  i bet on american manufacturing  and i'd do it again  because that bet always pays off  so now  in the closing moments of the election  governor romney is hoping you  too  will come down with a severe case of romnesia   i audience members i  no   i the president i  so i'm here to tell you  cleveland  if you start feeling a temperature  if your eyes are getting a little blurry and your hearing is getting a little muffled  if you're feeling a little weak  you need to know that whatever the symptoms are  don't worry  obamacare covers preexisting conditions  we can fix you up  we can make you well  there's a cure  ohio  you just have to make sure to vote  you got to vote   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  look  we joke about romnesia  but it's not funny because it speaks to something serious  it has to do with trust  there's no more serious issue in a presidential campaign than trust  trust matters  you know what  ohio  after all these years you now know me  you know that i mean what i say and i say what i mean  you know that i've been willing to take some tough positions even when they're not popular  and by the way  saving the auto industry wasn't popular when we were doing it  even in ohio  even in michigan  but it was the right thing to do  you know that every single day when i get up in the morning  i'm thinking about you  when i walk into that oval office  i'm fighting for your families  and we may not have gotten every single thing done that we need to get done  but i have kept the commitments and the promises that i made  i told you i'd end the war in iraq  and we did  i said we'd transition out of afghanistan  and we are  i said we'd refocus on the terrorists who actually carried out the   attacks  and al qaida is decimated  and usama bin laden is dead  we kept those promises  a new tower is rising above the new york skyline  our heroes are starting to come home  i've kept those promises  i was proud and humbled to learn today that we have colin powell's support in this campaign  and i'm grateful to him because of his lifetime of service for his country  as a soldier and as a diplomat  but i'm also grateful to every brave american who serves in uniform  and they should know this  as long as i'm your commander in chief  i will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known  that's a promise i've kept  four years ago  i promised to cut taxes for families like yours  for middle class families  we kept that promise  i promised to cut taxes for small businesses  we've cut taxes for small businesses   times  i kept that promise  i promised to end taxpayer funded bailouts for wall street  i've kept that promise  and we got every dime back that we used to rescue the financial system  i promised that we would make sure that nobody in this great country of ours goes bankrupt if somebody in their family gets sick  we've kept that promise  i promised to repeal  don't ask  don't tell  because anybody who is willing to serve our country should be able to with honor and dignity regardless of who they love  i kept that promise  i said that we would keep the american auto industry going  and today  its engines are roaring at full throttle  nearly   new jobs  not just something the midwest can be proud of  something america can be proud of  we're moving forward  ohio  after losing   million jobs in the great recession  using the policies that mitt romney now wants to bring back that caused all those jobs to be lost  we've now added  using my policies  more than   million new jobs in the past   years  the unemployment rate has fallen  manufacturing is coming back to our shores  assembly lines are humming again  we've got a long way to go  but  ohio  we've come too far to turn back now  we can't go backwards to the policies that caused us so much trouble  that hurt so many families  we've got to stick to the policies that are getting out getting us out of this mess  i need you  ohio  america needs you  ohio  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  ohio  i don't want your vote just because of what i have done  i want your vote because of what i'm going to do  i've got a plan that will actually create jobs  a plan that will actually create middle class security  and unlike mr  romney  i'm proud to talk about what is actually in my plan because my plan adds up  the math works  if you want to take a look  go to barackobama com plans  i want you to share it with your neighbors  share it with your friends  share it with your coworkers  there are still people out there who are trying to make up their minds  some of you may be still trying to make up your mind   i audience members i  no   i the president i  no  no  maybe your girlfriend brought you here  and she said  i'm going to convince you tonight you need to vote for obama  but you haven't made up your mind yet  maybe your grandma said   you need to vote for obama  and you said   okay  grandma  i'll come  but you're not yet sure  so i want you to look at this plan  compare my plan to governor romney's  i'm not scared of the comparison  i want you to know what's in my plan and what's in his and see what's better for you and your family and for america  look  here's what's in my plan  i want to end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas  i want to reward small businesses and manufacturers who create jobs right here in ohio  right here in the united states of america  number two  i want to cut our oil imports in half by   so we control more of our own energy  we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last two decades  and we're producing jobs doing it  and one reason  by the way  is because we increased fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks made right here in america so your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  i don't want fuel efficient cars or long lasting batteries or wind turbines or solar panels built in china  i want them built here  i want them manufactured in cleveland  i want them made in ohio  i want them stamped with  made in america  we can do that  now  i also want to make sure that our kids and our workers are better trained than everybody else  we've got to make this a national mission  i want to recruit   math and science teachers to make sure our kids are at the cutting edge  i want to train   million workers at community colleges so they have the skills for the jobs that are there right now and the jobs of the future  i want to work to make sure that colleges and universities keep tuition down so our young people aren't burdened with debt  we can do that  number four  my plan will cut the deficit by   trillion over the next   years  we need to do that  but we need to do it in a balanced way  we can do it without sticking it to the middle class  i'm going to cut out spending that we don't need we've already cut a trillion dollars but i'm also going to ask the wealthiest among us to pay a little bit more so that we can invest in the research and technology to keep new jobs and businesses coming to america  and by the way  i'm not going to use deficit reduction as an excuse to turn medicare into a voucher system  because americans should not be spending their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies  and by the way  while we're on the topic of health care  we saw again this week  you don't want a bunch of politicians in washington  most of whom are male  making health care decisions for women  women can make those decisions themselves  that's what i stand for  that's what i'll continue to stand for as president of the united states of america  number five  as we are ending the war in iraq and afghanistan  i want to take some of the money that we save and put it to work doing some nation building here at home  we've got construction workers and folks in the trades who are at home right now  they're dying to get back to work  let's put them back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges  our schools all across america  let's train our veterans as they're coming home to get some of those jobs  let's make sure that we're giving them a chance to be police officers and firefighters and first responders  let's make sure our veterans  when they come home  are being served as well as they've served us  because nobody should have to fight for a job when you've fought for your country  you shouldn't have to fight for a roof over your heads when you've fought for your country  look  ohio  that's the plan we need  that's how you build a strong  sustainable economy  that's how you create good middle class jobs  that's how you encourage new businesses to start here and stay here  that's how you increase take home pay  that's how you give workers a chance  if they're willing to work hard  to build a better life for themselves  that's how you make sure that everybody has got a chance to get ahead  that's what we can do  but we can only do it together  and  ohio  i'm going to need you to do it  it's now up to you to choose the path that we take  it's up to the young people who are here to choose the future that you want  it's up to the not so young people like me and you you know who you are i laughter i to choose the future you want for the next generation  we can go back to the top down policies that we know in our gut won't work  or you can choose the policies that we know give us the prospect of broad based prosperity  you can choose a foreign policy like governor romney is offering that's reckless and wrong  or you can choose the kind of policy that i've implemented that is steady and strong  you can choose to turn back the clock   years for women and immigrants and gays  or in this election  you can stand up for that basic principle enshrined in our founding documents that all of us are created equal  all of us endowed with certain inalienable rights by our creator  that it doesn't matter whether you're black or white  hispanic  asian  native american  young or old  rich or poor  gay or straight  able or disabled  we all have a place in america  if you're willing to work hard  if you're willing to stand up  you can make it here in america if you try  that's what we're fighting for  that's who we are  listen  ohio  i know we've been through tough times  every day  i think about everybody out there all across the country who wants to work and is still looking for a job  whose homes may be still underwater or at risk of foreclosure  the folks out there who  at the end of the month  are sitting around the kitchen table  trying to figure out  how am i going to make all these bills  michelle and i understand it because we know what it's been like to have a tough time sometimes  but what i also know  and all of you remind me of this every day when i'm talking to the american people  we're tougher than tough times  we always bounce back  we always come out on top because we pull together  because we look out for one another  because we leave nobody behind  because we don't forget where we come from  because if we're successful  then we keep the door open for folks who are coming up from behind  because we don't look backwards  we look forward  we look at that distant horizon  we look at that new frontier  we are not afraid of the future  america  our destiny is not written for us  it's written by us  and we can write that next chapter together  and that's why i'm asking you for your vote in this election  and if you give me your vote  i promise you  you will continue to have a president who hears your voices  a president who fights for your families  a president who spends every waking hour trying to figure out how i can make sure that your lives are a little bit better and  more importantly  that all of our children's lives are a whole lot brighter  ohio  i believe in you   i audience member i  we believe in you   i the president i  and i need you to keep believing in me  and if you're willing to roll up your sleeves and work with me  knock on some doors with me  make some phone calls with me  we're going to win cuyahoga county  we're going to win ohio  we're going to win this election  we're going to finish what we started  we'll remind the world why

audience members i  yes   i the president i  are you ready to go   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  this is an unbelievable crowd  and this is what the weather is always like in late october in new hampshire    degrees and sunny  can everybody please give it up for your outstanding united states senator  jeanne shaheen  your next governor  maggie hassan  your next congresswoman  annie kuster  and i've just got to say something special about one of the most talented singers and songwriters that america has ever had  he has just been a great friend  this guy has been working his tail off on behalf of this campaign  i couldn't be prouder that he's working with us  james taylor  give him a big round of applause   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  ten days  new hampshire  ten days  ten days  and you'll be stepping into a voting booth and making a defining choice about the future of our country  not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties  it is a choice between two fundamentally different visions for america  we believe in the values that built the largest middle class  the strongest economy the world's ever known  the promise that hard work will pay off  the promise that responsibility will be rewarded  the idea at the core of this nation that no matter who you are  no matter where you come from  no matter what you look like  this is a country where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share  everybody plays by the same rules  that's what we believe here in america  we believe that we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights  we insist on personal responsibility  we don't believe anybody is entitled to success  we know we all have to earn it  we honor the strivers  the dreamers  the risk takers  everybody who has been the driving force behind our free enterprise system  the greatest engine of growth and prosperity the world's ever known  but we also believe that the true measure of prosperity is more than just a running tally of corporate balance sheets  quarterly profit reports  we measure prosperity not just by how many millionaires and billionaires we produce  we measure prosperity by how well a typical family is doing  by whether our kids are getting a great education and can go as far as their dreams and hard work will take us  we understand that in this country  people succeed when they've got a chance at a decent education  when they can learn new skills  and by the way  so do the businesses that hire them or the companies that they start  we believe our economy grows when we support research into medical breakthroughs or new technologies like clean energy and fuel efficient cars  we know that our country is stronger when we can count on affordable health insurance and medicare and social security  when we protect our kids from toxic dumping and mercury pollution  when there are rules in place to make sure that we aren't taken advantage of by credit card companies or mortgage lenders or unscrupulous financial institutions  we know we're better off when politicians in washington aren't allowed to make decisions about health care that women are perfectly capable of making for themselves  that's what we believe  that's the vision that we embrace   i audience member i  we believe in you   i the president i  i appreciate that   i laughter i  governor romney  now  he's got an entirely different view about what this country is about   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president   i vote  vote  he's been running around saying he's got a five point plan for the economy  turns out it's a one point plan   i laughter i  folks at the very top get to play by a different set of rules than you do  they get to pay lower tax rates  outsource jobs  they want to let wall street run wild and make reckless bets with other folks' money  that was his philosophy when he was a ceo  that was his philosophy as governor  and as president clinton said  he does have a lot of brass  because he's now talking about big change  but all he's offering is a big rerun of the same policies that created so much hardship for so many americans  and governor romney's been out here making a lot of last minute promises lately  said he's all about fighting for the middle class  says he'd cut taxes for everybody  and asks something from nobody  but the problem is we've heard those promises before  now  keep in mind  governor romney lives just a few miles south of here in the state of massachusetts  love massachusetts  so i applause i  but during governor romney's campaign for governor down there  he promised the same thing he's promising now said he'd fight for jobs and middle class families  but once he took office  he pushed through a tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited   of the wealthiest families in the state  and then he raised taxes and fees on middle class families to the tune of   million  does that sound familiar to you   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  now  when he's asked about this  he says  no these weren't taxes  these were fees   i laughter i  but keep in mind  there were higher fees to be a barber  higher fees to become a nurse  there were higher fees for gas  there were higher fees for milk  there were higher fees for blind people who needed to get a certificate that they were blind  he raised fees to get a birth certificate  which would have been expensive for me   i laughter i  he raised fees for marriage certificates and fees for funeral homes  so there were literally cradle to grave tax hikes and fees   i laughter i  and when he left office  there were only three states in the country that had created fewer jobs than massachusetts  and by the way  one of them was louisiana that had been hit by hurricane katrina   i laughter i  he talked a lot about small businesses  still talks about it  says  i'm a business guy  i know about small businesses  massachusetts  when he was governor  ranked  th in small business creation  and one of the two states that ranked lower was louisiana that had gotten hit by hurricane katrina  so this is a guy who has a track record of saying one thing and doing something else  on the other hand  when i ran   years ago  i made promises too  i promised to cut taxes for middle class families  and i did  by   i promised to cut taxes for small business owners  and i did   times  i promised to end taxpayer funded wall street bailouts  and we have  and by the way  we got every dime worth of money that we used for the bank rescue  and we got interest with it too  i promised to take on those financial institutions that were charging too much for student loans  and we  as a consequence  were able to make college more affordable for millions of americans  i promised i'd never walk away from the millions of jobs that were in jeopardy when the auto industry was on the brink of collapse  we decided to ignore governor romney's business advice when he said detroit should go bankrupt  and now  america  we are building the best cars on earth  four years ago  i promised to end the war in iraq  and we did  i promised that we would begin the transition in afghanistan  and we are  i said we'd go after the terrorists who attacked us on   and thanks to the brave men and women in uniform  the courage of our navy seals  al qaida is on the path to defeat  and usama bin laden is dead  after losing   million jobs under the theories that governor romney is now promoting  our businesses under the ideas we've been working with have added more than   million new jobs over the last   years  manufacturing  highest job growth in manufacturing since the  s  the unemployment rate is falling  manufacturing's coming back to our shores  our assembly lines are humming again  housing prices are starting to pick up  housing starts are on the move  we've got a lot of work to do  but  new hampshire  the country has come too far for us to turn back now  we can't afford to go back to the policies that got us into this mess  we've got to continue with the policies that are getting out of the mess  we've got to move forward  and that's why i am running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now   i audience member i  you can do it  mr  president   i the president i  well  i'm going to do it with you  we can do it together  now  unlike governor romney's plan he doesn't like to talk about it too much i have a plan that will actually create jobs  that will actually lower our deficit and will actually provide the middle class with a greater sense of security  and the good news is my plan  the math actually adds up  if you want to check it out  you can go to barackobama com plans  and i want you to share it with your friends and your neighbors and your coworkers  there are still people out there who are trying to make up their minds  some of you who are here may be trying to make up your mind  maybe your girlfriend dragged you out here   i laughter i  no  no  maybe grandma said  you've got to go to the obama rally i laughter i and you're still trying to figure it out  so i'm asking you to compare my plan with governor romney's  i want you to know what we're proposing  each of us  and see which plan is better for you and what is better for the future of america  so number one  i want to end tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to reward small businesses and manufacturers who are putting down roots here  hiring american workers  creating american products stamped with three proud words  made in america  we can bring those jobs back to our shores  number two  i want to cut our oil imports in half by   so we control more of our own energy  because of the work we've already done increasing oil production  increasing natural gas production  but also emphasizing renewables like solar and wind and biofuels today  we are less dependent on foreign oil than at in any time in the last two decades  that's good for your pocketbook  that's good for our national security  it's good for the environment  and one reason we've been able we have confidence we can keep on making progress is we've doubled the fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks  so in the middle of the next decade  you'll go twice as far on a gallon of gas  i want us now to build on that progress  we've got to keep making those investments  i don't want fuel efficient cars and long lasting batteries and wind turbines and solar panels produced in china  i want them produced right here in new hampshire  i want them made right here in america  and we can do that  number three  we have to make it a national mission to educate our kids and train our workers better than anybody else in the world  i want to recruit   new math and science teachers because we know that's an area where we can't afford to fall behind  i want to train   million workers at our community colleges for the skills that businesses are hiring for right now  and i want to work with colleges and universities to make sure that tuition does not keep on going up  because our young people can't afford the debt that they are taking on  and that's something we can do  number four  my plan will reduce the deficit by   trillion over the next   years in a balanced way  we're going to cut out spending we don't need  we've already cut out a trillion dollars' worth of spending  we can do more  but i'm also going to ask the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more so we can invest in the research and technology and education that will keep new jobs and businesses coming to america  and under the guise of reducing the deficit  i will never turn medicare into a voucher system  because no american should have to spend their golden years at the mercy of an insurance company  and by the way i think we saw just this past week we don't need a whole bunch of politicians in washington  most of whom are male  making health care decisions for women  i don't think your boss or your insurance company should be making those decisions either  i believe women should be making their own health care decisions for themselves  that's why the health care law we passed put those choices in your hands  where they belong  and that's where they'll stay as long as i'm president of the united states  now  finally  number five  we're going to use the savings from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan to put our people back to work  let's do some nation building here at home  let's rebuild our roads and our bridges  our schools  let's lay broadband lines into rural communities all across the country  and as we're doing that  we're going to be putting our veterans back to work  we've got to serve them as well as they've served us  because nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads or the care that they've earned when they come home  so that's the plan we need  new hampshire  that's how you build a strong  sustainable economy  that's how you make sure that middle class jobs that pay a good wage are out there  that's how you encourage new businesses to start here and stay here in america  that's how you increase take home pay  not just by talking about it  that's how you build an economy where everybody who works hard can get ahead  and that's what we can do together  but here's the thing  new hampshire  it's now up to you  it's your choice  it's up to the young people who are here to choose a future that is worthy of all your dreams  it's up to the not so young people here  including me i'm included in that category i laughter i to make sure we're leaving the kind of america we want for future generations  you can choose the top down policy that got us into this mess  but i think we need to build on the policies that are helping us to make real progress all across this country  you can choose a foreign policy that's reckless and wrong  or you can choose the kinds of leadership that i've provided that's steady and strong  you can choose to turn back the clock   years for women and immigrants and gays  or in this election  you can stand up for that basic principle enshrined in our founding documents that all of us are created equal  black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  young  old  rich  poor  gay  straight  abled  disabled  no matter who you are  no matter what you look like  no matter where you come from  you've got a place in america  you can make it here if you try  that's what we believe  new hampshire  we've been through tough times  but we've been through tough times before and we are tougher  we always come out on top  we always bounce back because we pull together  because we look after one another  because we don't leave anybody behind  because when we succeed  we prop that door open and bring those who are following behind us  we pull them through  that's who we are  our destiny is not written for us  it's written by us  we don't go backward  we look forward to that distant horizon  to that new frontier  we imagine a better america  and then we work hard to make it happen  that's who we are  that's why i'm asking for your vote  and if you give me your vote  i promise you  you will always have a president who hears your voices  who will fight for your families  who will spend every waking moment thinking about how to make your lives a little bit better  new hampshire  i still believe in you  i need you to keep believing in me  and if you're willing to work with me and roll up your sleeves with me  knock on some doors with me  make some phone calls for me  we'll win hillsborough county again  we'll win new hampshire again  we'll finish what we started  and we'll remind the world why the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  wisconsin  it is good to be back in green bay  wisconsin  i want to thank all of you for giving such a warm welcome to a bears fan  and i especially want to thank one of the greatest defensive players in nfl history for being here today  charles woodson  and i want to thank charles  because i understand he made an announcement about a gift to the red cross to help support everybody over on the east coast  and that's the kind of guy he is  so we're grateful to him  thank you  charles  let's also give it up for your next united states senator  tammy baldwin  she's going to be following leaders like herb kohl and russ feingold in being fierce fighters for the people of wisconsin  so i applause i  now  for the past few days  all of us have been focused on one of the worst storms in our lifetimes  and we're awed and we're humbled by nature's destructive power  we mourn the loss of so many people  our hearts go out to those who have lost their loved ones  we pledge to help those whose lives have been turned upside down  and i was out in new jersey yesterday and saw the devastation  and you really get a sense of how difficult this is going to be for a lot  a lot of people  but we've also been inspired these past few days  because when disaster strikes  we see america at its best  all the petty differences that consume us in normal times all seem to melt away  there are no democrats or republicans during a storm  there are just fellow americans  leaders of different parties working to fix what's broken  neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy  communities rallying to rebuild  a spirit that says  in the end  we're all in this together  that we rise or fall as one nation  as one people  that spirit has guided this country along its improbable journey for more than two centuries  it's carried us through the trials of the last   years  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  today  our businesses have created over   million new jobs  the american auto industry is back on top  american manufacturing is growing at the fastest pace in   years  we're less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in   years  home values are on the rise  thanks to the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is winding down  al qaida has been decimated  usama bin laden is dead  so we've made real progress these past   years  but  wisconsin  we know our work's not done yet  as long as there's a single american who wants a job  but can't find one  our work isn't done  as long as there are families who are working harder  but falling behind  our work isn't done  as long as there's a child languishing in poverty  barred from opportunity  anywhere in this country  our work is not yet done  our fight goes on because we know this nation cannot succeed without a growing  thriving middle class and strong  sturdy ladders into the middle class  our fight goes on because america has always done its best when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why you elected me in   and that's why i'm running for a second term as president  because we've got more work to do   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  we knew from the beginning that our work would take more than one year or even one term because let's face it  the middle class was getting hammered long before the financial crisis hit  technology made us more productive  but it also made a lot of good jobs obsolete  global trade brought us cheaper products  but it also allowed companies to hire in low wage countries  american workers saw their paychecks squeezed even as corporate profits rose and ceo salaries exploded and the guaranteed security of pensions and health care slowly started disappearing  and these fundamental changes in the economy the rise of technology and global competition they're real  we can't wish these challenges away  but here's what i know  wisconsin  we can meet them  because we're americans  we've got the world's best workers and the best entrepreneurs  we've got the best scientists and the best researchers  the best colleges and universities  and we've got the most innovative spirit  we have everything we need to thrive in this new economy  in this new century  and there's not a country on earth that wouldn't trade places with the united states of america  but we have a choice to make  in   days  we will choose our next president  and it's more than just a choice between two candidates or two parties  you'll be making a choice between two fundamentally different visions of america  one where we return to the top down policies that crashed our economy   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  wisconsin  vote  or a future that's built on a strong and growing middle class  and  wisconsin  we know what the choice needs to be  we're here today because we believe that if this country invests in the skills and ideas of its people  then good jobs and businesses will follow  we believe that america's free market has been the engine of america's progress  driven by risk takers and innovators and dreamers  but we also understand that in this country  people succeed when they've got a chance to get a good education and learn new skills and  by the way  so do the businesses that hire those people or the companies that those folks start  we believe that when we support research into medical breakthroughs or new technology  then entire new industries will start here and stay here and hire here  we don't believe government should poke its nose into everything we do  but do we believe this country is stronger when there are rules to protect our kids from toxic dumping and mercury pollution  when there are rules to protect consumers and ordinary families from credit card companies that are engaging in deceptive practices  mortgage lenders that are unscrupulous  we grow faster when our tax code rewards hard work and companies that create jobs here in america  and we believe that quality  affordable health care and a dignified retirement aren't just achievable goals  they're a measure of our values as a nation  that's what we believe  for   years  we had a president who shared these beliefs  his name was bill clinton  when he was first elected  he asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little more  so we could reduce the deficit and still make investments in things like education and training  science and research  and guess what  plenty of folks who were running for congress at the time said it would hurt the economy  that it would kill jobs  and if that argument sounds familiar  one of those candidates back then happens to be running for president right now   i laughter i  and it turns out their math was just as bad back then as it is today  because by the end of bill clinton's second term  america had created   million new jobs  and incomes were up  and poverty was down  and our deficit became the biggest surplus in our history  so  wisconsin  we know the ideas that work  we also know the ideas that don't work  because in the   years after bill clinton left office  his policies were reversed  the wealthiest americans got tax cuts they didn't need and that we couldn't afford  companies enjoyed tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas  insurance companies and oil companies and wall street were given free license to do what they pleased  folks at the top got to play by a different set of rules than the rest of us  and the results of this top down economics was falling incomes  record deficits  the slowest job growth in half a century  and an economic crisis that we've been cleaning up for the last   years  now  in the closing weeks of this campaign  governor romney has been using all his talents as a salesman to dress up these very same policies that failed our country so badly  the very same policies we've been cleaning up after for the past   years  and he is offering them up as change   i laughter i  he's saying he's the candidate of change  well  let me tell you  wisconsin  we know what change looks like  and what the governor is offering sure ain't change  giving more power back to the biggest banks isn't change  leaving millions without health insurance isn't change  another   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy isn't change  turning medicare into a voucher is change  but we don't want that change   i laughter i  refusing to answer questions about the details of your policies isn't change  ruling out compromise by pledging to rubberstamp the tea party's agenda as president  that's definitely not change  in fact  that's exactly the attitude in washington that needs to go  now  here's the thing  wisconsin  after   years as president  you know me by now  you may not agree with every decision i've made  you may be frustrated at the pace of change  but you know what i believe  you know where i stand  you know i'm willing to make tough decisions  even when they're not politically convenient  and you know i'll fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  you know that  i know what change looks like  because i've fought for it  you have too  and after all we've been through together  we sure as heck can't give up now   i audience members i  no   i the president i  change is a country where americans of every age have the skills and education that good jobs now require  and government can't do this alone  but don't tell me that hiring more teachers won't help this economy grow or help young people compete  don't tell me that students who can't afford college should just borrow money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me  and i'll bet it wasn't an option for a whole lot of you  we shouldn't be ending college tax credits to pay for millionaires' tax cuts  we should be making college more affordable for everyone who's willing to work for it  we should recruit   math and science teachers so that high tech  high wage jobs aren't created in china  they're created right here in green bay  wisconsin  we should work with community colleges to train another   million americans with skills that businesses are looking for right now  that's my plan for the future  that's what change is  that's the america we're fighting for in this election  change comes when we live up to our legacy of innovation and make america home to the next generation of manufacturing  scientific discovery  technological breakthroughs  i'm proud i bet on american workers and american ingenuity and the american auto industry  and today  we're not just building cars again  we're building better cars  cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  today  there are thousands of workers building long lasting batteries and wind turbines and solar panels all across the country  jobs that weren't there   years ago  and sure  not all technologies we bet on will pan out  some of the businesses we encourage will fail  but i promise you this  there is a future for manufacturing here in america  there is a future for clean energy here in america  and i refuse to cede that future to other countries  i don't want tax codes rewarding companies for creating jobs overseas  i want to reward companies that create jobs here in america  i don't want a tax code that subsidizes oil company profits  i want to support the energy jobs of tomorrow and the new technologies that will cut our oil imports in half  that's my plan for jobs and growth  that's the future of america that i see  change is finally turning the page on a decade of war to do some nation building here at home  so long as i'm commander in chief  we will pursue our enemies with the strongest military the world's ever known  but it's time to use the savings from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan to start paying down our debts here and rebuilding america  right now we can put people back to work fixing up roads and bridges  right now we can expand broadband into rural neighborhoods and make sure our schools are state of the art  let's put americans back to work doing the work that needs to be done  and let's especially focus on our veterans  because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads or the care that they need when they come home  that's my plan to keep us strong  that's my commitment to you  and that's what's at stake in this election  change is a future where we reduce our deficit in a way that's balanced and responsible  i've signed a trillion dollars' worth of spending cuts  i intend to do more  and i'll work with both parties to streamline agencies and get rid of programs that don't work  but if we're serious about the deficit  we've also got to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the tax rates they paid when bill clinton was in office  because as long as i'm president  i will never turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i will never allow this nation to be plunged into another battle over health care reform just so insurance companies can jump back into the driver's seat  and i will never allow politicians in washington to control health care choices that women should be making for themselves  so  wisconsin  we know what change is  we know what the future requires  we don't need a big government agenda or a small government agenda  we need a middle class agenda that rewards hard work and responsibility  we don't need a partisan agenda  we need a commonsense agenda that says when we educate a poor child  we'll all be better off  that says when we fund the research of a young scientist  her new discovery will benefit every american  we need a vision that says we don't just look out for ourselves  we look out for one another other  we look out for future generations  and we meet those obligations by working together  that's the change we believe in  that's what this election is all about  now  let's be clear  achieving this agenda won't be easy  it's never been easy  we always knew that  back in   when we talked about change  i told you i wasn't just talking about changing presidents  i wasn't just talking about changing parties  i was talking about changing our politics  i ran because the voices of the american people your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long  by lobbyists and special interests and politicians who believe that compromise is somehow a dirty word  by folks who would say anything to win office and do anything to stay there  the protectors of the status quo are a powerful force in washington  and over the last   years  every time we've tried to make a change  they've fought back with everything they've got  they spent millions to stop us from reforming health care and wall street and student loans  and their strategy from the start was to engineer pure gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise on ideas that both democrats and republicans had supported in the past  and what they're counting on now  wisconsin  is that the american people will be so worn down by all the squabbling  so tired of all the dysfunction  that you'll actually reward obstruction and put people back in charge who advocate the very policies that got us into this mess   i audience members i  no   i the president i  in other words  their bet is on cynicism  but  wisconsin  my bet is on you  my bet is on the decency and good sense of the america people  because despite all the resistance  despite all the setbacks  we've won some great fights  and i've never lost sight of the vision we share  that you would have a voice  that there would be somebody at the table fighting every single day for middle class americans who work hard  sometimes  republicans in congress have worked with me to meet our goals  to cut taxes for small businesses and families like yours  to open new markets for american goods or finally repeal  don't ask  don't tell  and sometimes we've had big fights fights that were worth having like when we forced the banks to stop overcharging for student loans and made college more affordable for millions  like when we forced wall street to abide by the toughest rules since the  s  like when we stopped insurance companies from discriminating against americans with preexisting conditions like cancer or diabetes so that nobody in america goes bankrupt just because they get sick  i didn't fight those fights for any partisan advantage  i've shown my willingness to work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  and if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders whether they are democrats  republicans  or independents who feel the same way  but if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals that will kick students off of financial aid or get rid of funding for planned parenthood or eliminate health care for millions on medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled just to give a millionaire a tax cut  i'm not having it  that's not a deal worth having  that's not bipartisanship  that's not change  that's surrender to the same status quo that has hurt middle class families for way too long  and i'm not ready to give up on that fight  i hope you aren't either  wisconsin   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i hope you aren't either  see  the folks at the very top in this country don't need another champion in washington  they'll always have a seat at the table  they'll always have access and influence  the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day  the laid off furniture worker who is retraining at age   for a career in biotechnology  she needs a champion  the small restaurant owner who needs a loan to expand after the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and the waiters and the cleaning staff working overtime at a vegas hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who's back on the job  filled with pride and dignity because he's building a great car  he needs a champion  the young teacher doing her best in an overcrowded classroom with outdated textbooks  she needs a champion  all those kids in inner cities and small farm towns  in the valleys of ohio or rolling virginia hills or right here in green bay  kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors  engineers or entrepreneurs  diplomats or even a president  they need a champion in washington  they need a champion  they need a champion because the future will never have as many lobbyists as the past  but it's the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace  and that's why i need you  wisconsin  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we've come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint  now is the time to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids and train all our workers  to create new jobs and rebuild our infrastructure  to discover new sources of energy  to broaden opportunity  to grow our middle class  to restore our democracy  and to make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from or how you started out  you can work to achieve your american dream  in the midst of the great depression  fdr reminded the country that  failure is not an american habit  and in the strength of great hope we must shoulder our common load  that's the strength we need today  that's the hope i'm asking you to share  that's the future in our sights  that's why i'm asking for your vote  and if you're willing to work with me again and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls for me and turn out for me  we'll win brown county again  we'll win wisconsin again  we'll win this election  and together  we'll renew those bonds and reaffirm that spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  thank you  wisconsin  get out there and vote  thank you  god bless you  and god bless america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  nevada  it is great to be back in vegas  it's great to be here with your next senator  shelley berkley  who's going to join my great friend

mourning those who've been lost  and we're going to pledge to those whose lives have been turned upside down that we will not quit until we have given them all the help they need to recover  this afternoon  as i was flying out to vegas  we had conference calls with mayors all across new jersey  had conference calls with mayors and local elected officials all across connecticut  i spoke to the governors of new jersey  connecticut  and new york  and they're struggling  and the cleanup  the aftermath of this storm is going to be hard  and it's going to take some time  but the thing that i have repeated them to them every time i talk to them is  america will not forget them  we are going to make sure they get everything they need  we're going to cut through the redtape and the bureaucracy  we've got military transport getting equipment in to get the power back on  we've got food and water and medical supplies that we're shipping in  and we're not going to stop  because what we understand is  is that this could happen to any of us  and that's why  even in the midst of tragedy  the situation on the east coast has also inspired  because it reminds us that when disaster strikes we see america at its best  all the petty differences that consume us in normal times somehow melt away  there are no democrats or republicans during a storm  just fellow americans  leaders of different parties working to fix what's broken  neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy  communities rallying to rebuild  a spirit that says in the end  we're all in this together  that we rise

our work is not done as long as there's a single american who wants a job and can't yet find one  as long as there are families who are working harder and harder  but falling further behind  our work is not yet done  as long as there is a child languishing in poverty  barred from opportunity  anywhere in this country  anywhere in nevada  our work is not yet done  our fight goes on  because we know this nation can't succeed without a growing  thriving middle class and strong  sturdy ladders into the middle class  our fight goes on because america has always been at its best when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why you elected me in   and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  we knew from the beginning that our work would take more than one year or even one term  because  let's face it  the middle class was getting hammered long before the financial crisis hit  because the economy has changed  technology made us more productive  but it also made a lot of good jobs obsolete  global trade brought us cheaper products  but it also allowed companies to move and hire people in low wage countries  american workers saw their paychecks squeezed  even as corporate profits were rising and ceo salaries exploded  the guaranteed security of pensions and health care started slowly to disappear  and these fundamental changes in the economy the rise of technology and global competition these changes are real  we can't wish away these challenges  but here's what i know  nevada  we can meet these challenges  this is america  we've got the world's best workers and the world's best entrepreneurs  we've got the world's best scientists and the world's best researchers  we've got the best colleges and the best universities  and we've got the most innovative spirit  we've got everything we need to thrive in this new  st century economy  and there's not a country on earth that would not gladly trade places with the united states  but we've got a choice to make if we're going to realize that promise  if we're going to make sure that that success is there for the next generation  in   days  we will choose our next president  and  nevada  it's more than just a choice between two candidates  it's more than just a choice between two parties  you're going to be making a choice between two fundamentally different visions of america  on the one hand  we've got folks who are arguing to return to the top down policies that crashed our economy   i audience members i  no   i the president i  what we're talking about is a future that's built on a strong and growing middle class  nevada  we know the choice that needs to be made  and we're here today because we believe that if this country invests in the skills and ideas of its people  then good jobs and businesses will follow  we believe that america's free market has been the engine of america's progress  driven by risk takers and innovators and dreamers  folks in nevada know about dreaming  but we also understand that in this country  people succeed when they've got a shot at a good education  when they have a chance to learn new skills  and by the way  businesses benefit because they're hiring those workers  and some of those workers end up starting businesses of their own  we believe that when we support research into medical breakthroughs  research into new technology  entire new industries will start here and stay here and hire here  we don't believe government should poke its nose in everything we do  but we do believe this country is stronger when there are rules to protect our kids from toxic dumping and mercury pollution  when there are rules to protect consumers from unscrupulous credit card companies and mortgage lenders  we believe we grow faster when our tax code rewards hard work and companies that create jobs here in america  and we believe that quality health care for everybody and a dignified retirement for everybody aren't just achievable goals  they are a measure of our values as a nation  that's what we believe  for   years  we had a president who shared these beliefs  his name was bill clinton  and when he was elected  he asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little more so we could reduce the deficit and still make investments in things like education and training and science and research  and here's an interesting thing  plenty of folks who were running for congress at the time said it would hurt the economy  that raising taxes on the wealthy would kill jobs  and if that argument sounds familiar  one of those candidates who was running back then happens to be the guy who is running for president right now   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote  vote  turns out their math was just as bad back then as it is today i laughter i because by the end of bill clinton's second term  america had created   million new jobs  incomes were up  poverty was down  our deficit became the biggest surplus in history  so  nevada  we know our ideas work  we also know the ideas that don't work  because in the   years after bill clinton left office  his policies were reversed  the wealthiest americans got tax cuts they didn't need and we couldn't afford  companies enjoyed tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas  insurance companies and oil companies and wall street were given free license to do whatever they pleased  folks at the top got to play by a different set of rules than the rest of us  and the result of this top down economics was falling incomes  record deficits  the slowest job growth in half a century  and an economic crisis that we're still cleaning up after  so in the closing weeks of this campaign  governor romney has been using all his talents as a salesman to dress up the very same policies that failed our country so badly  the very same policies we've been cleaning up after over these   years  and with a straight face  he's offering them up as change   i laughter i  he's saying he's the candidate of change  now  let me tell you  nevada  we know what change looks like  and what the governor is offering sure ain't change  giving more power back to the biggest banks isn't change  leaving millions without health insurance isn't change  another   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy isn't change  refusing to answer questions about the details of your policies isn't change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  turning medicare into a voucher  that is change  but we don't want that change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  ruling out compromise by pledging to rubberstamp the tea party's agenda as president  that's definitely not change   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  in fact  that's exactly the attitude in washington that needs to go  so after   years as president  you know me by now  you may not agree with every decision i've made  you may be frustrated at the pace of change  but you know what i believe  you know where i stand  you know i'm willing to make tough decisions  even when they're not politically convenient  and you know that i will fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  so my opponent can talk about change  but i know what real change looks like  because i've fought for it  i've got the scars to proof it  you have too  and after all that we've been through together  nevada  we sure as heck can't give up now   i audience members i  no   i the president i  change is a country where americans of every age have the skills and education that good jobs require  and government can't do this alone  parents have to parent  teachers have to teach  but don't tell me that hiring more teachers won't help this economy grow or help young people compete  we know that it will  don't tell me that students who can't afford college should just borrow money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me  i'll bet it wasn't an option for a whole lot of you  we shouldn't be ending college tax credits just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut  we should be making college more affordable for everybody who's willing to work for it  we should recruit   math and science teachers so that high tech  high wage jobs aren't created in china  they're created right here in nevada  we should work with our community colleges to train another   million americans with the skills that businesses are looking for right now  that's my plan for the future  that's what change is  that's the america we're fighting for in this election  change comes when we live up to our legacy of innovation  when we make america home to the next generation of outstanding manufacturing  scientific discovery  technological breakthroughs  i am proud that i bet on american workers and american ingenuity and the american auto industry  today  we're not just building cars again  we're building better cars  cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  today  there are thousands of workers building long lasting batteries and wind turbines  installing solar panels all across the country  and those jobs  they weren't there   years ago  and sure  not all technologies we bet on will pan out  some of the businesses we encourage will fail  but i promise you this  there is a future for manufacturing in america  there's a future for clean energy in america  i refuse to cede that future to other countries  i don't want a tax code that rewards companies for creating jobs overseas  i want to reward companies that create jobs right here in the united states of america  i don't want a tax code that subsidizes oil company profits when they're already making money hand over fist  i want to support the energy jobs of tomorrow  the new technologies that will cut our oil imports in half  that's my plan for jobs and growth  that's the future that i see for america  change is finally turning the page on a decade of war to do some nation building right here at home  so long as i'm commander in chief  we will pursue our enemies with the strongest military the world has ever known  we will not let up  but it's time to use the savings from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan to start paying down our debt and rebuild america  right now we could be putting more folks back to work right now  fixing roads and bridges  expanding broadband to rural neighborhoods  making sure our schools are state of the art  let's put americans back to work doing the work that needs to be done  especially our veterans  because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  that's my commitment to you  that's what's at stake in this election  change is a future where  yes  we reduce our deficit  but we do it in a balanced  responsible way  i've already signed a trillion dollars' worth of spending cuts  i'll work with both parties to streamline agencies and get rid of programs that don't work  but if we're really serious about the deficit  then we've also got to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the tax rates they played they paid when bill clinton was president  because as long as i'm president  i am not going to turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i won't allow this nation to be plunged into another battle over health care reform just so insurance companies can jump back in the driver's seat  and i will never allow politicians in washington to control the health care choices that women should make for themselves  so  nevada  we know what change is  we know what the future requires  we don't need a big government agenda  or a small government agenda  we need a middle class agenda that rewards the values of hard work and responsibility  we don't need a partisan agenda  we need a common sense agenda that says when we educate a poor child  we'll all be better off  that says when we fund the research of a young scientist  her new discovery will benefit every american  we need a vision that says we don't just look out for ourselves  we look out for one another  we look out for future generations  we meet those obligations working together  that's the change we believe in  and that's what this election is all about  that's what this election is all about  now  nevada  let's be clear  achieving this agenda won't be easy  it's never been easy  we always knew it would be hard  back in   when we talked about change  i told you i wasn't just talking about changing presidents  i wasn't just talking about changing political parties  i was talking about changing our politics  i ran because the voices of the american people your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long  by lobbyists and special interests  by politicians who believed that compromise is a dirty word  by folks who would say anything to stay in office or win office or do anything to make sure that the special interests who support them get what they want  the protectors of the status quo are a powerful force in washington  and over the last   years  every time we've pushed to make change  they fought back with everything they've got  they spent millions to stop us from reforming health care  spent millions to fight us when we tried to reform wall street  their strategy from the start was to engineer pure gridlock  refusing to compromise on ideas that both democrats and republicans had supported in the past  and what they're counting on now is that the american people will be so worn down by all the squabbling in washington  so tired of all the dysfunction  that you'll actually reward their obstruction and put people back in charge who advocate the very same policies that got us into this mess   i audience members i  no   i the president i  in other words  their bet is on cynicism  but  nevada  my bet's on you   i applause i  my bet's on you  my bet is on the decency and good sense of the american people  because despite all the resistance  despite all the setbacks  we have never lost sight of the vision that we shared  that you'd have a voice  that there would be somebody at the table fighting every single day for middle class americans  for folks who are striving to get into the middle class  sometimes republicans in congress have worked with me to meet our goals  and nobody could be happier  we cut taxes for small businesses and families like yours  and they helped  we opened new markets for american goods  we finally repealed  don't ask  don't tell  and we had some courageous republican senators supporting us  but yes  we've also had some big fights  like when we forced the banks to stop overcharging for student loans and made college affordable for millions of students  like when we forced wall street to abide by the toughest rules since the  s  like when we stopped insurance companies from discriminating against americans with preexisting conditions like cancer or diabetes so that no one in america goes bankrupt just because they get sick   i audience member i  thank you   i the president i  i didn't fight those fights for any partisan advantage  i've shown my willingness to work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  and if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders whether they're democrats  republicans  independents who feel the same way  you'll vote for candidates like shelley berkley and dina titus and john oceguera and steve horsford  people who just want to fix problems and help america and work on behalf of hard working families like yours  but if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals that will kick students off of financial aid or get rid of funding for planned parenthood or eliminate health care for millions on medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled just to give a millionaire a tax cut  i'm not having it  that's not a deal worth having  that's not bipartisanship  that's not real change  that's surrender to the same status quo that's hurt middle class families for way too long  and i'm not ready to give up on the fight just yet  i'm not giving up on the fight  and i hope you aren't either  nevada  i hope you aren't either  i need you still fired up  the folks at the very top in this country  they don't need a champion in washington  they'll always have a seat at the table  they'll always have access and influence  that's okay  we understand that  but the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every single day  the laid off furniture worker who is retraining at the age of   after they got laid off  she needs a champion  the small restaurant owner who needs a loan to expand after the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and waiters and cleaning staff working overtime at a vegas hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who's back on the job after thinking he might never go back  filled with the pride and dignity of building a great american car  he needs a champion  the young teacher doing her best in an overcrowded classroom with outdated textbooks  digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies  never giving up on those kids  understanding that they can learn  she needs a champion  and all those young people in inner cities and small farm towns  in the valleys of ohio or rolling virginia hills or right here in vegas or way up in elko kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors  engineers or entrepreneurs  diplomats  maybe even a president they need a champion in washington  the future will never have as many lobbyists as the past  but it's the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace  and that's why i need you  nevada  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we've come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint  to go weary  now is the time to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids and train all our workers  to create new jobs and rebuild our infrastructure  to discover new sources of energy  to broaden opportunity  to grow our middle class  to restore our democracy  to make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from or how you started out  you can make it here in america  that's why we are moving forward  in the midst of the great depression  fdr reminded the country that  failure is not an american habit  and in the strength of great hope we must all shoulder our common load  that's the strength we need today   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  that's the hope i'm asking you to share  that's the future in our sight  that's why i'm asking you for your vote   i applause i  that's why i'm asking you  nevada  for your vote  and if you're willing to work with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls for me  if you're willing to turn out for me and grab some friends and neighbors for me  we'll win clark county again  we'll win nevada again  we'll win this election  and together  we'll renew the bonds and reaffirm the spirit that make the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america  let's go vote  let's get this done "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  boulder  thank you  are you fired up   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  are you ready to go   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  you seem pretty fired up  it is good to be back in colorado  everybody  please give savannah a big round of applause for the great introduction  let's give a shout out to the folks who are fighting for you every day in washington  senator michael bennet  senator mark udall  congressman jared polis  it is good to be here  thank you  now   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  i do  those of you who have seats  feel free to sit down  i don't want you guys getting tired out   i laughter i  for the past few days  all of us have been focused on one of the worst storms of our lifetime  and we're awed and humbled by nature's destructive power  we mourn those who were lost  obviously  our hearts and our thoughts and prayers go out to the families who've been affected  we pledge to help those whose lives have been turned upside down  i was just on a phone call with some of the local officials in new york  as well as governor cuomo  and they've got still a long way to go to deal with this incredible storm  but we've also been inspired these past few days  because when disaster strikes  we see america at its best  the petty differences that consume us in normal times  they all seem to melt away  we saw it here in colorado with the fires this summer and then the terrible tragedy in aurora  in moments like these  we're reminded there are no democrats or republicans during a crisis  just fellow americans  we see leaders of different parties working to fix what's broken and neighbors helping neighbors to cope with tragedy  communities rallying to rebuild  a spirit that says in the end  we're all in this together  we rise or fall as one nation  as one people  and  boulder  that spirit has guided this country along its improbable journey for more than two centuries  and it's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last   years  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  today  because of the resilience of the american people  our businesses have created over   million new jobs  the american auto industry is back on top  american manufacturing is growing at the fastest pace in   years  we're less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in   years  home values  home construction is on the rise  and thanks to the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is coming to an end  al qaida has been decimated  usama bin laden is dead  so we've made real progress these past   years  but  colorado  we all know our work's not yet done  as long as there's a single american who wants a job and can't find one  our work's not done  as long as there are families who are working harder and harder  but falling further behind  our work's not yet done  as long as there's a child somewhere in america languishing in poverty  barred from opportunity  anywhere in this country  our work is not yet done  our fight  our mission goes on because we know this nation cannot succeed without a growing  thriving middle class and strong  sturdy ladders into the middle class for everybody who's willing to work hard and take responsibility  our fight  our mission goes on because america has always done best when everybody has a fair shot  when everybody is doing their fair share  when everybody is playing by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why we you elected me in   and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  we knew from the beginning that our work would take more than one year or even one term  we knew that  because  let's face it  the middle class was getting hammered long before the financial crisis hit  the economy has changed over the last     years  technology has made us more productive  but it's also made a lot of good jobs obsolete  global trade brought us cheaper products  but it also meant that companies could locate overseas in low wage countries  american workers saw their paychecks getting squeezed even when corporate profits rose  even as ceo salaries exploded and the guaranteed security of pensions and health care started to erode  in some cases disappear altogether  now  these fundamental changes in the economy the rise of technology and global competition those are real  we can't wish them away  but here's what i know  colorado  we can meet those challenges  we're americans  we still have the world's best workers  we've got the world's best entrepreneurs  we've got the best scientists and researchers  we've definitely got the best colleges and universities  we've got the most innovative spirit  we have everything we need to thrive in this new economy  there's not a country on earth that wouldn't gladly trade places with the united states  but to realize our full potential  to secure a future that we want for our kids and our grandkids  we've got to make a choice right now  in   days  we will choose our next president  and  boulder  it is more than just a choice between two candidates or two parties  you're going to be making a choice between two fundamentally different visions of america  one where we return to the top down policies that crashed our economy   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote   i applause i  vote  or a future that's built on a strong and growing middle class  and we know what the choice needs to be  we're here today because we believe that if this country invests in the skills and ideas of its people  then good jobs and businesses will follow  we believe that america's free market has been the engine of america's progress  and we honor the risk takers and innovators and dreamers that drive our economy forward  but we also understand that in this country  people succeed when they have a chance at a great education  when they've got a chance to learn new skills  that's good for business because they need skilled workers  that's good for our country because some of those folks who get those great skills and education start new businesses  we believe that when we support research into medical breakthroughs or nanotechnology or entire new fields of study  new industries start here and they stay here and they hire here  we don't believe that government should poke its nose into everything we do  but we do we believe this country is stronger and actually our markets work better when there are rules in place to protect our kids from toxic dumping and mercury pollution  when there are rules to protect consumers from unscrupulous credit card companies and mortgage lenders  when we grow we're convinced that we grow faster  and the evidence is on our side  we grow faster when our tax code rewards hard work and companies that create jobs here in america  and we believe that quality health care for everybody and a dignified retirement for everybody aren't just achievable goals  they are a measure of our values as a nation  that's what we believe  for   years  we had a president who actually shared those beliefs  and his name was bill clinton  and the interesting thing is  when he was first elected  he asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little more so we could reduce the deficit and still make investments in things like education and training  and science and research  and guess what  there were a bunch of folks who were running for congress at the time who said this is going to hurt the economy  this is going to kill job creation  and if that argument sounds familiar  one of those candidates happens to be running for president right now   i laughter i  and it turns out  his math and their math was just as bad back then as it is now  because by the end of bill clinton's second term  america had created   million new jobs  and incomes were up  and poverty was down  and our deficits had become the biggest surplus in history  so  colorado  we know the ideas that work  we know our ideas work  we also know the ideas that don't work  because in the   years after bill clinton left office  his policies were reversed  the wealthiest americans got tax cuts they didn't need  companies enjoyed tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas  insurance companies and oil companies and wall street were

deficits and the slowest job growth in half a century and an economic crisis that we have been cleaning up for the last   years  so here's the thing  we've tested both theories  we've tested both visions  one worked really well  one worked really badly   i laughter i  now  in the closing weeks of this campaign  governor romney has been using all his formidable talents as a salesman i laughter i to dress up the very same policies that failed our country so badly  the very same policies we've been cleaning up after these last   years  and he's offering them up as change  he's saying he's the candidate of change  now   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  don't boo  vote  vote  but let me tell you  colorado  we know what change looks like  we know what's going to help the middle class  we know what's going to grow jobs  we know what's going to reduce the deficit  and let me tell you  what governor romney is offering sure ain't it  it is not it  giving more power back to the biggest banks  that's not change  leaving millions without health insurance  that's not change   i audience member i  no  it ain't   i the president i   i laughter i  another   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy  that's not change   i audience members i  no  it ain't   i the president i   i laughter i  refusing to answer questions about the details of your policies  not change   i audience members i  no  it ain't   i the president i   i laughter i  ruling out compromise by pledging to rubberstamp the tea party's agenda as president  that's not change   i audience members i  not change   i the president i  in fact  that's exactly the attitude in washington that we've got to change  look  i know that with all the tv commercials that are coming at people  sometimes  it's hard to follow stuff but and it's hard to know who to trust  but here's the thing  look  after   years as president  you know me by now   i applause i  you know me  you may not agree with every decision that i've made  you may be frustrated at the pace of change  i always remind people that when we did the auto bailout  only   percent of the country approved of it  including  by the way  folks in michigan and ohio  but you know what i believe  you know where i stand  you know i'm willing to make tough decisions  even when they're not politically convenient  and most importantly  you know that i'll fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  and that's why i know what real change looks like  because i've fought for it  i've got the scars to prove it   i laughter i  i've got gray hair to show for it   i laughter i  you fought for it too  and after all that we've been through together  we sure as heck can't give up now  let's picture what real change looks like  real change is a country where americans of every age have the skills and education that good jobs require  and you know what  we understand government can't do this alone  parents have to parent  teachers have to teach  but don't tell me that hiring more teachers won't help this economy or help young people compete  don't tell me that students who can't afford college should just borrow money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me  i'll bet it was not an option for a whole lot of you  we shouldn't be ending college tax credits to pay for millionaires' tax cuts  we should be making college more affordable for everybody who's willing to work for it  we should recruit   math and science teachers so that high tech  high wage jobs aren't created in china  but are created right here in colorado  we should work with our community colleges to train another   million americans with the skills that businesses are looking for right now  and that's all part of my plan for the future  that's what change is  that's the america that we're fighting for  that's what's at stake in this election  change comes when we live up to america's legacy of innovation  where we make america home to the next generation of advanced manufacturing and scientific discovery and technological breakthroughs  i'm proud that i bet on america's workers and american ingenuity and the american auto industry  and today  we're not just building cars again  we're building better cars  cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  today  there are thousands of workers building long lasting batteries and solar technology and wind turbines all across the country  jobs that weren't there   years ago  and not every technology we bet on will pan out  not every business will thrive  but i promise you this  there is a brilliant future for manufacturing in america  there is a future for clean energy in america  and i'm not going to cede that future to other countries  i don't want a tax code that rewards companies for creating those jobs overseas  i want to reward companies that create those jobs here in america  i don't want a tax code that subsidizes oil company profits when they're making money hand over fist  i want to support the energy jobs of tomorrow and the new technology that will cut our oil imports in half  that will reduce the carbon in our atmosphere  that will make us less dependent on foreign oil  that's my plan for growth and jobs  that's the future i see in america  that's worth fighting for   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  change real change is finally turning the page on a decade of war  let's do some nation building right here at home  so long as i'm commander in chief  we will pursue our enemies with the strongest military the world's ever known  that will not change  but it's time to use some of the savings from ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan to start paying down our debt  to start rebuilding america  that's part of being strong  that's part of our national security  right now we can put people back to work all across colorado  all across the country  fixing roads and bridges  expanding broadband to rural neighborhoods  making sure our schools are state of the art  let's put americans back to work doing the work that needs to be done  and let's especially focus on our veterans  because nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  that's my commitment to you  that's part of keeping america strong  that's what's at stake in this election  change is a future where we reduce our deficit in a way that's balanced and responsible  and i've signed a trillion dollars' worth of spending cuts  i intend to do more  we can streamline agencies  we can get rid of programs that aren't working  but if we're serious about the deficit  we also have to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the tax rates they paid when bill clinton was in office  because a budget is all about priorities  it's about what values do we care about  and as long as i'm president  i'm not going to turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i'm not going to allow this nation to be plunged into another battle over health care reform and kick millions of people off of health care and weaken all the reforms that we put in place  including making sure that young people can stay on their parent's plan till they're   year old  just so insurance companies can jump back into the driver's seat  and by the way  i'm not going to allow politicians in washington to control health care choices that women should make for themselves  we're not going to do that  we're not going backwards  we're going forward  so  colorado  we know what change is  we know what the future requires  we don't need a big government agenda or a small government agenda  we need a middle class agenda that rewards the values of hard work and responsibility  we don't need a partisan agenda  we need a commonsense agenda that says when we educate a poor child  we're all better off  that says when we fund the research of a young scientist  her new discovery will benefit every american  we need an agenda that recognizes we don't just look out for ourselves  we look out for one another other  we look out for future generations  we meet those obligations by working together  that's the change we believe in  that's what   was about  that's what this election's about  that's why i need you to vote  now  let me be clear  achieving this agenda will not be easy  it wasn't easy over these last   years  it's not going to be easy the next   years  back in   when we talked about change  i told you i wasn't just talking about changing presidents  i wasn't just talking about changing parties  i was talking about changing our politics  i ran because the voices of the american people your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long  by lobbyists and special interests and politicians who think compromise is a dirty word and would say anything to win office and do anything to stay in office  and as we expected  the protectors of the status quo are a powerful force in washington  and over the last   years  every time we've fought to make change  they fought back with everything they've got  they spent millions to stop us from reforming health care and wall street and student loans  their strategy from the start was to engineer pure gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise on ideas that traditionally both democrats and republicans have supported  and what they're now counting on is that the american people will be so worn down by all the squabbling  so tired of all the dysfunction  that you actually reward obstruction  either by voting for folks claiming to bring about change or not voting at all  but either way  putting people back in charge who advocate the very same policies that got us into this mess  in other words  their bet is on cynicism  they're counting on you not voting  that's their entire strategy  but  colorado  my bet is on you   i applause i  my bet's on you  my bet's on the decency and good sense of the american people  because despite all the resistance  despite all the setbacks  we've gotten done so much  and we've never lost sight of the vision that we share  that you would have a voice  that there would be somebody at the table fighting every single day for middle class americans  for folks who are working hard and struggling  sometimes republicans in congress worked with me to meet our goals  to cut taxes for small businesses and families like yours  to open up new markets for american goods  to finally repeal  don't ask  don't tell  we had a couple of really brave republicans who worked with us on that  and sometimes we've had big fights  like when we forced the banks to stop overcharging for student loans  which is how we made college more affordable for millions of young people  like when we forced wall street to abide by the toughest rules since the  s  like when we stopped insurance companies from discriminating against americans with preexisting conditions like cancer or diabetes so no one in america goes bankrupt just because they get sick  i didn't fight those fights for any partisan advantage  i have shown my willingness to work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  and if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders whether they're democrats  republicans  or independents who feel the same way  you'll vote for candidates like shelley you'll vote for candidates like michael bennet and mark udall and jared polis  all who have shown themselves to be willing to work across party lines to get things done  but who also know that there's some core principles you don't compromise  because if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals that will kick students off financial aid or get rid of funding for planned parenthood or eliminate health care for millions on medicaid just to give millionaires a tax cut  then that's not a deal worth having  that's not bipartisanship  that's not change  that's surrender to the same status quo that has hurt middle class families for way too long  and  colorado  i'm not ready to give up on the fight   i applause i  i'm not ready to give up on that fight  and i hope you aren't either  colorado  i hope you aren't either  i hope you've still got some fight left in you  the folks at the very top in this country  they don't need another champion in washington  they'll always have a seat at the table  they'll always have access and influence  they can hire lobbyists  they're going to be able to get their phone calls returned  the people who need a champion are those americans whose letters i read late at night  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every single day  the laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of   for a new career in biotechnology  she needs a champion  the small restaurant owner who needs a loan to expand after the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and waiters and cleaning staff working overtime in a hotel somewhere  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who never thought he'd work in a plant again and now is back on the job building a great car and full of pride and dignity  he needs a champion  the young teacher doing her best in an overcrowded classroom with outdated textbooks  she needs a champion  all those kids in inner cities and small farm towns  in valleys of ohio  rolling virginia hills  right here in boulder  kids who are dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors or engineers or entrepreneurs or diplomats or even a president  they need a champion in washington  they need a champion  because the future doesn't have lobbyists  it'll never have as many lobbyists as the vested interests  never have as many lobbyists as the past does  but it's the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace  and that's why i need you  colorado  that's why i need you  boulder  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we've come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to grow fainthearted  now is the time to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids  to train all our workers  to create new jobs  to discover new energy  to broaden opportunity  to grow our middle class  to restore our democracy  to make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from  how you started out  you can make it here in america if you try  in the middle of the great depression  fdr reminded the country that  failure is not an american habit  and in the strength of great hope we must shoulder our common load  that's the strength we need today  that's the hope i'm asking you to share  that's the future in our sights  that's why i'm asking for your vote  that's why i need you early voting tomorrow  that's why i need young people to turn out  that's why i need you to knock on some more doors  that's why i need you to make some phone calls  and if you turn out for me  if you vote for me  we'll win colorado again  we'll win this election  we'll finish what we started  we'll keep moving forward  we'll renew those bonds and reaffirm that spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america  remember to vote "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  ohio  o h   i audience members i  i o   i the president i  o h   i audience members i  i o   i the president i

done  give it up for your former governor  our great friend  ted strickland  poor ted's got a cold  he's backstage  he was he wouldn't shake my hand   i laughter i  he's sick  but he's still out campaigning  tireless   i audience member i  we love you  barack   i the president i  i love you back  and i'm glad to be here   i audience member i  obama is i inaudible i   i audience member i  settle down so we can see   i the president i  i can tell this is kind of a rowdy crowd  huh   i laughter i  all right  all right   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i   i laughter i  thank you  well  listen  for the past few days  all of us have been focused on one of the worst storms in our lifetimes  in our history  and i just got off the phone with my team  emergency management team  and got an update on what's happening in new jersey and new york and connecticut  west virginia  where there's a whole lot of snow  as a nation  we mourn those who were lost  you can only imagine what so many families are going through right now  and the message i've sent every time i talk to people back east is we stand with the people of new york and new jersey and connecticut every step of the way in the hard weeks ahead  and there's a lot of work that still remains to be done  but we've also been inspired these last few days by the heroes who were running into buildings and wading through water and the neighbors who were helping neighbors cope with tragedy  the leaders of different parties working together to fix what's broken  a spirit that says no matter how bad the storm is  no matter how tough times are  we're all in this together  we rise or fall as one nation and as one people  and that spirit is what's guided this country for more than two centuries  that idea that we're in this together  it's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last  something years  but also the last   years  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  and today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  and this morning  we learned that companies hired more workers in october than at any time in the last   months  the american auto industry is back on top  home values and housing construction is on the rise  we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in   years  because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is ending  al qaida has been decimated  usama bin laden is dead  we have made real progress   i audience member i  good job  man   i laughter i   i the president i   i laughter i  this guy had a lot of coffee this morning  you're fired up  okay  so listen  hold on a second  we've made real progress  but we are here today because we know we've got more work to do  as long as there's a single american who wants a job and can't find one  as long as there are families working harder  but falling behind  as long as there's a child anywhere in this country who's languishing in poverty and barred from opportunity  our fight goes on  we've got more work to do  our fight goes on because this nation can't succeed without a growing  thriving middle class  our fight goes on because america always has done best when everybody has a fair shot  and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why you elected me in   and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  ohio  in   days  you have a choice to make  and by the way  i think you may have noticed that everybody is paying a lot of attention to ohio  and rightfully so  the this is a choice not just between two candidates or two parties  it's a choice between two fundamentally different visions of america  it's a choice between going back to the top down policies that crashed our economy or adapting the kinds of policies that will make sure we've got a strong and growing middle class  that's the choice  as americans  we honor the strivers and the dreamers and the risk takers  the entrepreneurs  the small business people  they're the folks who have always been the driving force behind our free enterprise system  and it's been the greatest engine of growth and prosperity the world has ever known  but we also believe in this country that people succeed  people start businesses  people work well in businesses when they've got a decent education  when they get a chance to learn new skills  when we support research into medical breakthroughs or new technologies  we think america is stronger when we can count on affordable health care and medicare and social security  when there are rules to protect our kids from toxic dumping and mercury pollution  we think the market works better when consumers are protected from unscrupulous practices in the credit card industry or from mortgage lenders  and we believe that no politician in washington should control health care choices that women can make for themselves  these are the things we believe  now  for   years  we had a president who shared our beliefs  and his name was bill clinton  his economic plan asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little more so we could reduce our deficit and invest in the skills and ideas of our people  and at the time the republican congress and a senate candidate by the name of mitt romney said that bill clinton's plan would hurt the economy and kill jobs  it turns out the governor's math was just as bad back then as it was today  because by the end of president clinton's second term  america had created   million new jobs  and incomes were up  and poverty was down  and we had the biggest surplus in our history instead of deficits  so we know the ideas that we believe in work  we know that their ideas don't work  for most of the last decade  we tried what they want to do  giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans that we couldn't afford  we tried giving insurance companies and oil companies and wall street free rein to do whatever they pleased  and you know what we got  falling incomes  record deficits  the slowest job growth in half a century  and an economic crisis that we've been cleaning up after for the last   years  so we know what we want to do works  we know what they want to do doesn't work  we know what we want to do grows our middle class  what they want to do squeezes the middle class  we know that our strategy makes sure that we bring our deficit down in a balanced way  their strategy ends up shooting the deficit up  so we know what the right choice is  but let's face it  governor romney  he's a very talented salesman  in this campaign he's tried as hard as he can to repackage these same policies and offer them up as change  but we know what change looks like  and what the governor is offering ain't it  giving more power back to the biggest banks  that's not change  another   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy  that's not change  refusing to answer questions about the details of your policies until after the election  that's not change  we've seen that before   i laughter i  right  we've seen that before  ruling out compromise by pledging to rubber stamp the tea party's agenda in congress  that's not change  and by the way  when you try to change the facts just because they're inconvenient to your campaign  that's definitely not change  trying to massage the facts  that's not change  that's just i laughter i  look  we've been seeing this out of governor romney and his friends over the last few weeks right here in ohio  you've got folks who work at the jeep plant who have been calling their employers worried  asking is it true  are our jobs being shipped to china  and the reason they're making these calls is because governor romney has been running an ad that says so  except it's not true  everybody knows it's not true  the car companies themselves have told governor romney to knock it off  gm said  we think creating jobs in the united states should be a source of bipartisan pride  and i couldn't agree more  and i understand that governor romney has had a tough time here in ohio because he was against saving the auto industry  and it's hard to run away from that position when you're on videotape saying the words   let detroit go bankrupt  and i know we're close to an election  but this isn't a game  these are people's jobs  these are people's lives  these car companies are putting a lot of effort to make great products  but also to make sure that everybody in america knows how committed they are to making cars here in america  and so you don't scare hard working americans just to scare up some votes  that's not what being president is all about  that's not leadership  when i first made the decision to rescue the auto industry  i knew it wasn't popular  and despite the fact that one out of eight jobs in ohio are connected to the auto industry in some way  it wasn't even popular in ohio  but i knew it was the right thing to do  i knew betting on american workers was the right thing to do  betting on american ingenuity and know how was the right thing to do  that paid off  it paid off in lordstown  where gm is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in their auto plant  it paid off in toledo  where chrysler is adding more than a thousand new jobs on a second shift  not in china  right here in ohio  right here in united states of america  and so one of the things i hope when you're talking to your friends and your neighbors  they're trying to make up their minds these last few days  think about that  think about the issue of trust  think about do you want a president who is going to actually tell you what he believes and what he thinks or somebody who is going to   i audience members i  lie   i the president i  no  who's going to well  change the facts  after   years as president  you know me  you may not agree with every decision i've made  you may be frustrated sometimes at the pace of change  but you know what i believe  you know where i stand  you know i tell the truth  and you know that i'll fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  you know that  and you know that i know what real change looks like  because i've fought for real change  and you've helped me every step of the way  after all we've been through together  we can't give up on real change now  change is a country where americans of every age have the skills and education that are needed for getting a good job  and let me tell you  when i hear folks saying hiring more teachers won't help this economy grow  they are wrong  because if we've got great teachers in the classroom  that's going to help our kids  and it's going to help our economy  don't tell me that students who can't afford college should just borrow more money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me  it wasn't an option for a lot of you  that's why i want to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next   years  i want to recruit   math and science teachers so that our kids don't fall behind the rest of the world  i want to train   million americans at our community colleges with skills that businesses are looking for right now  that's what we're fighting for in this election  that's what real change is   i audience member i  i've got your back   i the president i  thank you  change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation  today  the great news about the auto industry is we're not just building cars again  we're building better cars  innovative cars  cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  and by the way  here in ohio  it's not just cars that we're starting to manufacture again  we're building long lasting batteries and wind turbines all across ohio  all across the country  we've got to keep our cutting edge technology and research and innovation and investment  and i don't want a tax code that subsidizes oil company profits when they're making money hand over fist  i want to support the energy jobs of tomorrow  the new technologies that will help cut our oil imports in half  and i don't want a tax code that rewards companies for creating those jobs overseas  i want to reward companies that are creating jobs in manufacturing right here in the united states of america  that's my plan  that's what real change is  change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home  as long as i'm commander in chief  we will pursue our enemies with the strongest military that the world's ever known  but it's time to use the savings from ending the wars in iraq and winding down the war in afghanistan to pay down our debt and rebuild america  repairing roads and bridges and schools all across ohio  all across america  and let's especially focus on putting our veterans back to work as they come home  we need to serve them as well as they've served us  nobody who fights for this country should have to fight for a job when they come home  that's what's at stake in this election  that's my commitment  change is a future where we do reduce our deficit  but we do it in a balanced  responsible way  i've already signed a trillion dollars' worth of spending cuts  i intend to do more  but if we're serious about the deficit  we also have to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the rates that they paid when bill clinton was in office  because if i'm not paying a little bit more  and governor romney is not paying a little bit more  then the choice is to start cutting out help for young people trying to go to school  it's to hurt folks who are vulnerable and depend on things like medicaid  as long as i'm president  i will never turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i'm not going to make it more expensive for some young person who is working hard trying to go to school  i'm not going to make them pay more just so i get a tax break that i don't need  i'm not going to cut out some research grant to some outstanding young scientist that could have the next discovery for cancer just because i want a tax cut that i don't need  that's not who we are  that's not what change is  we know what the future requires  and we know it won't be easy  back in   i told some of you  i said  look  i'm not just talking about changing presidents or changing political parties in washington  i said to if we're going to talk about real change  we're talking about changing how our politics works  i ran because the voices of the american people your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long  by lobbyists and special interests  politicians who will do whatever it takes to keep things just the way they are  and over the last   years  you've seen it  the status quo in washington has fought us every step of the way  they've spent millions trying to stop us from reforming the health care system  they've spent millions trying to keep us from reforming wall street  they engineered a strategy of gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise on ideas that both democrats and republicans in the past have supported  what they're counting on now is that you're going to be so worn down by all the squabbling  so worn down by all the dysfunction that you'll just give up  walk away  put them back into power   i audience members i  no   i the president i  in other words  ohio  their bet is on cynicism  my bet is on you  my fight is for you  when the other party has been with me in that fight  i've worked with them  look  there have been times when republicans cooperated on tax cuts for middle class families and small businesses  they were republicans who helped us repeal  don't ask  don't tell  when they're about broadening opportunity and helping the middle class  we can work together  but as long as i'm president  i've said i will work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders who feel the same way whether they're democrat  republican  or independents  but i'm not just going to cut a deal that kicks students off of financial aid or gets rid of funding for planned parenthood or let's insurance companies discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or eliminate health care for millions on medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled  if that's the price of peace  then i'm not going to pay that price  that's not bipartisanship  that's not change  that's surrender to the same status quo that has hurt the middle class and all those families who are trying to get into the middle class for way too long  and  ohio  i'm not ready to give up on the fight  i'm not ready to give up on the fight to make sure that the middle class is growing  i'm not ready to give up on the fight to make sure every child has opportunity  i hope you aren't either  ohio   i applause i  i hope you aren't either  the folks at the very top in this country  they don't need another champion in washington  they already have a seat at the table  they'll always have access and influence  the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day  the laid off worker who has gone back to a community college to retrain for the jobs of the future  she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who needs a loan to expand after the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and the waiters and the cleaning staff at a hotel  trying to buy a first home or send their kid to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who had lost his job  wasn't sure the plant would ever reopen  and now is back in that plant building a car and feeling the dignity and pride of doing a great job  he needs a champion  those kids in inner cities and small farm towns and the valleys of ohio  rolling virginia hills  right here in hilliard  kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors or engineers or entrepreneurs and diplomats or even a president  they need a champion in washington  the future will never have as many lobbyists as the past does  as the status quo does  as the vested interests do  but it's the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace  it's the dreams of those children that move us forward  that's what we have to champion  that's why i need you  ohio  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we've come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to grow fainthearted  it's time to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids and train all our workers  create new jobs  rebuild our infrastructure  discover new sources of energy  broaden opportunity  grow our middle class  restore our democracy to make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from  you can make it in america  that's what we're fighting for  ohio  i'm asking for your vote  and if you're willing to work with me again and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls for me and turn out for me  grab your friends and neighbors and coworkers  we'll win ohio  we'll win this election  we'll reaffirm the bonds that tie us together  we'll reaffirm the spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  thank you  everybody  god bless you  god bless america  hey "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  ohio  thank you  how's it going  wildcats  there really are some wildcats in here  you're fired up  are you fired up  are you fired up  fired up  can everybody please give alicia a big round of applause for the great introduction  it is great to see all of you  for the past few days   i audience member i  i love you   i the president i  i love you back  i do   i applause i  i do  for the past few days  all of us have been focused on one of the worst storms in our lifetime  and everybody in ohio obviously has been watching the images on tv  we are so saddened by those who lost their lives  we can only imagine what their families are going through  and our thoughts and prayers are with them  i had a call this morning with my emergency teams  and one of the things that i've emphasized to everybody on the east coast  people all around the country want to send a message  and that is  we will stand with folks in new york and new jersey and connecticut every step of the way until they have fully recovered  that's a commitment we're making to them  when i make those commitments  i don't make those commitments just as president  i make those commitments on behalf of the american people  and what's interesting is  during these kinds of crises  these disasters  as tough as it is and as sad as it is  we're also inspired  because we see heroes running into buildings and wading through water to save their fellow citizens  we see neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy  we see leaders of different political parties working to fix what's broken  not to score political points  we see a spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is  no matter how tough times are  we're going to make it because we're all in this together  we rise or fall as one nation and as one people  and that spirit  ohio  has guided this country along its improbable journey for more than two centuries  and it's also guided us and carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last   years  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  and this morning we learned that companies hired more workers in october than at any

service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is ending  al qaida has been decimated  usama bin laden is dead  so we're on the move  ohio  we've made real progress these past   years  but the reason all of you are here today the reason i'm here today is because we know we've got more work to do  as long as there's a single american who wants a job  but can't find one  our work is not done  as long as there are families working harder  but falling behind  as long as there's a child anywhere in this country who is languishing in poverty  barred from opportunity  our fight goes on  we are not finished yet  we've got more work to do  we're here because we understand this nation cannot succeed without a growing  thriving middle class  without sturdy ladders for folks who are willing hard to get into the middle class  our fight goes on because america has always done best when everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's what you believe  that's why you elected me in   and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  in   days  springfield    days just   days for   years  in   days  you've got a choice to make  it's not just a choice between two parties or two candidates  it's a choice between two different visions for america  it's a choice between going back to the top down policies that got us into this mess or the middle out  bottom up strategies that have gotten us out of this mess and are going to keep us going  as americans  we believe in free enterprise  and we believe in the strivers and the dreamers and the risk takers who are the driving force behind our economy  that's how we create growth and prosperity  the greatest the world has ever known  but we also believe that our economy does better  our businesses do better  our entrepreneurs do better  when everybody has got a chance to succeed  when all our children are getting a decent education  when all our workers are learning new skills  when we support research in medical breakthroughs and new technologies  we believe america is stronger when everybody can count on affordable health insurance and medicare and social security  when our kids are protected from toxic dumping and pollution  when our consumers aren't being taken advantage of by credit card companies or mortgage lenders  we believe in a democracy where everybody's voice is heard  where you just can't buy an election  and we believe in politicians who understand that there's some things the american people can do better for themselves  for example  that politicians in washington mostly men shouldn't be controlling health care choices that women can make perfectly well for themselves  for   years  we had a president who shared these beliefs a guy named bill clinton  and so our beliefs were put to the test  his economic plan asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more so we could continue to invest in our people  continue to invest in ideas and innovation  invest in our infrastructure  and at the time  the republican congress and a senate candidate by the name of mitt romney   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  no  no  no  don't boo  vote   i applause i  vote  voting is the best revenge  but at the time  mitt romney said bill clinton's plan would hurt the economy and kill jobs  it turns out  his math back then was just as bad as it is today  because by the end of president clinton's second term  america had created   million new jobs and incomes were up and poverty was down and our deficit became the biggest surplus in history  so our ideas were tried and tested  and they worked  their ideas were also tried  and they didn't work out so well  because remember  in the   years after bill clinton left office  they tried this top down economics  they tried this you're on your own economics  we tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans  we tried giving insurance companies and oil companies and big wall street banks a free license to do whatever they pleased  we tried it  and what did we get  we got falling incomes  record deficits  the slowest job growth in half a century  and we ended up with an economic crisis that we've been cleaning up after ever since  so we tried our ideas  they worked  we tried their ideas didn't work  now  governor romney  he's a very gifted salesman  so he's been trying in this campaign  as hard as he can  to repackage these ideas that didn't work the very same policies that did not work and he's trying to pretend that they're change  have you heard him  he's going around saying  i'm the candidate of change  except when you look at the policies  they're the same ones that didn't work  now  the thing is  we know what change looks like  and what he's selling ain't it  giving more power to the biggest banks  that's not change  another   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy is not change  refusing to answer questions about the details of your policies until after the election  not change  ruling out compromise  pledging to rubberstamp the tea party agenda in congress  that's not change  that's exactly what we need to change  kind of massaging the facts when they're inconvenient to your campaign  that's definitely not change  that's the oldest trick in the book  that's what governor romney has been doing these last few weeks  you've been seeing it  right here in ohio  folks who work at the jeep plant have been having to call up their employers because they're worried  they're asking if their jobs are being shipped to china  and the reason they're worried is because they saw ads run by governor romney saying jeep plants were going to be shipping jobs to china  of course  it turns out  it's not true  the car companies themselves have told governor romney to knock it off   i applause i  knock it off  that's what they said  gm general motors said  we think creating jobs in the united states should be a source of bipartisan pride  that's what they said  and they're right  i couldn't agree more  and i understand governor romney has a tough time here in ohio because he was against saving the auto industry  and the auto industry accounts for one out of eight jobs here in ohio  so i get that it's a problem for him  but you can't run away  days    days    days before an election run away from that position  especially when you're on videotape saying the words   let detroit go bankrupt  you said it  and you can't try to scare people  listen  this is not a game  these are people's jobs  these are people's lives  the auto industry  they spend a lot of money advertising and branding and letting folks know that we're back and we're here in america and we're making american cars with american workers  and now  suddenly  you've got a guy going out there saying something that's not true  you don't scare hardworking americans just to scare up some votes  that's not what being president is about  when i first made the decision to rescue the auto industry  some of you don't remember this  but it was not very popular  even in ohio and michigan  it wasn't popular  but i knew it was the right thing to do  betting on american workers was the right thing to do  betting on american ingenuity and know how and manufacturing  that was the right thing to do  and that bet paid off  and it paid off in lordstown  and it paid off in toledo  they're creating new jobs right now  not in china  right here in ohio  right here in the united states of america  it was the right thing to do  and so  as you think about the choice over these next   days  and when you're talking to your friends and your neighbors and your colleagues  one of the things that's important about electing a president is trust trust  is somebody going to say what they mean and mean what they say  after   years as president  you know me  you may not agree with every decision i've made  sometimes you may have been frustrated at the pace of change  but you know what i believe  you know where i stand  you know i tell the truth  you know i'll fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  that's why i'm running for a second term  because i want to fight for you  that's why i need your votes  springfield  that's why i need your vote  ohio  and i know what real change looks like  because i fought for it  right alongside you  and after all we've been through together  we sure can't give up now  let me tell you about the change we need over the next   years  real change  real change is a country where every american has a shot at a great education  this school that we're in is an example of a school that's making incredible reforms  the race to the top program that we put together  this is one of the winners of race to the top  right this school right here  so we know how to raise standards and recruit great teachers and become more creative in the classroom  and our kids are going to succeed  but you can't tell me that more teachers won't help grow our economy  don't tell me that students who can't afford to college to go to college should just borrow more money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me  probably wasn't an option for a lot of you  that's why i want to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next   years  that's why i want to recruit   math and science teachers so our kids don't fall behind the rest of the world  that's why i want to train   million americans at our community colleges with the skills that businesses are looking for right now  that's what change is  that's my plan for the future  that's the america we're fighting for in this election  forward  change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation  the nice thing about the auto industry  we're not just building cars again  we're building better cars again  more advanced cars  better technology  cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  today  there are workers who are building long lasting batteries and wind turbines all across the country and right here in ohio  these are jobs that didn't exist   years ago  and i don't want a tax code that subsidizes oil company profits when oil companies are already making a lot of money  i want to support the clean energy jobs of tomorrow  i want to support the new technology that is going to cut our oil imports in half by   i don't want a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to reward companies that are taking root right here in springfield  ohio  right here a i pplause i right here in lordstown  in toledo  in youngstown  i am confident about a renaissance  a resurgence of american manufacturing  and that's good for the entire economy  that's the future i see for this country  making stuff again  selling it all around the world  products stamped with three proud words  made in america  change real change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home  as long as i'm commander in chief  we'll pursue our enemies with the strongest military the world's ever known  but it's time we used some of the savings from ending the war to pay down our debt  rebuild america  put folks back to work right now repairing roads and bridges  schools all across this country  and let's put our veterans back to work  because anybody who's served us  protected us  fought for our freedom should not have to fight for a job when they come home  that should be our priority  that's my plan to keep us strong  that's my commitment to them  that's what's at stake in this election  you want to talk about real change  let's talk about how we reduce our deficit in a balanced and responsible way  i signed a trillion dollars' worth of spending cuts  i'm ready to do more  i will work with democrats and republicans  but if we're serious about reducing the deficit  we've also got to ask folks like me  the wealthiest americans in the country  to go back to paying taxes at the same rate when bill clinton was in office  millionaires and billionaires  they're not going to be going to the poorhouse because they paid a slightly higher tax rate  they'll be fine  and if we're going to be serious about reducing the deficit you've got to make choices  you can't just reduce the deficit on the backs of the middle class  on the backs of the poor  as long as i'm president  i'm not going to turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i'm not going to make it more expensive for young people to go to college just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i'm not going to eliminate investments in research and science that are the key to our future just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut  that's not who we are  those aren't the right priorities  that's not real change  we know what real change is  we know what the future requires  and we also know it's not going to be easy  i talked about this in   some people forgot  but in   i said back then  when i talk about change that we can believe in  i'm not just talking about changing presidents or changing parties  i'm talking about changing our politics  i ran the last time and i'm running this time  because the voices of the american people your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long  by lobbyists and special interests and politicians who will do whatever it takes to just keep things the way they are  the protectors of the status quo  and over the last   years  the status quo in washington  they fought us every step of the way on everything we wanted to do  they spent millions of dollars trying to stop us from reforming health care  millions of dollars trying to stop us from reforming wall street  they engineered a strategy of gridlock in washington  refusing to compromise on anything  even on ideas that both democrats and republicans had supported in the past  and what they're counting on now is that you're going to be so fed up  so worn down with all the squabbling in washington  so tired of all the dysfunction  that you'll just give up  just walk away  and leave them to make the decisions  they're betting on cynicism  ohio  i'm betting on you  i'm betting on you  i'm betting on the decency and good sense of the american people  the folks i meet all across ohio and all across this country  and that doesn't mean that this is just a democratic thing  when the other party has been with me to help middle class families  i loved working with them  we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses  some of them cooperated  when we came together to repeal  don't ask  don't tell  there were some courageous republican senators who stood up  i appreciate that  i will work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  and if you really want to break the gridlock in congress  then you'd better vote for leaders who feel the same way  whether they are democrats or republicans or independents  you'd better work for folks who are putting people first  not the next election first  but i want everybody to be clear  there are still going to be some struggles and some fights  look  i'm a very nice guy  people will tell you   i laughter i  i really am  but if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals that kicks students off of financial aid or getting rid of funding for planned parenthood or let insurance companies discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or eliminate health care for millions of folks on medicaid who are elderly or disabled or poor  i'm not going to make that deal  i'll fight against that deal  that's a price i'm not willing to pay  that's not bipartisanship  that's not change  that's surrender to a status quo that has hurt too many american families  and i'm not going along with it   i applause i  i'm not going along with it  i am a long ways away from giving up on this fight  i got a lot of fight left in me   i audience member i  you're not too tired   i the president i  i don't get tired  i don't grow weary  i hope you aren't tired either  ohio   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i hope you aren't tired either  the folks at the very top in this country  they don't need another champion in washington  they've got lobbyists  they've got pacs  they've always got a seat at the table  they'll always have access  they'll always have influence in congress  the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read every night  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day  the laid off furniture worker who decides to go back to a community college and retrain at the age of   she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who needs a loan to expand after the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and the waiters and the cleaning staff working overtime in some vegas hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kids to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who was laid off and never thought he'd go back to the line again and then suddenly was called back in and is now building a great car  filling him with pride and dignity  he needs a champion  all those kids in inner cities and small farm towns and the rolling virginia hills or the valleys of ohio  right here in springfield kids dreaming of becoming doctors and scientists  engineers and entrepreneurs and diplomats and maybe even a president they need a champion in washington  because they're our future  and the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo  but those children are our saving grace  that's what we're fighting for  that's what we're fighting for  and that's why i need you  ohio  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we've come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to grow fainthearted  now is the time to keep pushing  now is the time to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids and train all our workers and to create new jobs and rebuild our infrastructure  discover new sources of energy  broaden opportunity  grow our middle class  restore our democracy  and make sure that no matter what you look like or where you come from or how you started out  you can make it in america if you try  that's what we're fighting for  that's why i need your vote  and if you're willing to work with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls with me and turn out with me  we'll win ohio  we'll win this election  we'll renew those bonds that tie us together as a people  we'll reaffirm that spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless america "], ["obama2", "hello  wildcats  how's everybody doing today  you doing good  well  listen  i'm not going to give a long speech here  i just wanted to come by and say it's great to see all of you  and as i'm looking around  there are a lot of you who are too young to vote  but you're not too young to make sure your parents vote  you're not too young to tell your uncles and aunties and grandpas and grandmas to vote  because this is a big election  and if we win ohio  we're going to win this election  so i just want to say thank you to all of you  and i'm going to come shake some hands  all right  it's great to see you guys  thank you "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  iowa  it is good to be back in dubuque  it is good to be back close to home  i was just talking backstage  you get close to the midwest  and suddenly  everybody is just nice   i laughter i  feels good  can everybody please give sandy a big round of applause for the great introduction  and give sandy's son a big round of applause for serving our country  give it up for john mellencamp  it is wonderful to be here  for the last several days  all of us have been focused on one of the worst storms in our lifetime  what's been happening on the east coast  and i know i speak for the country when i say our thoughts and prayers are with those who've lost loved ones  people whose lives have been upended  folks here in iowa know something about flooding  you remember what happened just a few years ago  and the recovery process is tough  but when i visited new jersey  i told folks there that everybody all across the country feels the same way  we are going to be with people every step of the way  down the long  hard road of recovery  we're going to help them rebuild  we're going to do it together  that's what americans do  in fact  in the middle of the tragedy  we were also inspired by heroes running into buildings  wading through water  our first responders  our firefighters  ems teams  neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy  leaders of different parties working together to fix what's broken  a spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is  no matter how tough times may get  we always bounce back  we're all in this together  we rise or fall as one nation  that's what we believe  and that spirit has guided this country along its improbable journey for two centuries now  and it's carried us through the last   years  remember  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  the american auto industry is back on top  home values are on the rise  we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last   years  because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is winding down  al qaida is on the run  usama bin laden is dead  so we have made real progress  iowa  these past   years  but we're here this evening because we know we've got more work to do  as long as there's a single american who wants a job and can't find one  our job is not done  as long as there are families working harder  but falling behind  we've got more work to do  as long as there's a child anywhere in iowa  anywhere this country  who's languishing in poverty or barred from opportunity  our fight goes on  our fight goes on because we know this country cannot succeed without a growing  thriving middle class and strong  sturdy ladders for everybody who's willing to work hard to get into the middle class  our fight goes on because america has always done best when everybody has a fair shot  everybody is doing their fair share  everybody is playing by the same rules  that's what we believed in   that's what we believe today  and that is why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  in iowa  in   days  you have a choice to make  and some of you have made it  because we have early vote in iowa  but if but for those of you who have not  it's not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  it's a choice between two different visions of america  it's a choice between going back to the top down economics that crashed our economy or embracing a future where we're building a strong and growing middle class  as americans  we honor the strivers and the dreamers  the small business men and women  the entrepreneurs  the risk takers  the free enterprise system that's the greatest engine of prosperity the world has ever known  but we also know that our markets work best  the free enterprise system works best when everybody is participating  when we make sure that everybody has got a good education and everybody can learn new skills  when we support research into medical breakthroughs or clean energy technology  we think that america is stronger when everybody can count on affordable health care and medicare and social security in their retirement  we think the markets work better when there are rules in place to protect our kids from toxic dumping  to protect consumers from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous credit card companies or mortgage lenders  we don't want government doing everything  we think that we can do most things ourselves  but there are times where we can come together  and we certainly don't want government getting involved in the wrong things  for example  we think we don't need politicians especially  mostly male politicians to try to control health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making themselves  now  for   years  we had a president who shared these beliefs  his name was bill clinton  his economic plan  like mine  asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more so we could reduce our deficit  invest in the skills of our people  invest in the ideas we needed to succeed in a new economy  and at the time  back in the ' s  the republican congress and a senate candidate by the name of mitt romney said bill clinton's plan would hurt the economy and kill jobs  sound familiar  turns out  his math back then was just as bad as it is now  because by the end of president clinton's second term  we'd created   million new jobs  incomes were up  poverty was down  our deficit became the biggest surplus in history  so  iowa  we know our ideas work  we've put them to the test  we also know that their ideas don't work  because they've been tested also  in the   years before i came into office  we tried what they're selling  we tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans  we tried giving insurance companies and oil companies and wall street the free license to do whatever they pleased  here's what we got  falling incomes  record deficits  slowest growth in jobs in half a century  and an economic crisis we're still cleaning up after  so we know what works  we know what doesn't  now  governor romney  he's a very talented salesman  and in this campaign  he's been working overtime to try to repackage the old bad ideas that didn't work and try to sell them to you as new ideas  he's trying to say that they're change  but here's the thing  iowa  we know what change looks like  and what he's selling is not change  giving more power to the biggest banks  that's not change  another   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy  not change  audience members  no   i the president i  refusing to answer questions about the details of your policies until after the election  that's definitely not change  politicians do that all the time  ruling out compromise  pledging to rubberstamp the tea party agenda in congress  that's not change  that's what we need to change  that's why i'm running for a second term  changing the facts when they're inconvenient to your campaign  that is definitely not change  so what he's selling  we tried it  it didn't work  we're not going back  those are the attitudes in washington we need to change  and that raises something about the choice you have to make  iowa  a lot of choosing a president is about trust  iowa  i started my presidential journey right here in this state  so after   years of campaigning and after   years as president  you know me by now  you may not agree with every decision i've made  you may have sometimes been frustrated at the pace of change  but you know i laughter i you know that i say what i mean and i mean what i say  you know what i believe  you know where i stand  when i said i'd end the war in iraq  i ended the war in iraq  when i said i'd cut taxes for middle class families  i cut taxes for middle class families  when i said i'd pass health care reform so nobody goes broke when they get sick  i passed health care reform so nobody goes broke when they get sick  when i said we'd end  don't ask  don't tell  i ended  don't ask  don't tell  when i said i'd invest in clean energy  we've doubled clean energy production in this country  when i said we'd go after bin laden  we went after bin laden  you know i tell the truth  and you know i'll fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  that's what you know  so if this is a debate about real change  i know what change looks like  because i've fought for it and i've delivered it and i've got the scars to prove it  and you guys have stood with me  and after all we've been through together  we can't give up on it now  audience members  no   i the president i  so let me paint a vision of change for the next   years  this is going to be a country where every american has a shot at a good education  and government can't do it all  parents have to parent  teachers have to teach  but don't tell me more teachers won't help this economy grow  because i know that great teachers are what we need in america and what we need in iowa  don't tell me that students who can't afford college should just borrow more money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me  i'll bet it wasn't an option for a whole lot of you  that's why i want to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next   years  i want to recruit   math and science teachers so our kids don't fall behind the rest of the world  i want to train   million americans at our outstanding community colleges with the skills that businesses are hiring for right now  that's what real change is  that's what we're fighting for in this election  that's what's at stake  change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation  i could not be prouder that i bet on american workers and american ingenuity and on the american auto industry  and today  we're not just building cars again  we're building better cars  cars that in the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  and it's not just in the auto industry  there are thousands of workers right here in iowa building wind turbines  all across the country  building long lasting batteries  advanced manufacturing  i don't want a tax code that just subsidizes oil company profits when they're making money hand over fist  i want to support the energy jobs of future  the new technologies that will create new jobs and energy independence  cut our oil imports in half  i don't want to reward companies for creating jobs overseas  i want to reward companies that are investing right here in dubuque  right here in iowa  that's my plan for jobs  that's my plan for growth  that's the future i see for this country  change is turning a page on a decade of war so we can start doing some nation building here at home  as long as i'm commander in chief  we're going to pursue our enemies with everything we've got  with the strongest military the world has ever known  but it's time to use the savings from ending the wars in iraq and winding down the war in afghanistan to pay down our debt  rebuild america  we could put thousands of folks back to work right now  rebuilding our roads  our bridges  making sure our schools are state of the art  hiring our veterans  because if you fought for our country and defended our freedom  you shouldn't have to fight for a job when you come home  you shouldn't have to fight for the benefits you've earned when you come home  that's my commitment to veterans  but that's also my commitment to america  that's how we'll keep ourselves strong  that's what's at stake in this election  change is a future where we reduce our deficit in a balanced way  a responsible way  now  i've signed a trillion dollars' worth of cuts  taking out programs we don't need  and i want to do more  but if we're serious about reducing our deficit not just using it for a talking point during elections if we're serious about it  then we've also got to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the rate they paid under bill clinton  because budgets are about choices  and if we're going to cut back  let's make sure that we're not cutting back on things that are going to help us grow in the future  and let's make sure everybody is sharing in the sacrifice  i'm not going to turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i'm not going to sacrifice investments in basic research to pay for a tax cut for me and certainly not for mr  romney   i audience members i  no   i the president i  we don't need it  but america needs those investments to make sure we grow  so that's the change that we need  we know what change is  iowa  we know what the future requires  and we also know it's not going to be easy  back in  some of you remember  because i was campaigning here i said we need change we believe in  i wasn't just talking about changing presidents or changing parties  i was talking about changing how our politics work  i ran because the voices of the american people your voices had been shut out too long  by the lobbyists and special interests  the politicians who will do whatever it takes to keep things just the way they are  the protectors of the status quo  and over the last   years  the status quo in washington  they have fought us every step of the way  they tried to they spent millions of dollars trying to prevent us from reforming our health care system  millions of dollars trying to prevent us from ending taxpayer funded bailouts on wall street  millions of dollars trying to prevent us from protecting consumers  they engineered a strategy of gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise on ideas that in the past democrats and republicans had supported suddenly  republicans didn't support them anymore including  by the way  the health care bill that my opponent designed in massachusetts   i laughter i  and what they're counting on now is that you'll be so worn down by all the squabbling in washington  so tired of all the dysfunction   i audience member i  no way   i the president   i that you're just going to give up  walk away  and leave them in power   i audience members i  no   i the president i  they're betting on cynicism  but  iowa  my bet is on you  my bet is on the decency and the goodness and the resolve of the american people  and the fights we're fighting  they're not partisan  when the other party has been willing to work with me to help middle class families  to help folks have ladders of opportunity  like when we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses  and when we came together to repeal  don't ask  don't tell  i've embraced them  i want to work together  i believe we're all americans first  not democrats or republicans first  as long as i'm president  i will work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  and if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders who feel the same way whether they're democrats  republicans  or independents folks who put people first  not the next election first  but  iowa  look  i'm going to confess to you  there are times where we need to fight  if the price of peace in washington is just cutting deals that will kick students off of financial aid or get rid of funding for planned parenthood or let insurance companies discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or eliminate health care for millions on medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled  that price is too high  that's not a price i'm willing to pay  that's not bipartisanship  that's not real change  that's surrender to the same status quo that has hurt middle class families for way too long  and i don't know about you  but i'm not ready to give up on that fight  i may be full of gray hair now  but i'm just as determined as i was   years ago  i'm not tired  and i'm not weary  and  iowa  i hope you are not either  see  the folks at the very top in this country  they don't need a champion in washington  they'll always have a seat at the table  they'll always have access  they'll always have influence  that's the way things are  the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night after i'm done with my work in the office  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day  the folks i met that first summer when i was traveling around iowa and nobody could pronounce my name   i laughter i  the laid off furniture worker who suddenly has to retrain at the age of   for a new career  trying to figure out how to pay for community college  she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who's got some great food  but needs a loan to expand  and the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and the waiters and the cleaning staff at a hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kids to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who never thought he'd be back on the job  but then suddenly  things start picking up  and he got recalled  and now he's back on the line building a great car and full of pride and dignity because that job is not just about a paycheck  that's about knowing that you're contributing to something that's important  that you're helping the economy grow  that you're building your community  he needs a champion  all the firefighters and police officers and first responders who sacrifice so much to help their communities  they need a champion  and that teacher who's in an overcrowded classroom  outdated schoolbooks  having to dig into her own pocket to buy school supplies  sometimes just feeling discouraged  but then knowing that every day there might be just that one kid that she's touching that day  she needs a champion  all those kids in inner cities and small farm towns  the rolling hills of virginia  the valleys of ohio  right here in dubuque kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors or engineers or entrepreneurs  following the family tradition of farming the land  maybe becoming a diplomat  maybe becoming a president  starting a business they need champions in washington  because they don't have lobbyists  the future will never have as many lobbyists as the protectors of the status quo  but it's the dreams of those children that are our saving grace  they're the ones who will carry forward the vision of america that makes us so special  and that's why i need you  iowa  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we've come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our hearts grow weary  now is the time for us to keep pushing forward  to educating all our kids  to training all our workers  to creating new jobs  to rebuilding our infrastructure  to discovering new sources of energy  to broadening opportunity  to growing our middle class  to restoring our democracy  to making sure that in this country  it doesn't matter where you come from or how you started or what you look like or what your last name is  what race you are  what faith you are  it doesn't matter  you can make it if you try in america  that's why i'm asking for your vote  and if you're willing to work with me  if you're willing to keep on knocking on some doors with me  making some phone calls with me  turning out to vote for me  we'll win iowa  we'll win this election  we'll renew the bonds and reaffirm the spirit that makes the united states the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  ohio  hello  cardinals  the let me begin by just saying how grateful i am for kevin for that great introduction  but also how proud i am of erin and her sisters and their whole family  give them a big round of applause  there they are right there  now  the only thing i have to say is  is that erin she was pretty excited about meeting me  but she saw justin bieber the other day i laughter i so i'm  like  the second most exciting person she's met in the last few days   i laughter i  my understanding also is that this band right here just won the state championship  best band in ohio right here  in the house  congratulations  and the football team is in its first playoff game tonight  so the cardinals got a lot going on right now  and despite all that  the fact that you guys still came out i'm grateful for  so thank you  now  for the past several days  all of us have been focused on one of the worst hurricanes in our lifetimes  and each day  i've been getting on calls with mayors and governors  county officials  just trying to make sure that people are getting help  and i tell them that the entire country is behind them  we mourn those who were lost  we will walk with the people whose lives have been upended by the storm every step of the way in this long  hard road for recovery  and i hope everybody is out there i hope everybody understands this will be a not just a couple of weeks  but it's going to be months of recovery for a lot of these families  so those of you who can still help out through the red cross  please do so  and for the first responders who are here today  it's just a reminder of how important you are  because when you see our firefighters  our police officers  our ems folks out there every single day working  it's amazing  and so despite this tragedy  we've also been inspired by what we've seen over the last several days  over the last week  you see heroes running into buildings  wading into water to help their fellow citizens  neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy  leaders of different political parties working together to fix what's broken  it's a spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is  no matter how tough times are  we're all in this together  we rise or fall as one nation and as one people  and that spirit has guided this country along its improbable journey for more than two centuries  it's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last   years  remember  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  the auto industry is back on top  home values are on the rise  we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last   years  because of the service and the sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is winding down  al qaida is on the run  and usama bin laden is dead  so we've made real progress these past   years  but ohio  we're here today because we all know we've got more work to do   i audience member i  we love you  mr  president   i the president i  i love you back  and we've got more work to do  as long as there's a single american who wants a job and still can't find work  as long as there are families who are working harder and harder but are still falling behind  as long as there's a child anywhere in this country who's languishing in poverty or barred from opportunity  we've got more work to do  our fight goes on  our fight goes on because we know that we know this country can't thrive  can't succeed without a growing  strong middle class  our fight goes on because america is always at its best when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody's doing their fair share and everybody's playing by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why you elected me in   and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  in   days  you have a choice to make  although here in ohio  there's early vote  so you could make it right after you leave here  it's not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  it's a choice about two different visions for america  it's a choice between going back to the top down policies that crashed our economy  or a future that's built on a strong and growing middle class  when you think about the history of our economy  we've always honored the entrepreneurs and the small businessmen  the strivers  the dreamers  the risk takers  they're the driving force behind our free enterprise system  and that's the greatest engine of growth and prosperity the world's ever known  but we also believe that in this country  our businesses do well  markets do well when everybody is given a shot  when they have a chance  everybody  to get a decent education and learn new skills  when we support research into medical breakthroughs or new technologies  we believe america is stronger when everybody can count on affordable health insurance and medicare and social security  we think america is stronger when there are rules some rules in place to protect our kids from toxic dumping  to protect consumers from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous credit card companies or mortgage lenders  we think that washington has a role to play in making sure that we're creating great infrastructure roads and bridges in our country  so that we can move products and services everywhere  and then we also believe there are some things washington doesn't need to do  for example  washington shouldn't control the health care choices that women are capable of making for themselves  now  mentor  for   years  we had a president who shared these beliefs  his name was bill clinton  and his economic plan asked the wealthiest to pay a little bit more so we could reduce our deficit and still invest in the skills and ideas of our people  and at the time  when he first came into office  the republicans in congress and a senate candidate by the name of mitt romney   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  don't boo  vote  vote  the but they said that bill clinton's plan would hurt the economy  that it would kill jobs  and it turns out his math was just as bad back then as it is today   i laughter i  because by the end of president clinton's second term  america had created   million new jobs  incomes were up  poverty was down  our deficit had become a surplus  so  ohio  we know our ideas  we know they work  we also know the ideas of the other guys  they don't work  because we've tried those too  for most of the last decade  before i came into office  we tried giving big tax cuts to wealthy americans  we tried giving insurance companies and oil companies and wall street free license to do whatever they wanted to do  and what we got was falling incomes  record deficits  and the slowest job growth in half a century  all ending with a economic crisis that we've been cleaning up after ever since  so this isn't an abstract debate  we have tried our ideas  and they worked  we tried their ideas  and they don't work  governor romney  he's a very talented salesman  so in this campaign  he has tried as hard as he can to repackage the same policies that didn't work and offer them up as change  but here's the problem  ohio  we know what change looks like  and what he's offering ain't it  giving more power to the biggest banks  that's not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  another   trillion tax cut favoring the wealthy  that's not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  refusing to answer the details of your policies until after the election  that's definitely not change  that's the oldest trick in the book   i laughter i  ruling out compromise  pledging to rubberstamp the tea party agenda  that's not change  changing the facts when they're inconvenient to your campaign  that's definitely not change  but that's what governor romney has been doing these last few weeks right here in ohio  you've got folks who work at the jeep plant who've been calling their employers  worried  asking if their jobs were being shipped to china  you've heard about this  everybody heard about this   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  and the reason they're worried is because governor romney is running ads saying that jeep is shipping jobs to china  there's only one problem  it's not true  everybody knows it's not true  the car companies themselves told governor romney  knock it off  gm said   we think creating jobs in the united states should be a source of bipartisan pride  they don't want this to become some political football in governor romney's tv ad  and i couldn't agree more  look  i understand that governor romney has had a tough time here in ohio because he was against saving the auto industry  it's hard to run away from that position when you're on videotape saying  let's let detroit go bankrupt  but that's not a justification for running those kinds of ads  because this is not a game  these are people's jobs  these are people's livelihoods  our car companies  they're putting a lot of effort and time and energy and money into building up and restoring the brand of american cars  made in america  by american workers  you don't scare hardworking americans just to scare up some votes  that's not what being a president's all about  when i first made the decision to rescue the auto industry  i knew it wasn't popular  it wasn't even popular in ohio and michigan  but i also knew it was the right thing to do  betting on american workers was the right thing to do  betting on american ingenuity was the right thing to do  and that bet paid off  it paid off in lordstown and toledo  where companies are creating new jobs not in china  right here in ohio  right here in the united states  and this raises an essential part of what your choice is all about  because when you elect a president  you don't know what kinds of emergencies may happen  you don't know what problems he or she may deal with  but you do want to be able to trust your president  you want to know that your president means what he says and says what he means  and after   years as president  you know me  you may not agree with every decision i've made  you may at times have been frustrated by the pace of change  but you know what i believe  you know where i stand  you know i tell the truth  and you know i'll fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  you know that   i applause i  you know that  so when i talk about change  i know what real change looks like because i've fought for it  i've got the scars to prove it  i've got the gray hair to show for it   i laughter i  and you fought for change too  and after all we've been through together  we can't turn back  we can't give up on it now  change let me tell you the change i see moving forward  change is a country where everybody has a shot at a great education  and that means parents have to parent and teachers have to teach  but don't tell me that hiring more teachers won't help grow this economy  don't tell me that students who can't afford college should just borrow more money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me  and i'll bet it wasn't an option for a whole lot of you  that's why i want to cut the growth in tuition  over the next   years i want to cut the growth in half  i want to recruit   math and science teachers so our kids don't fall behind the rest of the world  i want to train   million americans at our community colleges with the skills businesses are looking for right now  that's the kind of change we need  that's what we're fighting for in this election  change real change means we live up to this country's legacy of innovation  the great thing about what's happened in the auto industry  we're not just building cars again  we're building better cars  cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  today  there are thousands of workers here in ohio and across the country who are building long lasting batteries and wind turbines  and i don't i want to make sure they keep building them here  i don't want tax codes that subsidize oil company profits when they're already making money hand over fist  i want to help and support clean energy jobs here in ohio and the new technology that will help us cut our oil imports in half  i don't want a tax code that rewards companies for shipping jobs overseas  i want to give tax breaks and reward companies that are creating the next generation of manufacturing right here in america  making american products  stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's my plan for jobs and growth  that's what's at stake in this election  change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home  as long as i'm commander in chief  i will make sure that we pursue our enemies with the strongest military the world's ever known  but it's time to use the savings from ending the war in iraq and winding down the war in afghanistan to pay down our debt and rebuild america  repairing roads and bridges and schools all across our country and putting our veterans back to work  because anybody who has served or country and fought for its freedom shouldn't have to fight for a job when they come home  that's what i believe  that's my commitment to them  and that's what's at stake in this election  change is a future where we reduce our deficit  but we do it in a balanced  responsible way  i've signed a trillion dollars' worth of spending cuts  i want to do more  but if we're serious about the deficit  then we've got to ask the wealthiest americans folks like me and governor romney to go back to the tax rates that were paid when bill clinton was president  and the reason i applause i first of all  i promise you we can afford it   i laughter i  second of all  a budget is choices  and if we're serious about reducing the deficit  then we've got to make choices  and as long as i'm president  i will never try to reduce the deficit on the backs of middle class folks and poor folks  i'm not going to turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i'm not going to make it more expensive for young people to go to college just to give me a tax break  ohio  we know what change is  we know what the future requires  but we also know it's not going to be easy  we know it's not going to be easy  back in   when i was talking about change we can believe in  i wasn't just talking about changing presidents  i wasn't just talking about changing parties  i was talking about changing our politics  i ran back in   because the voices of the american people your voices had been shut out of our democracy for too long by lobbyists and special interests and politicians who were willing to do whatever it takes and say whatever it takes just to keep things the way they are  and over the last   years  the status quo in washington  the protectors of the status quo  they have fought us every step of the way  they spent millions to try to stop us from reforming health care so that erin could get the care that she needs  they spent millions trying to prevent us from reforming wall street so we don't have another taxpayer funded bailout  they engineered a strategy of gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise on ideas that democrats and republicans had supported in the past  and what they're counting on now  ohio  is that you'll be so worn down by all the squabbling and all the dysfunction that you'll finally just give up and walk away and put them back in power   i audience members i  no   i the president i  that's what they're counting on  in other words  their bet's on cynicism  but ohio  my bet's on you  my bet's on you  my bet's on you  and by the way  i don't feel cynical  i feel hopeful  because of you  and every fight we've fought i've known that there are millions of people all across the country who care about that fight and support us  when the and by the way  when the other party has been willing to work with me to help middle class families  like cutting taxes for middle class families and small businesses or when some senators came across the aisle to help repeal  don't ask  don't tell  i've welcomed that  i want to see more cooperation in washington  and i will work with anybody  of any party  to move this country forward  and if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders who feel the same way  whether they're democrats  republicans  independents  people who are serious about putting people first  not the next election first  but if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals that will end up kicking students off of financial aid or getting rid of funding for planned parenthood or letting insurance companies discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or eliminating health care for millions on medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled  i'm not going to have that  that's not a price i'll pay  that's not bipartisanship  that's not real change  that's surrender to the same status quo that's been hurting middle class families for way too long  and i don't know about you  but i'm not ready to give up on that fight  and i hope you aren't either  ohio  i hope you aren't weary  i hope you still got some fight left in you   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  because  understand  the folks at the very top in this country  they don't need a champion in washington  they've always got a seat at the table  they always have access and influence  the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day  the laid off furniture worker who's going back to a community college to retrain for a job of the future  she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who needs a loan to expand after his bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and the waiters and the cleaning staff working overtime at a vegas hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college  they need a champion  our police and firefighters and ems folks  our first responders who make sacrifices thinking about others before they think about themselves  they need a champion  our autoworkers who got laid off and now are back on the job with so much dignity and pride  building great cars  they need champions  that teacher in an overcrowded classroom  digging into her own pocket to pay for school supplies  trying to make a difference in kids' lives  she needs a champion  all those kids  all those young people in inner cities and small farm towns  in the rolling hills of virginia and the valleys of ohio and right here in mentor  kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors  engineers  entrepreneurs  diplomats  maybe presidents  they need a champion in washington  because the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo  but it's the future that we've got to fight for  it's the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace  and that's why i need you  ohio  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  i want to keep fighting for you  and we've come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our voices grow faint  it's time to keep pushing forward to educate all our kids  train all our workers  create new jobs  rebuild our infrastructure  discover new sources of energy  broaden opportunity  grow our middle class  restore our democracy so that no matter who you are or where you come from  what you look like  how you started out  you can achieve the american dream  that's what we're fighting for  that's why i need your vote  and if you're willing to knock on doors with me and make some phone calls with me and early vote for me and turn out on tuesday for me  we'll win ohio  we'll win this election  we'll strengthen the bonds between us and reaffirm the spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  how's it going  milwaukee  oh  it is good to be back in wisconsin  now  listen  you know i'm working hard because my voice is getting a little raspy  so  folks in the back  if you can't hear me  you let me know  are you guys all right back there  it is good to be this close to home  can everybody please give it up for katy perry for performing earlier  and i just have to say katy has been working so hard these last couple of weeks  and i'm so grateful to her  and i also want you to give it up for a great team of folks who fight for wisconsin and for america every single day  herb kohl  gwen moore  tom barrett  and your next united states senator  tammy baldwin  now  wisconsin  for the past several days  all of us have been focused on what's happening on the east coast and one of the worst storms we've ever seen  i spent this morning talking to local and state officials there  and the loss of life  the hardships that folks are going through  are just heartbreaking  and it's a reminder of how fragile things are sometimes  and as a nation  we've got to mourn those who've been lost  our thoughts and prayers go out to their families  we're going to stay with the folks whose lives have been upended every step of the way until we have fully rebuilt  that's what america does  that's what we're about  because the thing is  in the midst of these tragedies  we're also inspired by the heroes that run into buildings and wade through water  neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy  leaders of different political parties working together to fix what's broken  it's a spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is  no matter how tough times may get  we always bounce back  because we're all in this together  we rise or fall as one nation and as one people  and that spirit has guided this nation along its improbable journey for more than two centuries  and it's what carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last   years  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst crisis since the great depression  today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  the american auto industry is back on top  home values are on the rise  we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last   years  and because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is coming to a close  al qaida is on the run  usama bin laden is dead  so we've made real progress these past   years  but  wisconsin  we're all gathered here today because we've got more work to do  as long as there's a single american who wants a job  but can't find one  our work is not yet done  as long as there are families working harder  but falling behind  our work is not yet done  as long as there's a child anyplace in milwaukee  anyplace in wisconsin  anyplace in this country who's languishing in poverty and barred from opportunity  our fight goes on  our fight goes on because this nation cannot succeed without a growing  thriving middle class  our fight goes on because america has always done best when everybody has got a fair shot  everybody is doing their fair share  everybody is playing by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why you elected me in   that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  wisconsin  in   days  you have a choice to make  it's not a choice between two candidates or two parties  it's a choice between two very different visions for our future  it's a choice between a return to the top down economics that caused our economy to crash   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  vote  it's a choice between that and a future that's built on making sure everybody is playing their part  that we're creating a strong and growing middle class  but also ladders of opportunity for people who are willing to work hard to get into that middle class  and listen  keep in mind  we don't  as americans  expect success to be handed to us  as americans  we honor the strivers and the dreamers and the risk takers  the entrepreneurs and the small business people  everybody the folks who are the driving force behind our free enterprise system  the greatest engine of growth and prosperity the world's ever known  but we also believe that for our markets and for free enterprise to succeed  everybody has to have a shot  opportunity has to be open to everybody  not just some  we think our country succeeds when everybody has the chance to get a good education and learn new skills  when we support research into new energy sources and medical breakthroughs  we believe america is stronger when everybody can count on affordable health care  when medicare and social security are there for our golden years  when there are rules in place to protect our kids from toxic dumping and mercury pollution  when there are rules in place to protect consumers from unscrupulous credit card companies or mortgage lenders  we believe that our democracy works best when everybody has a voice  we believe that politicians in washington need to stay in touch with what's happening on the ground and that there's some things they should leave alone  for example  making sure that health care choices for women are controlled by women  as opposed to controlled by politicians in washington  now  for   years  we had a president who shared these beliefs  his name was bill clinton  his economic policies  when he first came into office  asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more so we could reduce our deficit and invest in the skills and ideas of our people  and at the time  the republican congress and a senate candidate by the name of mitt romney   i audience members i  boo   i audience member i  don't boo   i the president i  vote  they said that bill clinton's plan would hurt the economy and kill jobs  does that sound familiar   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  that's what they said  turns out  their math was just as bad back then as it is now  because by the end of bill clinton's second term  america had created   million new jobs  and incomes were up  and poverty was down  and our deficit had turned into a surplus  so  wisconsin  we know what ideas work  we know our ideas work  and we know that their ideas don't work   i applause i  we know it  and the reason we know it is we just tried it a few years ago  after bill clinton was out of office  they tried their ideas  we tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans  we tried giving insurance companies and wall street a free rein to do whatever they pleased  and what we got was falling incomes  record deficits  slowest job growth in   years  and an economic crisis that we're still cleaning our way out of  so we know what works  and we know what doesn't  and governor romney  now  is a very talented salesman  so in this campaign  he's trying as hard as he can to repackage the same old ideas that didn't work and offer them up as change  he's saying he's the candidate of change  lo and behold  now  here's the thing though  we know what change looks like  and what governor romney is offering ain't it  giving more power to the biggest banks  that's not change  another   trillion tax cut to the wealthiest americans  that's not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  refusing to answer details about your policies until after the election  that's definitely not change   i laughter i  we've heard that from politicians before  ruling out compromise  pledging to rubberstamp the tea party's agenda in congress  that's not change  changing the facts when they're inconvenient to your campaign  that's definitely not change  now  that's the attitude we need to get rid of  wisconsin  after   years as president  you know me  so i applause i  you know me  you've watched me age before your eyes   i laughter i  and you may not agree with every decision i've made  sometimes  you may have been frustrated by the pace of change  but you know where i stand  you know what i believe  you know i mean what i say and i say what i mean  you know i tell the truth  when i said i'd end the war in iraq  i ended the war in iraq  when i said i'd end  don't ask  don't tell  i ended  don't ask  don't tell  when i said i'd pass health care reform  i passed health care reform  when i said that i'd cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses  that's what i did  you know that i'll fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  and that's why i'm running for a second term  because i keep my word and i want to keep fighting for you  i know what change i know what real change looks like  because i've fought for it  and so have you  i've got the scars to prove it  and after all we've been through together  we can't give up now   i audience members i  no   i the president i  we need to keep on going because we've got more change to bring about  so let me paint that vision of change for you  change is a country where every american has a shot at a good education  don't tell me hiring more teachers won't help this economy grow  don't tell me that students who can't afford college should just borrow money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me  i'll bet it's not an option for a lot of you  that's why i want to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next   years  that's why i want to recruit   math and science teachers so our kids don't fall behind the rest of the world  i want to train   million americans at our community colleges with the skills that businesses are looking for right now  that's what we're fighting for in this election  that's what real change is  that's what we're fighting for  change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation  i'm very proud i bet on american workers and american ingenuity and the american auto industry  but what i'm especially proud of is  we're not just building cars again  we're building better cars  cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  but it doesn't stop at autos  we're innovating everywhere  today  there are thousands of workers building long lasting batteries and wind turbines and working to figure out new sources of fuel all across the country  and i want to make sure we're not having a tax code that subsidizes oil company profits when they're already making a lot of money  i want to support the new sources of energy  the jobs of tomorrow  the technology that will cut our oil imports in half and help our national security and help our environment  that's what change is  i don't want a tax code that rewards companies for shipping jobs overseas  i want to reward companies that are investing right here in milwaukee  investing in wisconsin  investing in the next generation of manufacturing  that's the future i see for our country  and i know it's there  it's ready  within our grasp  change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home  as long as i'm commander in chief  we will pursue our enemies with the strongest military the world's ever known  but it's time to use some of the savings from ending the iraq war  winding down the afghan war  to pay down our debt and rebuild america  let's put some folks to work right now rebuilding roads  bridges  making sure our schools are state of the art  let's lay broadband lines into our rural communities  and let's use our veterans let's make sure they've got jobs because when you've fought for our freedom  you shouldn't have to fight for a job when you come home  that's my plan to keep us strong  that's my commitment  and that's what's at stake in this election  and yes  change is a future where we reduce our deficit  but we do it in a balanced way  i've signed a trillion dollars' worth of cuts  i am prepared to do more  but if we're serious about the deficit  we've also got to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the tax rates they paid when bill clinton was in office  because budgets are about choices  and if you're going to reduce the deficit  something has got to give  and as long as i'm president  i'm not going to turn medicare into a voucher  making our seniors more vulnerable  just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i'm not going to ask young people to pay more for college so i get a tax cut  so we know what change is  we know what the future requires  and  wisconsin  we know it won't be easy  the next phase of change will not be easy  back in   i know a lot of folks  they were swept up in the excitement and had the posters and but sometimes maybe people didn't hear me when i said change we believe in is no just changing presidents  it's not just changing parties  it's changing our politics  it's changing the system  i ran because the voices of the american people your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long  by lobbyists and special interests  politicians who were willing to do whatever it takes  say whatever it takes just to keep things the way they are  the protectors of the status quo  over the last   years  those protectors of the status quo in washington  they have fought us every step of the way  spent millions of dollars to stop us from reforming the health care system  spent millions trying to stop us from reforming wall street  they engineered a strategy of gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise on ideas that democrats and republicans used to agree to in the past  and the reason they did it is because they're counting on you to be so worn down by all the squabbling  so tired of all the dysfunction  that you just give up  you walk away  you leave them in power   i audience members i  no   i the president i  in other words  wisconsin  their bet is on cynicism  they figure they can outlast you   i audience members i  no   i the president i  they figure  you know what  yes  these guys may get enthusiastic  but over time  that enthusiasm fades away  and we're still here  but  wisconsin  see  my bet is on you  my bet is on the goodness and decency of the american people  and by the way  the point i'm making here is not partisan  when the other party has been with me to fight for middle class families  i've loved working with them  when we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses  that was bipartisan  when we repealed  don't ask  don't tell  there were some courageous republicans in the senate who voted with us  that was leadership  i will work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  and if you really want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders who feel the same way whether they're democrats  republicans  independents people who put you first  who put the american people first  not the elections first or partisan advantage first or special interests first or big money contributors first or super pacs first  but put the people of wisconsin first  that's what you should be thinking about  but you know what  there are going to be some fights sometimes  because there are fights that need to be had to bring about change and push through the resistance of the status quo  if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals that will kick students off of financial aid or get rid of funding for planned parenthood or let insurance companies go back to discriminating against people with preexisting conditions or eliminate health care for millions on medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled  that's not a deal i'm willing to take  that's not a price you should want your president to pay  that's not bipartisanship  that's not change  that's surrender to a status quo that's doesn't work for middle class families  and i'm not ready to give up on the fight  i'm not ready to give up on the fight  and i hope you aren't either  wisconsin  i hope you aren't either  the folks at the very top in this country  they don't need another champion in washington  they always have a seat at the table  they'll always have access  they'll always have influence  the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night after my work in the office is done  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day  a laid off worker who's gone back to community college at the age of   to try to retrain for a biotech job  she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who needs a loan to expand his small restaurant after the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and the waiters and the cleaning staff working overtime in a vegas hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who thought he'd never see his plant reopen and who's now back on the job  filled with pride and dignity of building a great car  helping to build america  he needs a champion  that teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated schoolbooks  digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies  but never giving up hope that she can change lives of some child in her class  she needs a champion  all those kids in inner cities and small farm towns  in the rolling hills of virginia or the valleys of ohio or right here in milwaukee kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors  engineers or entrepreneurs  diplomats  maybe a president they need a champion  because the future will never have lobbyists like the status quo does  but the dreams of those kids will be our saving grace  that's what we're fighting for  that's what this election is about  that's why i need you  that's why i need you  wisconsin  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we have come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our hearts grow weary  to let our hearts grow faint  now is the time to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids  train all our workers  create new jobs  rebuild our infrastructure  discover new sources of energy  broaden opportunity  grow our middle class  restore our democracy  and make sure that no matter where you come from  no matter how you started out  no matter what you look like  no matter who you love  no matter what your last name is  here in america  you can make it if you try  that's what we're fighting for  wisconsin  that's why i'm asking for your vote  and if you're willing to work with me and knock on doors with me and make some phone calls with me and turn out with me and grab your friends and your neighbors and your coworkers and get them to the polls for me  we'll win wisconsin  we'll win this election  we'll renew the bonds that tie us together and reaffirm the spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  virginia  are you fired up   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  are you ready to go   i audience members i  yes   i the president   i you've got to be fired up after bill clinton  he has been traveling all across the country for this campaign  he's been laying out the stakes so well that our team basically calls him the secretary of explaining stuff   i laughter i  the only clinton working harder than him is our secretary of state  hillary clinton  and i am so grateful to both of them  the only problem is  i was in the back  i was enjoying listening to president clinton so much  i had to run up to get my cue   i laughter i  i was sitting there  just soaking it all in   i laughter i  he was a great president  he has been a great friend  so i want everybody to give president bill clinton a big round of applause  speaking of outstanding public servants  your next senator  your former governor  tim kaine  is in the house  your outstanding congressman  gerry connolly  is here  and i want everybody to please thank dave matthews for the outstanding performance  now   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  and i'm glad to see all of you  for the past several days  obviously  all of us have been focused on the devastation that's been taking place all along the east coast  virginia got hit  but was spared some of the worst brunt of the storm  but i've been to new jersey  we've been on the phone every day with folks from connecticut and new york  and as a nation  we mourn those who have been lost  our hearts and prayers go out to the families who are going through just some unbearable pain  so many folks have been impacted  it's going to be a long  hard road to recovery  but every time i've spoken to folks in the region  what i've told them is that america will be with them every step of the way  america will be there on this hard road ahead  we will help them rebuild together  because that's what we do as americans  which is why  during the course of tragedy  we've also been inspired over these last few days by heroes  firefighters and national guardsmen and women  and ems folks and police officers running into buildings  wading through water  neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy  leaders of different political parties working together to fix what's broken  not worrying about who's getting credit  not worrying about the politics of it  a spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is  we bounce back  no matter how tough times are  we're all in this together  we rise or fall as one nation and as one people  and that spirit that spirit has guided this country along its improbable journey for more than two centuries  it's what's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last   years  remember in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  the american auto industry is back on top  home values are on the rise  housing construction is coming back  we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last   years  because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is coming to a close  al qaida has been decimated  usama bin laden is dead  we are safer than we were   years ago  so we've made real progress  virginia  we've made real progress  but  virginia  we're here tonight not only to listen to dave matthews i laughter i we not only to hear the master  bill clinton  break things down for us  but we're also here because we've got more work to do  as long as there's a single american who wants a job and can't find one  our work is not yet done  as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind  our work is not yet done  as long as there's a child anywhere in virginia  anywhere in this country  who is still languishing in poverty and barred from opportunity  our work is not yet done  we've got more work to do  our fight goes on  virginia  because we know this nation can't succeed without a growing  thriving middle class  our fight goes on because america has always done best when everybody has a fair shot and everybody's doing their fair share and everybody's playing by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why you elected bill clinton in '  that's why you elected me in '  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states  now   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  virginia  in   days  you've got a choice to make  and even if you've made the choice  you've got to go talk to some folks who haven't  and you've got to tell them it's not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  it's a choice between two different visions of america  it's a choice between top down economics that crashed our economy  or bottom up  middle out economics that create a strong and growing middle class  as americans  we honor the strivers and the dreamers  the entrepreneurs  the small businesspeople  the risk takers who are the driving force behind our free enterprise system  and we believe the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of growth and prosperity the world has ever known  but we also know  in this country  the market works best  the free enterprise system works best  more businesses are created  more jobs are created  when everybody has a chance to succeed  when everybody has the chance to get a good education and learn new skills  when we support research into medical breakthroughs or new technologies  because we know that we can't do that on our own  we've got to pool our resources to discover the future  we know that america is stronger when everybody can count on affordable health insurance  when everybody can count on medicare and social security to give them a dignified retirement  we know the market works better when there are rules of the road to protect kids from toxic dumping  to protect consumers from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous credit card companies or mortgage lenders  we believe that there's a role for rules and regulations that are smart  and then we also believe there are some things we should leave to the people  for example  we don't think politicians in washington are very smart about controlling health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making themselves  now  for   years  we had a president who shared these beliefs  you just heard him  president clinton's economic plan asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more so we could reduce our deficit and invest in the skills and ideas of our people  and the interesting thing is  at the time  the republicans in congress and a certain senate candidate by the name of mitt romney   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo   i audience members i  vote   i the president i  you got to vote  don't boo  but this senate candidate named mitt romney said that bill clinton's plan would hurt the economy and would kill jobs  sound familiar   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  it turns out his math was just as bad back then as it is today   i laughter i  because by the end of president clinton's second term  america had created   million new jobs  incomes were up  poverty was down  our deficit became the biggest surplus in history  so  virginia  we know our ideas work  what about their ideas  we tried those too  after bill clinton left office  for   years we tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans  we tried to strip away regulations so that wall street and insurance companies and oil companies were free to do whatever they pleased  and what did we get  falling incomes  record deficits  the slowest job growth in half a century  and an economic crisis that we've been cleaning up after ever since  so we tried one way  it worked  we tried another way  it didn't work which presents a dilemma for governor romney  since he wants to go back to the same policies that didn't work  now  governor romney is a very talented salesman  so in this campaign  he has tried as hard as he can to repackage these same ideas  and he's got  i think president clinton called it  the brass  to call it change   i laughter i  now  let me tell you  we know what change looks like  we know what change looks like  and what governor romney's selling ain't it  giving more power to the biggest banks isn't change  another   trillion tax cut for the wealthy  that's not change  refusing to answer questions about the details of your policies until after the election  that's definitely not change  ruling out compromise by pledging to rubberstamp the tea party folks in congress  that's not change   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  changing the facts when they're inconvenient to your campaign not change  i mean  that's old  that's the attitude in washington that needs to change  now  virginia  after   years as president  you know me  you know me  so when you're trying to sort through this argument about change  part of what you have to ask yourself is  who do you trust   i audience members i  you   i the president i  when you're talking about the economy and policy that's so critical to our future  you've got to ask yourself  who do you trust   i audience members i  you   i the president i  you may not agree with every decision i've made michelle doesn't agree with every decision i've made   i laughter i  there may be times when you're frustrated at the pace of change  i'm frustrated sometimes with the pace of change  but you know i mean what i say and i say what i mean  you know what i believe  you know where i stand  when i said we'd end the war in iraq  we ended it  when i said we'd pass health care reform  we passed it  when i said we'd repeal  don't ask  don't tell  we repealed it  you know i tell the truth  and most importantly  you know i will fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  so let me tell you  i know what real change looks like because i've fought for it  i've got the scars to prove it  and you have too  and after all we've been through together  we can't give up on it now  we've got to keep pushing forward  that's why i'm running for a second term  that's why i need your vote   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  virginia  let me describe very briefly i know folks are cold but let me describe i laughter i what am i talking about when i'm talking about forward  what do you i mean by real change  change is a country where every american has a shot at a great education  now  government alone can't do that  parents  you got to parent  students  you got to study  but don't tell me that hiring more teachers won't help our economy grow  don't tell me that students who can't afford college should just borrow money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me  it wasn't an option for bill clinton  i'll bet it's not an option for a lot of you  that's why i want to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next   years  that's why i want to recruit   math and science teachers so we don't fall behind the rest of the world  that's why i want to train   million americans at our community colleges to get the skills businesses are hiring for right now  that's real change  that's what we're fighting for in this election  that's what's at stake  i want us to live up to this country's legacy of innovation  i'm proud i bet on american workers and the american auto industry  but i'm even prouder we're not just building cars again  we're building better cars  cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that kind of innovation  that kind of forward thinking  we don't have to restrict it just to the auto industry  i want to bring manufacturing back on all kinds of things  we've got thousands of workers building long lasting batteries  building wind turbines all across the country  so instead of subsidizing oil companies' profits when they're making money hand over fist  i want to support energy jobs of tomorrow  which will cut our oil imports in half  which will help our environment  help our national security  i don't want a tax code that rewards companies for creating those jobs overseas  i want to reward companies that are creating those jobs in virginia  that's the future i see for this country  change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can focus on nation building here at home  as long as i'm commander in chief  we'll pursue our enemies with the strongest military the world's ever known  and virginia carries more than its load when it comes to defending this country  and we are grateful to this state  but we also understand  to be strong it's time to use some of the savings from winding down two wars to pay down our debt and rebuild america  fixing roads  putting folks back to work rebuilding our bridges  making sure our schools are state of the art  and that's especially important for our veterans  we want to put them to work  because if they have fought for our country and defended our freedom  they shouldn't have to fight for a job when they come home  that's my commitment to them  that's what's at stake in this election  and president clinton talked about it  we've got to reduce our deficit  that's real change  but we've got to do it in a balanced  responsible way  i've cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending  we can do more  but if we're serious about deficit reduction  if we're not just using it in tv ads and then once you get into office like dick cheney  he said  doesn't matter then we also have to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the tax rates that they paid when president clinton was in office  and the reason is because budgets are about choices  about priorities  what are we going to invest in  as long as i'm president  i'm not going to turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  so  virginia  we know what change is  we know what the future requires  we know also that it won't be easy  back in   i talked about this  i warned some of you maybe you weren't believing me i said  change  real change  isn't just about changing presidents or changing parties  it's about changing our politics  i ran because the voices of the american people your voices had been shut out of our democracy for too long by lobbyists and special interests and politicians who were willing to say anything and do anything just to keep things the way they are  the protectors  the guardians of the status quo  and that status quo in washington has fought us every step of the way over the last   years  they spent millions of dollars trying to prevent us from reforming health care  millions of dollars trying to prevent us from reforming wall street  they engineered a strategy of gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise on ideas that in the past both democrats and republicans had supported  and what they're counting on now is that you're going to be so worn down by all the squabbling  so tired of the dysfunction  so weary of what goes on  on capitol hill  that you're just going to give up and walk away   i audience members i  no   i the president   i and just put them back in power or let them stay there  in other words  their bet is on cynicism  but  virginia  my bet's on you  my bet's on you and the decency and the good sense of the american people  and it's not a partisan bet i'm making  when the other party has been willing to work with me to help the middle class  i'm right there with them  i'm happy about it  i would have less gray hair if they're ready to go  come on   i laughter i  when we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses  we had some republican support  that was great  we had some courageous republican senators work with us to repeal  don't ask  don't tell  we celebrated them  we embraced them  i'll work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  and if virginia  if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders like tim kaine who feel the same way  whether they're democrats  republicans  or independents  leaders who will put people first and put the election aside for a moment  but we're still going to have some fights because there are some values that are at stake  there are some principles we've got to fight for  if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals that will kick students off financial aid or get rid of funding for planned parenthood or let insurance companies discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or eliminate health care for millions on medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled or kick kids off of head start  i'm not buying that  that's not a price i'm willing to pay  that's not bipartisanship  that's not change  that's surrender to the same status quo that has hurt middle class families and everybody who is striving to get into the middle class for way too long  and  virginia  i'm here and i'm running for a second term because i'm not ready to give up on that fight  i'm not ready to give up on that fight  and i hope you aren't either   i audience members   i no   i the president i  i hope you aren't either   i audience members i  no   i the president i  the folks at the very top in this country don't need another champion in washington  they will always have a seat at the table  they'll always have access and influence  regardless of who is president  they'll find a way to have their voices heard  they've got money they can spend  there are lobbyists they can hire  the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night after a long day in the office  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day  the laid off furniture worker who's having to retrain at the age of   for a new career in a new industry  she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who has got great food but needs a loan to expand and the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and the wait staff and the cleaning staff working overtime in some vegas hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kids to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who got laid off and thought the plant would never reopen and now he's back on the job  filled with pride and dignity  not just because he's building a great car  but he knows he's building america  he needs a champion  that teacher who is in an overcrowded classroom  digging into her own pocket for school supplies  not always getting the support she needs  but knowing every day  maybe she's touching that one child and something is going to break through  she needs a champion  all those kids in inner cities and small farm towns  in the valleys of ohio  in these rolling virginia hills  kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors or engineers or entrepreneurs or diplomats or businessmen or even a president  they need a champion in washington because they don't have lobbyists  the future never has lobbyists  but it's the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace  and that's why i need you  virginia  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we have come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint  now is the time to keep pushing forward  educate all our kids  train all our workers  create new jobs  rebuild our infrastructure  discover new sources of energy  broaden opportunity  grow our middle class  restore our democracy  and make sure that no matter who you are  no matter where you come from  no matter what you look like  no matter what your last name is  no matter who you love  you can make it in america if you try  and  virginia  that's why i'm asking for your vote  i was backstage with david plouffe  some of you guys know he's sort of a mastermind of campaign organization  and we were talking about how  as the campaign goes on  we become less relevant  i'm sort of a prop in the campaign   i laughter i  he's just bothering a bunch of folks calling  asking what's going on  but the power the power is not with us anymore  the planning  everything we do  it doesn't matter because now it's all up to you  it's up to the volunteers  it's up to somebody knocking on a door  it's up to somebody making a phone call  it's up to somebody talking to their mom or their dad  or their wife or their husband  or grandma or grandpa  and that's how democracy is supposed to be  it's up to you  you've got the power  and that's why i need you  virginia  don't get tired  don't get weary  if you're willing to knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls for me  grab some friends for me  turn out to vote for me  we'll win virginia  we'll win this election  we'll finish what we started  we'll move forward  together we'll renew the bonds and reaffirm the spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless the united states of america

of the finest congressional delegations anyplace in the country right here in colorado  we're so proud of all of them  please give them a big round of applause  now  for the past several days  all of us have been focused on not just elections  but we've been focused on what's been happening on the east coast  one of the worst storms of our lifetime  and as a nation  we mourn those who were lost  and unfortunately  the people of this town understand what it means to grieve better than most  because the wounds of that terrible shooting are still fresh in people's minds  but just as you've begun to heal as a community  we're going to help our friends on the east coast heal as well  we're going to walk with the people whose lives have been upended  those who've lost loved ones  we're going to walk with them every step of the way in the hard road ahead  because that's what we do as americans  we help our neighbors and friends rebuild  we will carry on with a spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is  we come back  no matter how tough times are  we will thrive  because we're all in this together and we rise or fall as one nation and as one people  colorado  that spirit has guided us along this improbable journey for more than two centuries  it's carried us through the trials of the last   years  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  and today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  the american auto industry is back on top  home values are on the rise  we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time

al qaida is on the run  usama bin laden is dead  we've made progress these last   years  we've made progress these last   years  but  colorado  the reason you're all here aside from wanting to hear dave matthews is that we've got more work to do  as long as there's a single american who wants a job  but can't find one  our work is not yet done  as long as there's a family working harder and harder and still falling behind  our work isn't done yet  as long as there's a child anywhere in colorado  anywhere in the united states  who's languishing in poverty  barred from opportunity  our work isn't done  our fight goes on  our fight goes on because this nation cannot succeed without a growing and thriving middle class and strong and sturdy ladders for folks who are willing to work to get into the middle class  our fight goes on because america always does best when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why you elected me  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i audience members i  obama  obama  obama   i the president i  now  colorado  in   days  everybody in the country has got a choice to make  you've already made a choice  many of you  but there's still a lot of folks who have yet to cast their ballots  and they've got a choice between two candidates and two parties  but more importantly  between two visions of our country  it's a choice between returning to the top down policies that crashed our economy or a vision of our economy that grows from the middle class out  from the bottom up  and as americans  we honor free enterprise  free market  the strivers  the dreamers  the business folks  the risk takers who have always been the driving force behind our economic growth  the greatest engine of growth and prosperity the world has ever known  but what we also believe is our markets  our free enterprise system  it works best when everybody is participating  when everybody has a chance to succeed  when everybody has a decent education and everybody is learning new skills  and when we're investing in research and medical breakthroughs and new technologies  we think we're stronger when everybody has affordable health care  when everybody has medicare and social security that they can count on in their golden years  we think our markets work better when there are rules in place to protect our kids from toxic dumping or mercury pollution  rules to protect consumers from being taken advantage of by an unscrupulous credit card company or mortgage lender  and then there are some things we actually think government shouldn't be involved with  for example  we don't think politicians in washington should be controlling health care choices women are perfectly capable of making themselves  now  colorado  for   years  we had a president who shared these beliefs  his name was bill clinton  and his economic plan asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more so we could reduce our deficit and invest in the skills and ideas of our people  and at the time  you may be surprised to learn that the republican congress and a senate candidate by the name of mitt romney said bill clinton's plan would kill jobs  kill the economy  turns out  their math back then was just as bad as it is now   i laughter i  because by the end of president clinton's second term  america had created   million new jobs  incomes were up  poverty was down  our deficit had become a surplus  so  colorado  we know our ideas work because they've been tested  they've been tried  and we also know that the other folks' ideas don't work because they've been tested   i laughter i  now  after bill clinton left office  for most of the last decade  we tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans that we couldn't afford  we tried giving insurance companies and oil companies and wall street the license to do whatever they pleased  and what we got was falling incomes and record deficits and the slowest job growth in half a century and an economic crisis that we've been cleaning up after ever since  so we've got ideas that work  we've got ideas that don't   i laughter i  we've tried both  we should be able to make a pretty clear choice  but you've got to give him credit  governor romney is a pretty talented salesman   i laughter i  and in this campaign  he has tried as hard as he can to repackage the same old bad ideas that didn't work and offer them up as new ideas  he says they're change   i audience member i  chump change   i laughter i   i the president i  chump change   i laughter i  he says they're change  now  here's the thing  we know what change looks like  and what he's selling ain't it  giving more power to the biggest banks is not change  giving another   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy  not change   i audience members i  chump change   i the president i   i laughter i  refusing to answer questions about the details of your policies until after the election is over  that's definitely not change   i audience members i  chump change   i the president i  ruling out compromise by pledging to rubberstamp the tea party's agenda in congress  not change   i audience members i  chump change   i the president i  changing the facts when they're inconvenient to your own campaign  well  we've seen that before  that's not change   i audience members i  chump change   i the president i  you guys get the idea   i laughter i  not change  look  here is the thing  part of a presidential race is about policy  and part of it is about trust  you've got to have a sense of whether or not the person means what they say and say what they mean  and the thing is  colorado  after   years  you know me  you may not agree with every decision i've made  but michelle doesn't either   i laughter i  you may be frustrated sometimes by the pace of change  guess what  so am i  but you know what i believe  you know where i stand  you know i tell the truth  and you know that i will fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  so  colorado  i know what real change looks like because i've fought for it  because i've delivered it  because you've worked with me and lifted me up to be able to get some stuff done that is important to folks all across this country  you know what real change looks like  i've got the scars to prove it  i've got the gray hair i laughter i to show you   i audience member i  we love that hair   i laughter i   i the president i  i appreciate that   i laughter i  so after all we've been through together  we can't give up now   i audience members i  no   i the president i  let me paint for you the change we still need   i audience members i  chump change   i the president i  no  no  no  this is the change we want   i laughter i  you missed your cue on this one  change real change is a country where every american has got a shot at a great education  and that means parents  you have to parent  and students  you've got to study  but don't tell me that hiring more great teachers won't help grow this economy  of course it will  don't tell me that students who can't afford college should just borrow money from their parents   i audience members i  no   i the president i  that wasn't an option for me  i'll be it's not an option for a lot of you  and that's why i want to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next   years  i want to recruit   math and science teachers so our kids don't fall behind  i want to train   million americans in our community colleges with the skills that businesses are looking for right now  that's how we're going to grow  that's how we create jobs  that's what change is  that's what's at stake in this election  that's what we're fighting for in this election  change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation  i'm very proud that i bet on american workers and the american auto industry  but i'm not just proud because we're building cars  i'm proud because we're building better cars  cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that helps our economy  that helps your pocketbook  it helps our national security  it helps our environment  but we don't want to just stop innovating there  there are thousands of workers today building long lasting batteries and wind turbines and solar panels all across the country  and i want to make sure  instead of giving subsidies to oil company profits  i want to support the energy jobs of tomorrow  the new technologies that will cut our oil imports in half  i want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that reward tax breaks that reward companies that are shipping jobs overseas  reward companies that are investing here in america  in the next generation of manufacturing  that's how we grow an economy  that's how we create jobs  that's what i see for colorado  that's what i see for our future  change real change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home  as long as i am commander in chief  we will pursue our enemies with the strongest military the world's ever known  but it's time to use the savings from ending two wars to pay down our debt  rebuilding america  repairing roads and bridges  making sure our schools are state of the art  putting people back to work right now  especially our veterans  because anybody who has fought for our freedom should not have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads or the care that they need or the benefits they've earned when they come home  that's how we keep ourselves strong  by keeping our commitments to those who sacrifice so much  and that's also what's at stake in this election  and change is a future where we reduce our deficits in a balanced  responsible way  i've signed a trillion dollars' worth of spending cuts  i intend to do more  but if we're serious about reducing our deficit  we can't just cut our way to prosperity  there are some things we need to do to make sure we grow and put people back to work  and that means we've got to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the tax rates they paid when bill clinton was in office  now  the reason is because budgets are priorities  they reflect our values  i'm not going to kick a kid off of head start so i can get a tax break  i don't need it  as long as i'm president  i will not turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  that's not true to who we are  and that's not how we grow an economy  so  colorado  we know what real change is  we know what the future requires  and by the way  we also know it won't be easy  now  back in   we talked about change  and i wasn't just talking about changing presidents  i wasn't just talking about changing parties  i was talking about change in how we run our politics  i ran because the voices of the american people your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long  by the lobbyists and the special interests  the politicians who will say anything and do anything just to keep things the way they are  the protectors of the status quo  the status quo in washington is fierce  and it has fought us every step of the way  they spent millions of dollars to try to stop us from reforming health care  millions of dollars trying to stop us from reforming wall street  they engineered a strategy of gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise even on ideas that  in the past  both democrats and republicans agreed on  that's why we've got republicans opposed to a health care plan that started as a republican idea  implemented by a republican governor  and what they're counting on now is that you're going to be so worn down by all the squabbling  so tired of all the dysfunction  just fed up  that you give up and you walk away and you leave things the way they are and you put back those folks who have been protecting the status quo all these years back into power   i audience members i  no   i the president i  in other words  their bet is on cynicism  but  colorado  my bet's on you   i applause i  my bet's on you  the common sense  the decency of the american people  and the fact is  what we're describing is not partisan  it doesn't have to be  we're not democrats or republicans first  we're americans first  and when the other party has been willing to work with me to make sure that everybody has got a shot  i am right there with them  like when we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses  or when we came together to repeal  don't ask  don't tell  we had courageous republican senators who helped  i will work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  and if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders who feel the same way folks  whether they're democrats  republicans  independents people who put their constituencies first  people who put folks who are out there working hard  trying to live out their american dream  put them first  but sometimes there is going to be conflict  sometimes bringing about change is going to butt up against the status quo  and we've got to be willing to fight for what we believe in and what we care about and what has built this country  if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals that will kick students off of financial aid or get rid of funding for planned parenthood or let insurance companies discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or eliminate health care for millions who are on medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled  i'm not willing to pay that price  that's not bipartisanship  that's not real change  that's surrender to the same forces that have squeezed middle class families for way too long  and i'm not ready to give up on the fight  and  colorado  i hope you aren't either   i applause i  i hope you aren't either  see  the folks at the very top in this country don't need another champion in washington  they'll always have a seat at the table  they'll always have access  they'll always have influence  we understand that  but the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day  the laid off worker who's gone back to a community college at the age of   trying to get trained in a new career  she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who's got great food  but needs a loan to expand after the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and the waiters and the cleaning staff working overtime at a denver hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college  they need champion  the autoworker who thought he'd never be back on that assembly line  and now with pride and dignity  he's building a great car  he needs a champion  the young immigrant brought here when they were a child  pledging allegiance to our flag  gone to our schools  know themselves to be americans through and through except for a document  they need a champion  all those kids in inner cities and small farm towns  in the valleys of ohio or the hills of colorado kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors or engineers or entrepreneurs  businesspeople  diplomats  maybe even a president they need a champion in washington  because they don't have lobbyists  the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo does  as vested interests do  but it is the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace  and that's why i need you  colorado  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we have come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our heart grow weary  now is the time to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids  train all our workers  create new jobs  rebuild our infrastructure  bring our troops home  care for our veterans  broaden opportunity  grow our middle class  restore our democracy  make sure that here in america  no matter who you are  where you come from  how you started out  what you look like  it doesn't matter whether you're black or white  hispanic  asian  native american  young  old  rich  poor  able  disabled  gay  straight  here in america  you can make it if you try  that's why i need your vote  that's what we believe in  that's why we're pushing forward  and if you're willing to work with me and knock on some doors with me  make some phone calls with me  turn out for me  colorado  we will win this state  we'll win this election  we'll finish what we started  and we'll reaffirm the spirit and the bonds that make the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  god bless america  go out and vote "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  florida  are you fired up   i audience members i  yeah   i the president i  are you ready to go   i audience members i  yeah   i the president i  i'm sorry  i couldn't hear you  fired up   i audience members i  yeah   i the president i  ready to go   i audience members i  yeah  can everybody please give annabella a big round of applause for that great introduction  the stories like annabella's are why i got into public service in the first place  and i'm so proud of her and her family  and she's going to do great things  now  we also have here you former governor  charlie crist  give him a big round of applause  your outstanding senator for the next   years  bill nelson's in the house  representatives corrine brown and ted deutch and the chairwoman of the democratic party  debbie wasserman schultz  are all here  and let's hear it for your mayor  peter bober  now  and all of you are here  and i'm really happy about that  for the past several days  all of us have been focused on the storms that are taking place along the east coast  and obviously  florida knows something about storms  as a nation  we mourn those who've been lost  and i've been up to new jersey  i've been talking to the governors and the mayors every single day  and i want people to know that when i talk to them  i'm talking on behalf of america  and i have told them that we will be with them every step of the way until they have fully recovered from the hardships and the crisis  and we're going to do it together  because that's how we do in the united states of america  and as heartbroken as we've been by some of the images of families whose lives have been upended  we've also been inspired seeing police officers and firefighters and ems folks rushing into burning buildings and wading water to save lives  and neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy  leaders of different political parties working together to fix what's broken  we see a spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is  we'll always bounce back  no matter how tough times are  we're all in this together that we rise or fall as one nation and as one people  now  that spirit has guided this country along its improbable journey for more than two centuries  and it's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last   years  remember  in   we were in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the great depression  we were in the middle of two wars  and today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  the auto industry is back on top  home values are beginning to rise again  we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last   years  because of the amazing service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is coming to a close  al qaida is on the run  usama bin laden is dead  so we've made real progress  florida  these past   years  but we're here today  all of you are here today because you know and i know we've got more work to do  as long as there's a single american who wants a job but can't find one  our work is not yet done  as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind  our work is not yet done  as long as there's a child anywhere in florida  anywhere in the united states  who's still languishing in poverty  barred from opportunity  we know our fight's must go on  our fight goes on because this nation cannot succeed without a growing  thriving middle class  our fight goes on because america always does best when everybody has a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why you elected me in   and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  florida  in   days  you've got a choice to make  it's not just a choice between two parties or candidates  it's a choice between two different visions of america  on the one hand  you can choose the return to the top down policies that crashed our economy  or you can join me in building a future that focuses on a strong and growing middle class  as americans  we honor the businessmen and the strivers  the dreamers  the risk takers who have been the driving force behind our free enterprise system  the greatest engine of growth and prosperity the world's ever known  but we also believe that in this country  our economy grows best  the markets do best when everybody has a chance to succeed  when everybody is getting a good education  when every worker is learning new skills  when we're investing in research for medical breakthroughs and new technologies  we think america is stronger when everybody can count on affordable  quality health insurance  when we protect medicare and social security so that we guarantee dignity and respect in retirement  we think our economy works best when there are some rules in place to protect our kids from toxic dumping  from protecting consumers from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous credit card companies or mortgage lenders  and there are some things we don't want washington to do  for example  we don't want politicians in washington  most of whom are male  to control health care decisions that women can make for themselves  now  for   years  we had a president who shared these beliefs  his name was bill clinton  and his economic plan when he first came into office  he asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more so we could reduce our deficit and still invest in the skills and ideas of our people  and you know what  at the time  the republicans in congress and a senate candidate by the name of mitt romney   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  i don't want you to boo  i want you to vote  i want you to vote  but a republican candidate by the name of mitt romney said bill clinton's plans would hurt the economy and kill jobs  turns out his math was just as bad then as it is now   i laughter i  because by the end of president clinton's second term  america had created   million new jobs and incomes were up and poverty was down and our deficit had turned into a surplus  so  florida  we know that our ideas work  we also know that their ideas don't  because we tried their ideas too  we tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans  we tried giving insurance companies and oil companies and wall street free rein to do whatever they pleased  and you know what we got  we got falling incomes and record deficits and the slowest job growth in half a century and an economic crisis we've been cleaning up after ever since  so let's just think about this  here's your choice  you've got ideas that we've tried and didn't work  and you've got ideas that we tried that did work  so you'd think it would be a pretty clear choice  but governor romney is a very talented salesman  so in this campaign  he's tried as hard as he can to repackage these old ideas that didn't work and pretend that they're new ideas  and he's offering them up as change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  but here's the thing  florida  we know what change looks like  what governor romney is offering ain't it  giving more power back to the biggest banks  that's not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  another   trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy  that's not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  refusing to answer questions about the details of your policies until after the election  that's definitely not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  politicians have been doing that a long time  ruling out compromise by pledging to rubberstamp the tea party agenda in congress not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  changing the facts when they're inconvenient to your campaign  that's certainly is not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  and here's the thing  when you make this choice  part of what you're choosing is who do you trust   i audience members i  you   i the president i  because you don't know what crisis the next president is going to confront  you don't know what challenge we may have to meet that was unexpected  so part of what you're focused on is how does somebody operate  and  florida  after   years as president  you know me by now  you may not agree with every decision i've made  you know  michelle doesn't agree with every decision i've made   i laughter i  you may be frustrated sometimes at the pace of change  i'm frustrated by the pace of change sometimes  but here's the thing  is you know i say what i mean and i mean what i say  i said i'd end the war in iraq  i ended it  i said i'd pass health care reform  i passed it  i said i'd repeal  don't ask  don't tell  we repealed it  i said we'd make sure the auto industry came back strong  it's come back strong  you know what i believe  you know where i stand  and you know that no matter what happens  i'll fight for you and your family every single day  as hard as i know how   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  so when you're trying to compare the two candidates' agendas and we're talking about change  you know i know what real change looks like  because i've fought for it  because i've brought it  because i've got the scars to prove it  because i've gotten gray hair doing it  and after all we've been through together to bring about change  we can't give up on it now   i audience members i  no   i the president i  because there's more change to do  change is a country where every american has a shot at a good education  government can't do it alone  parents  you got to parent  students  you've got to study  but don't tell me that hiring more teachers won't help this economy grow  it will  don't tell me that students who can't afford college should just borrow more money from their parents   i audience members i  no   i the president i  that wasn't an option for me  i'll bet it's not an option for a lot of you  that's why the change i want to bring is to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next   years  make college more affordable  i want to recruit   new math and science teachers so we don't fall behind the rest of the world  i want to train   million americans at community colleges to get the skills that businesses are hiring for right now  that's my plan  that's what change is  that's the america we're fighting for in this election  change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation  i could not be prouder that i bet on american workers and american ingenuity when i bet on the american auto industry  but what i'm really proud of is not just that we're building cars in america again  but that we're building better cars because of advances  because of technology  because of innovation  cars that we're building now by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  that will save you money  it will help our national security  it will help our environment  and it's not just in the auto industry where we can make these kinds of strides  there are thousands of workers all across america  including here in florida  that are building long lasting batteries and wind turbines and solar panels  and i don't want a tax code that just subsidizes oil company profits  i want to subsidize and support the energy jobs of tomorrow  the new technologies that will cut our oil imports in half  and i don't want a tax code that rewards companies that ship jobs overseas  i want to reward companies that are investing here in america  hiring american workers  making things stamped with three proud words  made in america  that's my plan for jobs and growth  that's the future i see for this country  change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home  as long as i'm commander in chief  we will pursue our enemies with the strongest military the world has ever known  but it's time to use the savings from ending the wars to pay down our debt and rebuild america  rebuilding roads and bridges and making sure our schools are state of the art  and hiring our veterans when they come home  because if you fought for this country  you shouldn't have to fight for a job when you come home  that's my plan to keep america strong  that's what's at stake in this election  change is a future where we reduce our deficit in a way that's balanced and responsible  i've cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending  i intend to do more  but if we're serious about reducing the deficit  we've also got to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the tax rates they paid when bill clinton was president  because budgets are about choices  we can't do everything  and we got to make sure that what we do  we pay for  and i'm not going to turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  i'm not going to ask young people to pay more for college just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  so  florida  we know what change is  we know what the future requires  and we know it's not going to be easy  back in   we talked about change we can believe in  but i also said this is hard  because i wasn't just talking about changing presidents or changing parties  i was talking about changing how politics is done in this country  i ran the first time because the voices of the american people your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long by lobbyists and special interests and politicians who will say anything and do anything just to keep things the way they are  they want to protect the status quo  and for the last   years  the status quo in washington has fought us every step of the way  they spent millions to stop us from reforming the health care system  spent millions trying to stop us from reforming wall street  they engineered a strategy of gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise even on ideas that democrats and republicans used to support in the past  and what they're counting on now is that you'll be so worn down  so discouraged by all the squabbling  so tired of all the dysfunction that you'll just give up  walk away  and leave the powers that be in power   i audience members i  no   i the president i  in other words  their bet is on your cynicism  but  florida  my bet is on you and your hope  and listen  i want all parties to work together  we're not democrats and republicans first  we're americans first  and whenever the other party has been willing to work with me to help middle class families and to build sturdy ladders into the middle class  i've worked with them  some of them supported us when we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses  some courageous republican senators worked with us to repeal  don't ask  don't tell  as long as i'm president  i will work with anybody  of any party  to move this country forward  and if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders whether they're democrats  republicans  or independents who feel the same way  who put you first instead of politics first  instead of the next election first  but sometimes you got to fight for principle  sometimes you got to fight for what's right  if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals that will kick students off of financial aid or get rid of funding for planned parenthood or let insurance companies discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or eliminate health care for millions who are on medicaid people who are poor or elderly or disabled  i'm not willing to pay that price  that's not bipartisanship   i audience members i  no   i the president i  that's not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  that's surrender to the same status quo that has hurt the middle class and cost us jobs  and i don't know about you  but i'm not ready to give up on that fight   i audience members i  no   i the president i  and i hope you aren't either  florida   i audience members i  no   i the president i  i hope you still got some fight left in you   i audience members i  yeah  listen  the folks at the very top in this country  they don't need another champion in washington  they'll always have a seat at the table  and they'll always have access  they'll always have influence  the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night after i'm done in the office  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail like you every day  the laid off worker who has to go back and retrain at a community college at the age of   to try to get a new career in a new field  she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who cooks great food but needs a loan to expand after the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and the waiters and the cleaning staff  working overtime at a fort lauderdale hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kids to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who's back on the job  filled with pride and dignity  building a great car  he needs a champion  the teacher who's in an overcrowded classroom  maybe digging into her pocket to buy school supplies  not getting the support she needs  but showing up every day  knowing that maybe she's going to make that difference in that one child today  she needs a champion  the young immigrant who was brought here  pledged allegiance to our flag  understands themselves to be americans  they need a champion  all those kids in inner cities and small farm towns  in the valleys of ohio  the rolling virginia hills  the streets of hollywood  kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors  engineers or entrepreneurs  diplomats  businesspeople  even presidents  they need a champion in washington  because they don't have lobbyists  they don't make campaign contributions  but those kids  their dreams  that will be our saving grace  we've got to fight for them  and that's why i need you  florida  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we've come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint  it's time to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids  to train all our workers  to create new jobs  to discover new sources of energy  to broaden opportunity  to grow our middle class  to restore our democracy  to make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from  no matter how you started out  no matter what your last name is  no matter whether you're black or white or hispanic or asian or native american  young  old  rich  poor  disabled  not disabled  gay  straight it doesn't matter  if you work hard you can make it here in america too  that's what we're fighting for  that's why i'm asking for your vote  florida  and if you're willing to work with me and knock on some doors with me  make some phone calls for me  turn out for me  we're going to win florida  we'll win this election  we'll reaffirm the bonds that hold this country together  we'll reaffirm the spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  new hampshire  are you fired up  are you ready to go  you've got to be fired up after bill clinton  let me just say  president clinton has been traveling all across the country for this campaign  he has been breaking it down so well that people tell me i should ask him to be secretary of explaining stuff   i laughter i  the only clinton working harder than him is our secretary of state  hillary clinton  and i'm so grateful to both of them  i also want you to give it up for your outstanding governor john lynch and one of the best senators in washington  our friend  jeanne shaheen   i audience member i  we love you   i the president i  i love you back  now  this is an unbelievable crowd  i am so grateful to all of you  i know that some of you came here pretty early and it's getting a little cold  but folks from new hampshire are tough  they are tough  now  for the past several days  obviously  all of us have been focused on one of the worst storms of our lifetimes  and new hampshire knows about storms  but obviously  what we've seen happen in new jersey and new york and connecticut just breaks our heart  we can only imagine what families are going through who have lost loved ones in the storm  our hearts and prayers go out to them  and i had a chance to visit new jersey  and every day  i'm on the phone with our fema directors and the governors and the mayors and making sure that we're doing everything we can  and i think i speak for the entire country when i say we will not stop until those folks whose lives have been upended  that their lives have been rebuilt  we will be with them every step of the way  i don't speak just as the president  i speak for every single american  we're going to help them rebuild  we will help them rebuild  that's what we do as americans  and that's the interesting thing  is despite the heartbreak  we've also been inspired these past few days  and we see our first responders  our police officers  our firefighters  ems folks running into buildings  wading through water  helping their fellow citizens  we see neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy  leaders of different parties working to fix what's broken  a spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is  no matter how tough the times are  we're all in this together  we rise and fall as one nation and as one people  and that spirit  new hampshire  has guided this country along its improbable journey for more than two centuries  it's that spirit that carried us through the trials and tribulations of these last   years  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  the american auto industry is back on top  home values are on the rise  we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in   years  because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform a whole lot of them from here in new hampshire the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is coming to a close  al qaida is on the run  usama bin laden is dead  we've made real progress  we've made real progress these past   years  but  new hampshire  we're here because we know we've got more work to do  as long as there is a single american who wants a job  but can't find one  our work is not yet done  as long as there are families who are working harder and harder  but still falling behind  our work is not yet done  as long as there is a child anywhere in new hampshire  anywhere in this country  who is languishing in poverty and barred from opportunity  our fight has to go on  our fight has to go on  our fight goes on because we know this nation can't succeed without a growing  thriving middle class  our fight goes on because america has always done best when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why you elected bill clinton in '  that's why you elected me in   and that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i the president i  now  new hampshire   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  new hampshire  in   days  you're all going to have a choice to make  and it's not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  it's a choice between two different visions for america  between a return to the top down policies that crashed our economy and an economy that's built from the middle out and the bottom up and creates a strong  growing middle class  as americans  we honor the strivers  the dreamers  the small businesspeople  the entrepreneurs  the risk takers  they've always been the driving force behind our free enterprise system  and that system has been the greatest engine of growth and prosperity the world has ever known  but we also know that in this country  that system  our free enterprise system  works when everybody has got a shot  when everybody is participating  when everybody has got a chance to get a good education and learn new skills  when we support research into medical breakthroughs and new technologies that will create new businesses  we believe america is stronger when everybody can count on affordable health care  when everybody can count on medicare and social security for a dignified retirement  we think the market works better when there are rules  when there are rules in place to protect our kids from toxic dumping  rules in place to protect consumers from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous credit card companies or mortgage lenders  and you know  folks in new hampshire  just like folks all across the country  they don't want to do they don't want to see government do everything  they want to make sure government is giving people tools to succeed  and there are some things they don't want government meddling in  for example  they certainly don't want politicians in washington most of whom are male trying to control health care choices that women should be making for themselves  now  for   years  we had a president who shared these beliefs  you just heard him  president clinton's economic plan asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more so we could reduce our deficit and invest in the skills and ideas of our people  and at the time  the republican congress and a certain senate candidate by the name of mitt romney said bill clinton's plan would hurt the economy and kill jobs  sounds familiar  doesn't it  turns out  his math was just as bad back then as it is now   i laughter i  because by the end of president clinton's second term  america created   million new jobs  and incomes were up  and poverty was down  and the deficit had become the biggest surplus in history  so  new hampshire  we know our ideas work  we've tried them  and they worked  they worked for middle class families  they created strong and sturdy ladders into the middle class for everybody who was willing to carry out their responsibilities  now  just like we've tried our ideas  the other side  they've tried their ideas  we gave those a shot  after bill clinton left  we had   years to test their ideas  to test governor romney's ideas  for most of the last decade  we tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans  we tried letting insurance companies and oil companies  wall street  do whatever they pleased  giving them free license  and what did we get  falling incomes  record deficits  the slowest job growth in half a century  and an economic crisis that we've been cleaning up after ever since  so let me get this straight  we tried our ideas  they worked  middle class grew  america prospered  deficits became surpluses  we tried their ideas  incomes went down  deficit blew up  massive financial crisis we're still cleaning up  now  this poses a dilemma for governor romney  but he's a very talented salesman  and in this campaign  he has tried as hard as he can to repackage the same old ideas and pretend they're new  in fact  he's offering them up as change  says he's the candidate of change  now  let me just say this  we know what change looks like  and what he's selling ain't it  it ain't it  giving more power back to the biggest banks  that's not change  another   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  refusing to answer questions about the details of your policies until after the election is over  that's definitely not change   i laughter i  that's the oldest trick in the book  ruling out compromise  pledging to rubberstamp the tea party's agenda in congress not change  changing the facts when they're inconvenient to your campaign  that's not change  at least not the kind of change you want out of your president  new hampshire  after   years as president  you know me  part of this election is not just about policy  it's also about who do you trust  the fact is what you know about me is i mean what i say and i say what i mean  i said i'd end the war in iraq  i ended it  i said i'd pass health care reform  i passed it  i said i'd repeal  don't ask  don't tell we repealed it  i said i'd expand opportunity for young people to go to college  that's exactly what we did  you may not agree with every policy i've put forward  there have been times where by the way  michelle doesn't agree with everything i do   i laughter i  you may be frustrated sometimes with the pace of change  i'm frustrated too sometimes  but you know where i stand  you know what i believe  you know i tell the truth  and you know that i will fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  as long as i've got the privilege to be your president  so when you ask yourself the question  who is going to fight for me and bring about real change  you know that i know what real change looks like  because i fought for it alongside you  i've got the scars to prove it  i've got the gray hair to show for it  after all we've been through together  we can't give up now   i audience members i  no   i the president i  so let me tell you the change we need for the next four years  change is a country where every american has a shot at a good education  government can't do it alone  parents have to parent  students  you have to study  but don't tell me hiring more quality teachers won't help this economy grow  don't tell me that students who can't afford college should just borrow money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me or bill clinton or michelle or a whole bunch of you  that's why i want to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next   years  that's why i want to recruit   new math and science teachers so our country doesn't fall behind  i want to train   million americans in our community colleges with the skills that businesses are hiring for right now  that's what change is  that's what we're fighting for in this election  that's how we'll grow our economy  change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation  i couldn't be prouder that i bet on american workers and american ingenuity and the american auto industry  but what makes me really proud is  we're not just building cars again  we're building better cars  cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  but we don't have to just stop with cars  we america has always been about innovation  advanced manufacturing  making stuff  there are thousands of workers around the country right now building long lasting batteries and wind turbines  i want to make sure that we're supporting the industries and manufacturing of the future  i don't want a tax code that subsidizes oil company profits when they're making money hand over fist  i want to support the energy jobs of tomorrow  i want to support the new technologies that will help us cut our oil imports in half  i don't want a tax code rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas  i want to reward companies that will create the next generation of manufacturing right here in concord  right here in new hampshire  right here in the united states  that's change  that's the future i see for this country  change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home  now  as long as i'm commander in chief  we will pursue our enemies relentlessly with the strongest military the world has ever known  but it's time to use some of the savings from ending the wars in iraq and winding down the war in afghanistan to pay down our debt  rebuild america  we could  right now  put workers back to work repairing roads and bridges  making sure our schools are state of the art  laying broadband lines into rural communities  and we can hire our veterans when they come home  because if you fought for freedom  if you fought for this country  you shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over your heads when you come home  that's how we keep america strong  that's what's at stake in this election  change is reducing our deficit in a balanced  responsible way  you know  a lot of folks talk about deficit reduction as a political tool  but when it when it comes down to it  we've got to make choices  we've got to make choices  these priorities reflect our values  i've cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending that we didn't need  and i'm willing to do more  but just as we did when bill clinton was president  we've got to ask the wealthiest to pay a little bit more so we can reduce the deficit and still invest in the things we need to grow  i will not turn medicare into a voucher just to give millionaires another tax cut  i'm not going to make college more expensive for young people just to give me a tax cut  i don't need it  i don't want it  because i believe america will be stronger if we're helping the next generation succeed  so  new hampshire  that's what change is  we know what the future requires  and we know it won't be easy  you know  back in   i spent a lot of time here in new hampshire  i know you guys  you saw a lot of me   i laughter i  and back then  we talked about change we can believe in  but i said to people  you know  i'm not just talking about changing parties or changing presidents  i'm talking about changing how our politics works  i ran because the voices of the american people your voices all of you  folks way in the back and folks here in the front your voices have been shut out of our democracy for way too long  by lobbyists and special interests and politicians who were willing to say anything and do anything just to keep things the way they are  the protectors of the status quo  and for the last   years  those protectors of the status quo  they have fought us fiercely every step of the way  they spent millions to try to stop us from reforming the health care system  spent millions trying to stop us from reforming wall street  they engineered a strategy of gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise on ideas that traditionally both democrats and republicans had supported  and what they're counting on now is that you're going to be so worn down by the squabbling and the dysfunction and the arguing and the bickering that you're just going to give up  walk away  and   i audience members i  no   i the president   i and leave things the way they are   i audience members i  no   i the president   i leave folks who have the power right where they are  in other words  their bet is on cynicism  but  new hampshire  my bet is on you  my bet is on you  and by the way  when i talk about fighting for what we care about  this isn't a partisan fight  when the other party has been willing to work with me to help middle class families  i am right there with them  i love that  when we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses  we got republican help  when we came together to repeal  don't ask  don't tell  we had some courageous republican senators who supported it  as long as i'm president  i will work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  and if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders who feel the same way whether they're democrats or republicans or independents folks like john lynch  folks like jeanne shaheen  you'll vote for candidates like annie kuster  carol shea porter  you'll make maggie hassan the next governor of new hampshire  because they're focused on you  not on politics in the next election  and your governor sets a great example of that  but you've also got to have principles  you got to have something you stand for  and if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals to kick students off of financial aid or get rid of funding for planned parenthood or let insurance companies go back to discriminating against people with preexisting conditions or eliminate millions of people on medicaid who rely on it for their health care the poor  the disabled  the elderly that's not a deal i'm willing to take  that's not a price i'm willing to pay  that's not bipartisanship  and it's certainly not change  that is surrender to the same status quo that has squeezed middle class families for way too long  and  new hampshire  i'm here today because i'm not ready to give up on the fight  i know i look a little older  but i got a lot of fight left in me  i am not ready to give up on the fight  and i hope you aren't either  new hampshire  i hope you aren't  either  you know  the folks at the very top of this country  they don't need a champion in washington  they'll always have a seat at the table  they'll always have access and influence  that's the way things work  we understand that  the people who really need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night after i come up from the oval office  the men and women that i meet on the campaign trail  the laid off paper mill worker who's retraining at the age of   for a new career in a new industry  she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who's got great food  but needs a loan to expand and the bank has turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and the waiters and the cleaning staff working overtime at a vegas hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who got laid off  thought the plant was going to close  and then got called back  and now is filled with pride and dignity  building a great car  he needs a champion  that teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated textbooks  digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies and not always getting the support that she needs  but knowing every day she might reach that one child and make all the difference in that child's life  she needs a champion  all those kids in inner cities and small farm towns  in the valleys of ohio  the rolling virginia hills  the streets of concord  kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors or engineers or entrepreneurs or businesspeople or teachers or diplomats or even a president  they need a champion in washington  they don't have lobbyists  the future never has as many lobbyists as the vested interests in the status quo  but it's the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace  it's their dreams that will be the foundation of america  and that's why i need you  new hampshire  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we have come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint  it's time to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids and all our workers  create new jobs and rebuild our roads and our bridges and discover new sources of energy  to broaden opportunity  to grow our middle class  to restore our democracy  and to make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from or how you started out  you can make it here in america  and  new hampshire  that's why i'm asking you for your vote  last night i was down in virginia  we had a huge rally  and we were talking to our staff and our field organizers  they're all   or  i laughter i and we were talking to them  and i said  well  how are things looking  and they seemed pretty confident  and i looked at david plouffe some of you know he's my big campaign pooh bah  smart guy but plouffe and i looked at each other  and we said  you know what  we're no longer relevant now  we're props  because what's happened is now the campaign falls on these  year old kids who are out there knocking on doors and making phone calls  and then we realized  pretty soon  after they do their jobs  then they're not relevant either  because it's now up to you  that's how our democracy works  right  that ultimately it's up to you  you have the power  you will be shaping the decisions for this country for decades to come right now in the next   days  and if you're willing to work with me  if you're willing to stand with me  if you're willing to knock on some doors with me  if you're willing to make some phone calls with me  if you're willing to turn out for me  we'll win new hampshire  we'll win this election  we'll finish what we started  we'll renew those bonds that do not break and reaffirm the spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  let's go get it  new hampshire  thank you  god bless you  god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  iowa  tomorrow  tomorrow  iowa  tomorrow  from the granite of new hampshire to the rockies of colorado  from the coastlines of florida to virginia's rolling hills  from the valleys of ohio to these iowa fields  we will keep america moving forward  i've come back to iowa one more time to ask for your vote  i came back to ask you to help us finish what we've started  because this is where our movement for change began  right here  right here  right behind these bleachers is the building that was home to our iowa headquarters in   i was just inside  and it brought back a whole lot of memories  this was where some of the first young people who joined our campaign set up shop  willing to work for little pay and less sleep because they believed that people who love their country can change it  this was where so many of you who shared that belief came to help  when the heat didn't work for the first week or so i laughter i some of you brought hats and gloves for the staff  these poor kids  they weren't prepared   i laughter i  when the walls inside were bare  one of you painted a mural to lift everybody's spirits  when we had a steak fry to march to  when we had a j j dinner to fire up  you brought your neighbors and you made homemade signs  when we had calls to make  teachers and nurses showed up after work  already bone tired  but staying anyway  late into the night  and you welcomed me and michelle into your homes  and you picked us up when we needed a lift  and your faces gave me new hope for this country's future  and your stories filled me with resolve to fight for you every single day i set foot in the oval office  you inspired us  i want to take this opportunity to say one thing to all the young people and not so young people who've given so much to this campaign over the years  those of you who haven't done this just for me  but for each other for a laid off family member  for a sick child  for a fallen friend to all of you who've lived and breathed the hard work of change  i want to thank you  you took this campaign and you made it your own  and you organized yourselves  block by block  neighborhood by neighborhood  county by county  starting a movement that spread across the country  a movement made up of young and old  and rich and poor  and black and white  latino  asian  native american  gay  straight  democrats  republicans  who believe we've all got something to contribute  that we all deserve a shot at our own american dream  and when the cynics said we couldn't  you said   yes  we can   i audience members i  yes we can   i the president i  you said   yes  we can  and we did  against all odds  we did  we didn't know what challenges would come when we began this journey  we didn't know how deep the crisis would turn out  but we knew we would get through those challenges the same way this nation always has  with that determined  unconquerable american spirit that says no matter how bad the storm gets  no matter how tough times are  we're all in this together  we rise or fall as one nation and as one people  that's the spirit that's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last   years  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  and today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  the american auto industry is back  home values are on the rise  we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last   years  we've doubled the production of clean energy  because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is ending  al qaida is on the run  usama bin laden is dead  we've made real progress these past   years  but  iowa  we're here tonight because we've got more work to do  we're not done yet on this journey  we've got more road to travel  as long as there's a single american who wants a job but can't find one  as long as there are families working harder but still falling behind  as long as there's a child anywhere in des moines  anywhere in iowa  anywhere in this country languishing in poverty  barred from opportunity  our work isn't done  our fight for change goes on  because we know this nation cannot succeed without a growing  thriving middle class and sturdy ladders for everybody who's willing to work to get into that middle class  our fight goes on because america's always done best when everybody's got a fair shot and everybody's doing their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules  the people of iowa understand that  that's what we believe  that's why you elected me in   and  iowa  that's why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  the choice you make tomorrow and you understand this  iowans  you guys pay attention i laughter i the choice you make is not just between two candidates or parties  it's a choice between two different visions of america  who we are  what we believe  what we care about  it's a choice between going back to the top down policies that caused the mess we've been fighting our way out of for   years  or moving forward to a future that's built on a strong and growing middle class  and  iowa  you know me as well as anybody  you've seen a lot of me these last   years   i laughter i  and you know what  you may not agree with every decision i've made  michelle doesn't   i laughter i  there may be times where you've been frustrated at the pace of change  i promise you  so have i  but i tell you what  you know what i believe  you know where i stand  you know i tell the truth  you know i'll fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  and that's why  when we talk about change  we know what real change looks like because we've fought for it  we've got the scars to prove it  i've got the gray hair to show it   i laughter i  i wasn't this gray when i first showed up in iowa  and sometimes it's been hard  sometimes it's been frustrating  we understand that  but what we also know is that when we decide to make a difference  when americans come together  determined to bring about change  nobody can stop us  we cannot be stopped  and after all we've been through together  after all that we fought through together  we cannot give up on change now  we know what real change looks like  change is a country where every american has a shot at a great education  where we recruit new teachers  train new workers  bring down tuition so that no one in this country is forced to give up the dream of a college education  change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation by investing in the next generation of technology and manufacturing  instead of subsidizing oil company profits  i want to support energy jobs of tomorrow  and iowa knows about clean energy and biodiesel and wind turbines that will free this country from the grip of foreign oil  i don't want a tax code that rewards companies for creating jobs overseas  i want to reward companies that create jobs right here in america  that's what change is  iowa  change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home  repairing our roads and our bridges  making our schools state of the art  putting our veterans back to work  because nobody who fights for this country's freedom should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home  that's what we're fighting for  that's why we're not done  change is a future where we reduce our deficit by asking the wealthiest americans to go back to the tax rates they paid when bill clinton was in office  we'll cut out spending we don't need  but as long as i'm president  we're not going to turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  we're not going to kick a kid off of head start just to pay for a millionaire's tax cut  because our budget reflects our priorities and our values  and we know what our future requires  we know what real change is  you've you helped teach me that  here in iowa  and what you also know is  is that change isn't easy  remember  a lot of you showed up to town hall meetings back in     and i used to talk about change  but i also said i'm not just talking about changing presidents  i'm not just talking about changing parties  i'm talking about changing our politics  i told you i ran because your voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long by special interests and politicians who will do whatever it takes to keep things just the way they are  and we've seen over the last   years  the status quo in washington  they are powerful and they have fought us every step of the way  when we tried and succeeded in reforming our health care system  they spent millions trying to stop us  when we tried and succeeded in reforming wall street  they spent millions to push us back  and we kept on going  but those were tough fights  and what the protectors of the status quo in washington are counting on now is that you'll get worn down by all the squabbling  you'll get fed up with the dysfunction  you'll give up on the change we've fought for  you'll walk away and leave them to make decisions that affect every american  in other words  their bet is on cynicism  but  iowa  you taught me to bet on you  you taught me to bet on hope  i'll work with anybody  of any party  to move this country forward  and if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders who say who feel the same way  whether they're democrats or republicans or independents  the kind of iowa leaders you've always had  tom and christie vilsack and tom harkin and leonard boswell and bruce braley and my great friends tom miller and mike fitzgerald  but there are some principles you got to fight for  there are times where you've got to take a stand  if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals to kick students off of financial aid or get rid of funding for planned parenthood or let insurance companies discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions or eliminate health care for millions on medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled  i won't pay that price  that's not a deal i will make  that's not bipartisanship  that's not change  that's surrender to the same forces of the status quo that has squeezed middle class families for way too long  and  iowa  i'm not ready to give up on the fight  i've got a lot more fight left in me  but to wage that fight on behalf of american families  i need you to still have some fight in you too  the folks at the top in this country  turns out they don't need another champion in washington  they'll always have a seat at the table  they'll always have access and influence  the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night after a long day in the office  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day  the laid off furniture worker who's retraining at the age of   for a new career at a community college  she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who needs a loan to expand he's got great food but the bank turned him down he needs help  he needs a champion  the cooks and the waiters and cleaning staff  working overtime in a hotel in des moines or vegas  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who was laid off  thought the plant would never reopen  and is now back on the job  filled with pride and dignity  building a great car  building america  he needs a champion  the teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated schoolbooks  digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies  not always feeling like she's got the support she needs  but showing up every day because she knows that this might be the day that she's got a breakthrough and she makes a difference in one child's life  she needs a champion  all those kids in inner cities  small farm towns  kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors  engineers or entrepreneurs  diplomats or even a president  they need a champion in washington  because the future will never have as many lobbyists as the status quo  children don't have lobbyists the way oil companies or banks do  but it's the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace  that's what we fight for  that's why i need you  iowa  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  and that's why we've come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint  now is the time to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids and train all our workers and to create new jobs and rebuild our roads and bring back our troops and care for our veterans and broaden opportunity and grow our middle class and restore our democracy and make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from or how you started out  what you look like  who you love  what your last name is  here in america  you can make it if you try  that's what we're fighting for  and  iowa  after all the months of campaigning  after all the rallies  after the millions of dollars of ads  it all comes down to you  it's out of my hands now  it's in yours  all of it depends on what you do when you step into that voting booth tomorrow  it's just a remarkable thing  the way our democracy works  and at a certain point  all this effort and all these campaign rallies  and then it just comes down to each of us  as citizens  all of it depends on you bringing your friend or your neighbor  your coworker  your mom  your dad  your wife  your husband to the polls  that's how our democracy is supposed to be  the single most powerful force in our democracy is you  moving this country forward begins with you  don't ever let anybody tell you your vote doesn't matter  don't let anybody tell you your voice can't make a difference  it makes a difference  i got a powerful reminder of this myself on our last campaign  folks in iowa  i know you may have heard this story  but it was early in the primaries  and we were still way down in the polls  and i think this just this office had just finally gotten the heat turned on   i laughter i  and at the time  i was still competing in south carolina  it was one of the early primary states  and i really wanted the endorsement of a state representative down there  i'd met her at some function where i was nobody knew me  nobody could pronounce my name  they're wondering  what's he thinking   i laughter i  so i asked her for her endorsement  and she said   i tell you what  obama  i will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of greenwood  south carolina  and i think i had a little bit of wine during dinner  because right away i said   okay   i laughter i  so it's about a month later  and i'm traveling back to south carolina  and we flew in late at night  i think we were coming from iowa  we had been campaigning nonstop  traveling all through towns and having town hall meetings and shaking hands  and i'm in between  i'm making phone calls  asking people for support  and so we land in greenville  south carolina  at around midnight  we get to the hotel about   o'clock in the morning  i am wiped out  i'm exhausted  and i'm dragging my bags to my room  back then we didn't fly on air force one  and i laughter i the accommodations were a little different   i laughter i  and just as i'm about to walk into the room  one of my staff taps me on the shoulder  and they say   excuse me  senator i was a senator back then   we're going to have to wake up and be on the road at   in the morning  and i said   what   i laughter i   why   well  you made this promise to go to greenwood  and it's several hours away   i laughter i  and you know  iowa  i try to keep my promises  so a few hours later  i wake up  and i'm feeling terrible  i think a cold's coming on  and i open up the curtains to try to get some light to wake me up  but it's pouring down rain  terrible storm  and i take a shower and get some coffee  and i open up the newspaper and there's a bad story about me in the new york times   i laughter i  i was much more sensitive at that time to bad stories   i laughter i  i've become more accustomed to these now  and finally  i get dressed  i go downstairs  and i'm walking out to the car  and my umbrella blows open  and i'm soaked  so by the time i'm in the car  i'm wet and i'm mad and i'm still kind of sleepy  and it turns out that greenwood is several hours away from everyplace else   i laughter i  so we drive and we drive and we drive and we drive  and finally we get to greenwood  although you don't know you're in greenwood right away because there are not a lot of tall buildings around  and we pull up to a small field house  and i walk in  and i'm looking around  i don't hear a lot going on  and the state representative said she was going to organize a little meeting for us  and we walk in  and there are about   people there  and they're all kind of wet too  and they don't look very excited to see me   i laughter i  but i'm running for president  so i do what i'm supposed to do  and i'm shaking hands  i say   how do you do  nice to meet you  and i'm making my way around the room  and suddenly i hear this voice cry out behind me   fired up   i audience members i  ready to go   i the president i  and i'm startled  and i don't know what's going on  but everybody in the room this is a small room they act like this is normal   i laughter i  and when the voice says   fired up  they all say   ready to go  and so once again  i hear the voice   fired up  they say   fired up  they say   ready to go   ready to go  i look around  i turn behind me  there's this small woman  she's about   years old  looks like she just came from church  she got a big church hat   i laughter i  and she's looking at me  kind of peering at me  and she's grinning  smiling  looking happy  turns out she's a city councilwoman from greenwood who also moonlights as a private detective  i'm not making this up   i laughter i  this is true  and it turns out she's famous throughout the area  when she goes to football games and when she goes to rallies and she goes to community events  she does this chant of hers  she does it wherever she goes  so for the next few minutes  she just keeps on saying   fired up   i audience members i  ready to go   i the president i  and everybody says   fired up  and she says   ready to go  and everybody says   ready to go  and i'm thinking  this woman is showing me up   i laughter i  this is my meeting  i'm running for president   i laughter i  and she's dominating the room  and i look at my staff  and they just shrug their shoulders  they don't know what to do  so this goes on for a few minutes  now  here's the thing  iowa  after a few minutes  i'm feeling kind of fired up   i laughter i  i'm feeling like i'm ready to go   i laughter i  so i start joining in the chant  and my staff starts joining in the chant  and suddenly  i feel pretty good  and we go on to talk about the lives of the people in the room and their families and their struggles and their hopes for their kids and their grandkids  and we drive out  and it's still raining  but it doesn't seem so bad  and we go to our next stop  and for the rest of the day  even after we left greenwood  even though we still weren't getting any big crowds anyplace  even though people still couldn't pronounce my name  i felt good   i laughter i  and i'd see my staff  and i'd say   are you fired up  they'd say   we're fired up  i'd say   are you ready to go  and they'd say   we're ready to go  and we brought that to iowa  and during our rallies  this became a chant  and we'd have signs saying   fired up  ready to go  and the woman her name was edith childs she became a celebrity  and she was written up in the wall street journal i laughter i and folks did news stories on her  and this became one of the anthems of our campaign back in   now  here's the end of the story  though  we knew we were coming back to des moines for the last campaign rally i'll ever do for me  and so we were getting kind of sentimental  and we called up edith childs  and we said  why don't you come on up   i applause i  no  no  no  listen to this  we said  why don't you come on up  we'll fly you up from south carolina  and you can do this chant one more time  just for old  good times' sake  it's like getting the band back together again  we're i laughter i  and you know what edith said  she said   i'd love to see you  but i think we can still win north carolina  so i'm taking a crew into north carolina to knock on doors on election day  i don't have time just to be talking about it  i've got to knock on some doors  i've got to turn out the vote  i'm still fired up  but i've got work to do  and that shows you what one voice can do  one voice can change a room  and if it can change a room  it can change a city  and if it can change a city  it can change a state  and if it can change a state  it can change a nation  and if it can change a nation  it can change the world  and  iowa  in   your voice changed the world  and edith childs asked me to ask you that if you're willing to still stand with me tomorrow  if you're willing to get your friends and your neighbors and your coworkers to the polls tomorrow  if you're willing to make sure we finish what we started  she's pretty sure we'll win iowa  she's pretty sure we'll win this election  and she just had one question for you  and that is  are you fired up   i audience members i  ready to go   i the president i  are you fired up   i audience members i  ready to go   i the president i  are you fired up   i audience members i  ready to go   i the president i  are you fired up   i audience members i  ready to go   i the president i  iowa  tomorrow let's remind the world just why it is the united states of america is the greatest nation on earth  i love you  let's go vote  let's keep moving forward  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  columbus  hello  ohio  are you fired up   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  are you ready to go   i audience members i  yes   i the president i  fired up   i audience members i  fired up   i the president i  ready to go   i audience members i  ready to go   i the president i  fired up   i audience members i  fired up   i the president i  ready to go   i audience members i  ready to go   i the president i  give it up for jay z  it is an incredible honor to have jay z and bruce springsteen on the same bill  and not only are they all on my ipod and yes  the president has an ipod i laughter i but it's also because both of them tell an american story  now  jay z   i audience member i  i love you  obama   i the president i  i love you back  i told jay z the other day our lives are parallel a little bit  nobody  i think  would expect us to be where we are today when they met us as younger men  both of us now have daughters  and both of us have wives who are more popular than we are   i laughter i  and bruce springsteen  all the work he's done for this campaign  the boss  he  just like jay  they tell the story of what our country is  but also what it should be and what it can be and what we need to fight for  and i'm going to be flying with bruce springsteen on the last day that i'll ever campaign  that's not a bad way to bring it home  with the boss   i applause i  with the boss  there are a few other people i want to thank before we get started  one of the toughest fighters on behalf of working families that i know  your senator  sherrod brown is in the house  someone who will follow in his footsteps if you send her to congress  joyce beatty is here  your mayor  michael coleman  is here  and give it up for your former governor and my friend  ted stickland in the house  now  for the past week  all of us have been focused on what's been happening on the east coast and one of the worst storms of our lifetime  and as a nation  we watch the harrowing images  and we've been heartbroken by those who have been lost  and i had a chance to visit new jersey and talk to some of the families  and every day  i'm on the phone with mayors and local officials  and what i've said to them and i think  ohio  you'll agree with me when i say this  because i didn't just speak for me  i spoke for the country is that we will be with them every step of the way on the hard road to recovery  every step of the way  because that's what we do as americans  we will help them rebuild and we'll carry on with the spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is  no matter how tough times may get  we're all in this together  we rise or fall as one nation and as one people  that spirit has guided this country along its improbable journey for more than two centuries  it's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last   years  now  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  the american auto industry has come roaring back  home values are on the rise  we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last   years  because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is ending  al qaida is on the path to defeat  usama bin laden is dead  we've made progress these last   years  we've made real progress  ohio  but the reason why we're here is because we've got more work to do  our work is not yet done  as long as there is a single american who wants a job and can't find one  our work is not yet done  as long as there are families anywhere in ohio  anywhere in the country  working harder  but falling behind  we're not finished  as long as there's a child anywhere in this country who's languishing in poverty and barred from opportunity  our fight goes on  our fight goes on  ohio  because this nation cannot succeed without a growing  thriving middle class and roads and paths of opportunity for everybody who is willing to work hard to get into the middle class  our fight goes on because america always does best when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why you elected me in   and that's why i'm running for a second term for president of the united states  now  ohio  tomorrow you've got a choice to make  although some of you have already made the choice  how many have early voted around here  this is not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  it's a choice between two different visions of america  it's a choice between a return to the top down economic policies that crashed our economy or a vision that says we've got to build a strong foundation based on a strong and growing middle class and opportunity for everybody  not just some  as americans  we honor the strivers and the dreamers and the risk takers  the businesspeople  the free enterprise system  the greatest engine of growth and prosperity the world has ever known  that's what we believe in  but we also know that our system  our economy works best when everybody is participating  not just some  when everybody has a chance to get a great education  when everybody has a chance to learn the skills they need to compete  our economy does best when we invest in the common enterprise of basic research to create new technologies and new industries and new jobs  we believe america is stronger when everybody can count on affordable health insurance  when everybody can count on medicare and social security in their golden years  we think our markets work best  our economy works best when there are some rules in place to protect our kids from toxic dumping and pollution  to protect consumers from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous credit card companies or mortgage lenders  and we also believe  by the way  there are some things washington should not do  for example  we don't need a bunch of politicians trying to control health care decisions that women are perfectly capable of making themselves  now  for   years  we had a president who shared these beliefs  his name was bill clinton  and it's interesting when he first came into office  his economic plan asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little more so we could reduce our deficit and invest in the skills and ideas of our people  and at the time  the republican congress and a certain senate candidate by the name of mitt romney   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  don't boo  vote   i applause i  vote  you don't need to boo  folks can't hear you boo  but they can hear you vote  so anyway  this candidate  mr  romney  along with the republican congress  they all said  bill clinton's plan is terrible  it will hurt the economy  it's going to kill jobs  turns out  their math was just as bad then as it is now  because by the end of bill clinton's second term  america created   million new jobs  and incomes were up  and poverty was down  and our deficit had become a surplus  so we've tried our ideas  and they worked  now  how about the other guys ideas  we tried those too  after bill clinton left office  the republicans had a chance to try their ideas out  and we tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans  we tried giving insurance companies and oil companies and wall street a free license  do whatever you please  and we got falling incomes and record deficits and the slowest job growth in half a century  and it culminated in the worst financial crisis that we've ever seen in our lifetimes  so we've tried our ideas  and they work  we've tried their ideas  and they don't work  and this means this should be a pretty easy choice  but you got to give him credit  governor romney is a very talented salesman  and so in this campaign  he's tried to repackage the old ideas that don't work and offer them up as change  he's tried to pretend that somehow these old ideas that did not work are new and will work this time  but here's the thing  ohio  we know what change looks like  and what he's selling ain't it  giving more power to the biggest banks is not change  another   trillion tax cut favoring the wealthy  not change  refusing to answer questions about the details of your policies until after the election  that's definitely not change  that's an old trick  ruling out compromise by pledging to rubberstamp the tea party's agenda in congress  not change  changing the facts when they're inconvenient to your campaign  that's definitely not change  now  that's why when you're making this choice  ohio  you have to remember that this isn't just about policy  it's also about trust  ohio  after   years  you know me by now   i applause i  you know me  you may not agree with every single decision i've made  that's okay  because michelle doesn't either   i laughter i  you may be frustrated some times at the pace of change  i promise you  so am i  but you know that i mean what i say and i say what i mean  i said i'd end the war in iraq  i ended it  i said i'd repeal  don't ask  don't tell  i repealed it  i said we'd pass health care reform  we passed it  i said we'd save an auto industry  we saved it  i do what i say  you know what i believe  you know where i stand  you know i tell the truth  and you know i will fight for you and your family every single day as hard as i know how   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  you know that i know what real change looks like because you've seen me fight for it  i've got the scars to prove it  i've got the gray hair to prove it  and you've had my back in that fight  and after all we've been through together  we can't give up on it now  we've got more work to do  we know what change we're going to be delivering over the next   years  a country where every american has a shot at a great education  let me tell you  government can't do it all  parents have to parent  students  you have to study  but don't tell me hiring more teachers will not help this economy grow  it will  don't tell me students who can't afford college should just borrow money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me  i'll bet it's not an option for a lot of you  and that's why i want to cut the growth of tuition so our young people aren't burdened with debt  i want to recruit   math and science teachers so our kids don't fall behind  i want to train   million americans at our community colleges with the skills that businesses are looking for right now  that's what real change is  that's what's at stake in this election  that's what we're fighting for  change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation  i'm proud we saved the auto industry  but i'm even prouder that we're making better cars now than we used to  by the middle of the next decade  american cars will be getting going twice as far on a gallon of gas  that will save you money  it will help the environment  it will help cut our oil imports  and we can't just stop at oil or we can't just stop at cars  we've got thousands of workers here in ohio and across the country building long lasting batteries  building wind turbines  i don't want to subsidize oil company profits  i want to support new energy the energy of tomorrow that will cut our oil imports in half  i don't want a tax code that rewards companies for creating jobs overseas  i want to fight with sherrod brown to make sure that we are delivering those tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in ohio  right here in the united states  hiring american workers  that's what we're fighting for  that's the future i see for this country  change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home  as long as i'm commander in chief  i will pursue our enemies with the strongest military the world has ever known  but it's time to use the savings from ending the war in iraq  from transitioning out of afghanistan  to pay down our debt  rebuild america  put people back to work repairing roads  making our schools state of the art  hiring our veterans  because if you fought for this country  you shouldn't have to fight for a job when you come home  that's my commitment  that's what's at stake in this election  change is a future where we have to reduce our deficit  but do it in a balanced way  and i've signed a trillion dollars' worth of spending cuts  i intend to do more  but if we're serious about reducing the deficit  we've got to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the tax rates they paid when bill clinton was in office  because  listen  a budget is about priorities  it's about values  and i'm not going to kick some kid off of head start so i can get a tax break  i'm not going to turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  that's not who we are  we know what real change is  we know what the future requires  and we also know it won't be easy  and that's because when i talked about change back in   i wasn't just talking about changing presidents or changing parties  i was talking about changing our politics  i ran because the voices of the american people your voices you voices had been shut out of our democracy for way too long  by lobbyists and special interests and politicians who will say anything or do anything to protect things just the way they are  over the last   years  the status quo in washington has fought us every step of the way  spent millions to try to stop us from reforming health care  spent millions trying to stop us from reforming wall street  they engineered a strategy of gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise on ideas that it used to be democrats and republicans supported in the past  and what they're counting on now is that you're going to be so fed up  so worn down by all the arguing  so tired of all the dysfunction that you'll just give up  you'll walk away   i audience members i  boo   i the president i  you'll let them go ahead and make all the decisions  in other words  their bet's on cynicism  ohio  my bet is on you  my hope is with you  my fight is for you  and that is not a partisan statement  when the other party has been willing to work with me to help middle class families and working families  i love to work with them  they helped cut middle class taxes and small business taxes  we came together  we had republicans who helped us repeal  don't ask  don't tell  i respect that  i will work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  and if you want to end the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders like sherrod brown and joyce beatty who will put americans first  not elections first  but you know what we can't do is give up on our principles  there are some things that we do have to fight for  there are some things that we've got to fight for  we've got to make sure that if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals that are going to kick students off of financial aid or get rid of funding for planned parenthood or let insurance companies discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or eliminate health care for millions on medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled  that's not a price i'm willing to pay  that's not bipartisanship  that is not change  that's surrender to the same status quo that's hurt middle class families for way too long  and  ohio  i'm not ready to give up on the fight  i've got a whole lot of fight left in me  and i hope you do too   i applause i  i hope you do too  the folks at the very top in this country  they don't need another champion in washington  they'll always have a seat at the table  they'll always have access and influence  that's the way things are  we understand that  the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day  the laid off worker who is having to go back and retrain at the age of   at a community college  she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who has got some great food  but needs a loan to expand after the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and waiters and cleaning staff working overtime at a columbus hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kids to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who is back on the job  filled with pride and dignity of building a great car  he needs a champion  the teacher in an overcrowded classroom  having to dig into her own pocket to buy school supplies  but shows up every day believing in those students  she needs a champion  all those kids in inner cities and small farm towns  in these ohio valleys or the rolling hills of virginia  somewhere in jersey  somewhere in brooklyn  maybe even a kid in hawaii kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors  engineers or entrepreneurs  diplomats or musicians  maybe even a president they need a champion in washington  because the future is what we're fighting for  the future never has lobbyists like the status quo does  but the dreams of those children will be our saving grace  that's why i need you  ohio  to make sure their voices are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we've come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint  now is the time to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids  to train all our workers  to create new jobs  rebuild our infrastructure  bring our troops home  care for our veterans  broaden opportunity  restore our democracy  build the middle class  make sure that in this country  no matter who you are  no matter where you come from  no matter how you got started here in america  you can make it if you try  that's why i'm asking for your vote  and if you're willing to work with me again  knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls and turn out  we will win ohio  we'll win this election  we'll finish what we started  we'll renew those ties that bind us together and reaffirm the spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  ohio  god bless the united states of america  let's go vote  let's go do this "], ["obama2", " i the president i  hello  wisconsin  are you fired up   i audience members i  yes   i the

he's done for this campaign  he is an american treasure  he gets embarrassed when you talk about him that way  but he tells the story of what our country is and what it should be and what it can be  and i get to fly around with him on the last day that i will ever campaign  so that's not a bad way to end things  this is an incredible crowd  and it's good to be back  the weather is cooperating  it  sort of  feels like chicago  nice and brisk  there are a couple other people i want to thank before we get started  your next senator from the great state of wisconsin  tammy baldwin  is here  she'll follow in the footsteps of two other outstanding wisconsin senators  herb kohl and russ feingold  who are here  your next congressman  marc pocan  is here  and let's give it up for the mayor of madison  wisconsin  paul soglin  now  for the past week  even in the midst of all this campaigning and electioneering and way too many tv commercials  all of us  including bruce  have been focused on one of the worst storms of our lifetimes  and i had a chance to visit new jersey  and every day i've been talking to mayors and governors and local officials and families  and we mourn those lives that have been lost  and whenever i talk to folks in the region  i tell them the same thing that i say whenever a tragedy besets the american family  and that is  the american people come together and make a commitment  that we will walk with these folks whose lives have been upended every step on the hard road ahead and the hard road to recovery  we'll carry on  no matter how bad the storm is  we will be there together  no matter how bad the storm is  we recover together  we're all in this together  we rise or fall as one nation and as one people  and  you know  madison  that spirit has guided this country along its improbable journey for more than   centuries  it's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last   years  in   we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression  today  our businesses have created nearly   million new jobs  the american auto industry is back on top  home values are on the rise  we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in   years  and we've doubled the production of clean energy across america  because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform  the war in iraq is over  the war in afghanistan is coming to a close  al qaida is on the path to defeat  usama bin laden is dead  we've made progress these last   years  we've made progress these last   years  but the reason we're all gathered here  in addition to listening to bruce i laughter i is because we know we've got more work to do  we've got more work to do  as long as there's a single american who wants a job  but can't find one  our work is not yet done  as long as there are families working harder and harder  but still falling behind  we've got more work to do  as long as there is a child anywhere in madison  in wisconsin  in america  who's languishing in poverty and barred from opportunity  our work is not yet done  the fight goes on  our fight goes on because this nation cannot succeed without a growing  thriving middle class and sturdy  strong ladders for everybody who's willing to work to get into the middle class  our fight goes on because we know america has always done best  we've always prospered  when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share  everybody is playing by the same rules  that's what we believe  that's why you elected me in   and that is why i'm running for a second term as president of the united states   i audience members i  four more years  four more years  four more years   i the president i  now  wisconsin  tomorrow you have a choice to make  and it's not just a choice between two candidates or two parties  it is a choice between two different visions for america  it's a choice between returning to the top down policies that crashed our economy or a future that's built on providing opportunity to everybody and growing a strong middle class  understand  wisconsin  as americans  we honor the strivers  the dreamers  the small businesspeople  the risk takers  the entrepreneurs  who've been the driving force behind our free enterprise system  and that free market is the greatest engine of prosperity and growth the world has ever known  but we also believe that in this country  like no other  our market works  our system works  only when everybody has got a shot  when everybody is participating  when everybody has a chance to get a decent education  when every worker has the chance to get the skills they need  when we support research into medical breakthroughs and new technologies  we believe that america is stronger  not weaker  stronger  when everybody can count on affordable health insurance  we believe our country is better when people can count on medicare and social security in their golden years  we think the market functions more effectively when there are rules in place to make sure our kids are protected from toxic dumping  to make sure consumers aren't being taken advantage of by unscrupulous credit card companies or mortgage lenders  we believe that there's a place for rules and regulations that make sure our people are safe  and we also believe there are some things politicians should stay out of  for example  we think that folks in washington  especially men  should not try to control health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making themselves  now  madison  here's the thing  for   years  we had a president who shared these beliefs  his name was bill clinton  and when he first came into office  his economic plan asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more so we could reduce our deficit and still invest in the skills and ideas of our people  and at the time  the republican congress and a certain senate candidate by the name of mitt romney said bill clinton's plan would hurt the economy  would kill jobs  would hurt the job creators  does this sound familiar   i laughter i  turns out his math back then was just as bad as it is now   i laughter i  because by the end of president clinton's second term  america had created   million new jobs  incomes were up  poverty was down  our deficit had turned into a surplus  so  wisconsin  our ideas have been tested  we've tried them  they worked  the other side's ideas have also been tested  they didn't work so well  after bill clinton left office  during most of the last decade  we tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans  we tried giving insurance companies and oil companies and wall street free rein to do whatever they pleased  and what did we get  falling incomes  record deficits  the slowest job growth in half a century  an economic crisis that we've been cleaning up after ever since  so this should not be that complicated  we tried our ideas  they worked  the economy grew  we created jobs  deficits went down  we tried their ideas  they didn't work  the economy didn't grow  not as many jobs  and the deficit went up  but here's the thing  governor romney is a very talented salesman  and in this campaign  he's tried as hard as he can to repackage the same old bad ideas and make them out to be new ideas  and try to convince you that he's all about change  he's trying to convince you that these bad old ideas are change  listen  we know what change looks like  madison  and what he's selling ain't it  giving more power back to the biggest banks  that's not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  another   trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy is not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  refusing to answer questions about your policies until after the election  that's definitely not change  that's the oldest game in the book   i laughter i  ruling out compromise by pledging to rubberstamp the tea party's agenda in congress  that's not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  changing the facts when they're inconvenient to your campaign  not change   i audience members i  no   i the president i  which raises something else about this presidential campaign  it's not just about policies  it's also about trust  it's also about trust  wisconsin  you know me by now  you may not agree with every decision i've made  you know  michelle doesn't either   i laughter i  you may be frustrated at the pace of change  i promise you  so am i sometimes  but you know that i say what i mean and i mean what i say  i said  i'd end the war in iraq  and i ended it  i said  i'd pass health care reform  i passed it  i said  i'd repeal  don't ask  don't tell  we repealed it  i said  we'd crack down on reckless practices on wall street  and we did  so you know where i stand  you know what i believe  you know i tell the truth  and you know that i'll fight for you and your families every single day as hard as i know how  you know that about me  so when i say  wisconsin  that i know what real change looks like  you've got cause to believe me because you've seen me fight for it and you've seen me deliver it  you've seen the scars on me to prove it  you've seen the gray hair on my head to show you what it means to fight for change  and you've been there with me  and after all we've been through together  we can't give up now   i audience members i  no   i the president i  because we've got more change to do  we've got more change to make  think about the next   years  change is a country where every american has a shot at a great education  and government can't do it alone  parents have to parent  students have to study  but don't tell me that hiring more outstanding teachers won't help this economy grow  of course  it will  don't tell me that students who can't afford to go to college should just borrow money from their parents  that wasn't an option for me  madison  i'll bet it wasn't an option for a lot of the students who are here today  and so that's why i want to cut the growth in tuition in half by the next   years  i want to recruit   new math and science teachers so we don't fall behind the rest of the world  train   million americans at our community colleges with the skills that businesses are looking for right now  that's what change is  that's what we're fighting for in this election  change comes when we live up to this country's legacy of innovation  i could not be prouder that i bet on american workers and the american auto industry  but what makes me really proud is we're not just building cars again  we're building better cars  cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas  which will save you money  help our national security  help our environment  and that kind of innovation  that kind of ingenuity  isn't restricted to the auto industry  we've got thousands of workers building long lasting batteries and wind turbines all across the country  and i don't want to subsidize oil company profits  i want to support the energy jobs of tomorrow  the new technologies  that will cut our oil imports in half  take some of the carbon out of the atmosphere  i don't want a tax code that rewards companies for creating jobs overseas  i want to reward companies that are investing right here in wisconsin in the next generation of manufacturing in america  that's my plan for jobs and growth  and that's what we're fighting for in this election  change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation building here at home  as long as i'm commander in chief  we will always pursue our enemies with the strongest military the world has ever known  but it's time to use the savings from the wars in iraq and afghanistan to pay down our debt and rebuild america  putting some hardhats back to work repairing roads and bridges  making our schools state of the art all across this country  hiring our veterans  because if you fought for our freedom  you shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over your head or the services you've earned when you come home  and that's what will keep us strong  that's my commitment to you  and that's what's at stake in this election  and  yes  change is a future where we reduce our deficit  but we do it in a balanced  responsible way  i've signed a trillion dollars' worth of spending cuts  gotten rid of programs that aren't working  i intend to do more  but if we're serious about the deficit  we can't just cut our way to prosperity  we've also got to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the tax rates they paid when bill clinton was in office  and by the way  we can afford it  i haven't talked to bruce  but i know he can afford it  i can afford it  mr  romney  he can afford it   i laughter i  because our budget reflects our values  it's a reflection of our priorities  and as long as i'm president  i'm not going to kick some poor kids off of head start to give me a tax cut  i'm not going to turn medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut  so  wisconsin  we know what change is  we know what the future requires  but we also know it's not going to be easy  back in   we talked about it  i know everybody sometimes romanticizes the last campaign  and the posters and all the good feeling  but i said back then  when i talk about change  i'm not just talking about changing presidents or political parties  i'm talking about changing how our politics works  i ran because the voices of the american people  your voices  had been shut out of our democracy for way too long by lobbyists and special interests and politicians who will say and do anything just to keep things the way they are  to protect the status quo  and the status quo in washington is fierce  and over the last   years  that status quo has fought us every step of the way  they spent millions trying to stop us from reforming the health care system  spent millions trying to prevent us from reforming wall street  they engineered a strategy of gridlock in congress  refusing to compromise on ideas that both democrats and republicans had agreed to in the past  and what they're counting on now is that you're going to be so worn down  so fed up  so tired of all the squabbling  so tired of all the dysfunction  that you're just going to give up and walk away  and leave them   i audience members i  no   i the president   i leave them right where they are  pulling the strings  pulling the levers  and you locked out of the decisions that impact your lives  in other words  their bet is on cynicism  but  wisconsin  my bet is on you  my bet is on you  and understand  i'm not making a partisan point here  when the other party has been willing to work with me to cut middle class taxes for families and small businesses  or some courageous republican senators crossing the aisle to support the repeal of  don't ask  don't tell  i'm thrilled because we're not democrats or republicans first we're americans first  as long as i'm president  i'll work with anybody of any party to move this country forward  and if you want to break the gridlock in congress  you'll vote for leaders like tammy baldwin  whether they're democrats or republicans or independents  who feel the same way  who put you first  not the next election first  but you know what  sometimes you got to fight  sometimes you got to stand on principle  if the price of peace in washington is cutting deals to cut students off of financial aid or get rid of funding for planned parenthood or let insurance companies discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or eliminate health care for millions of folks who are on medicaid who are poor or elderly or disabled  i won't pay that price  that's not a deal i'll take  that's not bipartisanship  that's not bipartisanship  that's not change  that's surrender  that's surrender to the same status quo that's been squeezing middle class families for way too long  that's not why i ran for president  to leave things the way they are  i'm not ready to give up on that fight  i'm not ready to give up on that fight  wisconsin  and i hope you aren't either   i audience members i  no   i the president i  now  the folks at the very top in this country  they don't need another champion in washington  they'll always have a seat at the table  they'll always have access  they'll always have influence  that's the nature of things  the people who need a champion are the americans whose letters i read late at night after a long day in the office  the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day  the laid off worker who's going back to community college to retrain at the age of   for a new career  she needs a champion  the restaurant owner who's got great food  but needs a loan to expand after the bank turned him down  he needs a champion  the cooks and the waiters and the cleaning staff at a madison hotel  trying to save enough to buy a first home or send their kid to college  they need a champion  the autoworker who never thought he'd see the line again and now is back on the job filled with pride and dignity  because it's not just building a great car  it's not just about a paycheck  it's about taking pride in what you do he needs a champion  a teacher in an overcrowded classroom with old  outdated  textbooks digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies  frustrated sometimes  not getting the support she needs  but knowing every single day she might make a difference in that one child's life  and that makes it all worth it she needs a champion  all those kids in inner cities and small farm towns  in the valleys of ohio  the rolling virginia hills  or in the streets of madison kids dreaming of becoming scientists or doctors or engineers or entrepreneurs  diplomats  maybe even a president they need a champion  they don't have lobbyists  the future never has as many lobbyists as the status quo  but it is the dreams of those children that will be our saving grace  that's what will propel us forward  that's what will make america continue to be this shining light on a hill  and that's why i need you  wisconsin  to make sure the voices of those children are heard  to make sure your voices are heard  we have come too far to turn back now  we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint  now is the time to keep pushing forward  to educate all our kids and train all our workers  create new jobs  bring our troops home  care for our veterans  broaden opportunity  grow our middle class  restore our democracy  and make sure that no matter who you are  no matter where you come from  no matter how you started out  no matter what your last name is you can make it here in america if you try  and  wisconsin  that's why i need your vote  and if you're willing to work with me again and knock on some doors with me  make some phone calls for me  turn out for me  we'll win wisconsin  we'll win this election  we'll finish what we started  we'll renew the bonds that bind us together  we'll reaffirm the spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on earth  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "]]
