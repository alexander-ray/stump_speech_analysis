[["obama1", "thank you so much for your kind introduction and the invitation to meet with you this morning  last week  this event was described to me as a small gathering of friends  looking at all of you here today  seeing so many of you who care about peace in this world  who care about a strong and lasting friendship between israel and the united states  and who care about what's on the next page of our shared futures  i think  a small gathering of friends  fits this crowd just right  i want to begin today by telling you a story  back in january of   i made my first trip to the holy land  it is a place unlike any other on this earth   a place filled with so much promise of what we truly can be as people  a place where we've learned how in a flash  violence and hatred and intolerance can turn that promise to rubble and send too many lives to their early graves  most will travel to the holy sites  the church of the holy sepulcher  the dome of the rock or the western wall  they make a journey to be humbled before god  i too am blessed to have seen israel this way  up close and on the ground  but i am also fortunate to have seen israel from the air  on my journey that january day  i flew on an idf helicopter to the border zone  the helicopter took us over the most troubled and dangerous areas and that narrow strip between the west bank and the mediterranean sea  at that height  i could see the hills and the terrain that generations have walked across  i could truly see how close everything is and why peace through security is the only way for israel  our helicopter landed in the town of kiryat shmona on the border  what struck me first about the village was how familiar it looked  the houses and streets looked like ones you might find in a suburb in america  i could imagine young children riding their bikes down the streets  i could imagine the sounds of their joyful play just like my own daughters  there were cars in the driveway  the shrubs were trimmed  the families were living their lives  then  i saw a house that had been hit with one of hezbollah's katyusha rockets  the family who lived in the house was lucky to be alive  they had been asleep in another part when the rocket hit  they described the explosion  they talked about the fire and the shrapnel  they spoke about what might have been if the rocket had come screaming into their home at another time when they weren't asleep but sitting peacefully in the now destroyed part of the house  it is an experience i keep close to my heart  not because it is unique  but because we know that too many others have seen the same kind of destruction  have lost their loved ones to suicide bombers and live in fear of when the next attack might hit  just six months after i visited  hezbollah launched four thousand rocket attacks just like the one that destroyed the home in kiryat shmona  and kidnapped israeli service members  and we pray for all of the service members who have been kidnapped  gilad shalit  eldad regev  and ehud goldwasser  and i met with his family this week  i offered to help in any way i can  it is important to remember this history that israel had unilaterally withdrawn from lebanon only to have iran supply hezbollah with thousands of rockets  our job is to never forget that the threat of violence is real  our job is to renew the united states' efforts to help israel achieve peace with its neighbors while remaining vigilant against those who do not share this vision  our job is to do more than lay out another road map  our job is to rebuild the road to real peace and lasting security throughout the region  that effort begins with a clear and strong commitment to the security of israel  our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy  that will always be my starting point  and when we see all of the growing threats in the region  from iran to iraq to the resurgence of al qaeda to the reinvigoration of hamas and hezbollah  that loyalty and that friendship will guide me as we begin to lay the stones that will build the road that takes us from the current instability to lasting peace and security  it won't be easy  some of those stones will be heavy and tough for the united states to carry  others with be heavy and tough for israel to carry  and even more will be difficult for the world  but together  we will begin again  one of the heavy stones that currently rest at the united states' feet is iraq  until we lift this burden from our foreign policy  we cannot rally the world to our values and vision  as many of you know  i opposed this war from the beginning   in part because i believed that giving this president the open ended authority to invade iraq would lead to the open ended occupation we find ourselves in today  now our soldiers find themselves in the crossfire of someone else's civil war  more than   have given the last full measure of devotion to their country  this war has fueled terrorism and helped galvanize terrorist organizations  and it has made the world less safe  that is why i advocate a phased redeployment of u s  troops out of iraq to begin no later than may first with the goal of removing all combat forces from iraq by march   in a civil war where no military solution exists  this redeployment remains our best leverage to pressure the iraqi government to achieve the political settlement between its warring factions that can slow the bloodshed and promote stability  my plan also allows for a limited number of u s  troops to remain and prevent iraq from becoming a haven for international terrorism and reduce the risk of all out chaos  in addition  we will redeploy our troops to other locations in the region  reassuring our allies that we will stay engaged in the middle east  and my plan includes a robust regional diplomatic strategy that includes talking to syria and iran   something this administration has finally embraced  the u s  military has performed valiantly and brilliantly in iraq  our troops have done all that we have asked them to do and more  but a consequence of the administration's failed strategy in iraq has been to strengthen iran's strategic position  reduce u s  credibility and influence in the region  and place israel and other nations friendly to the united states in greater peril  these are not the signs of a well paved road  it is time for profound change  as the u s  redeploys from iraq  we can recapture lost influence in the middle east  we can refocus our efforts to critical  yet neglected priorities  such as combating international terrorism and winning the war in afghanistan  and we can  then  more effectively deal with one of the greatest threats to the united states  israel and world peace  iran  iran's president ahmadinejad's regime is a threat to all of us  his words contain a chilling echo of some of the world's most tragic history  unfortunately  history has a terrible way of repeating itself  president ahmadinejad has denied the holocaust  he held a conference in his country  claiming it was a myth  but we know the holocaust was as real as the   million who died in mass graves at buchenwald  or the cattle cars to dachau or whose ashes clouded the sky at auschwitz  we have seen the pictures  we have walked the halls of the holocaust museum in washington and yad vashem  we have touched the tattoos on loved ones arms  after   years  it is time to deny the deniers  in the  st century  it is unacceptable that a member state of the united nations would openly call for the elimination of another member state  but that is exactly what he has done  neither israel nor the united states has the luxury of dismissing these outrages as mere rhetoric  the world must work to stop iran's uranium enrichment program and prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons  it is far too dangerous to have nuclear weapons in the hands of a radical theocracy  and while we should take no option  including military action  off the table  sustained and aggressive diplomacy combined with tough sanctions should be our primary means to prevent iran from building nuclear weapons  iranian nuclear weapons would destabilize the region and could set off a new arms race  some nations in the region  such as egypt  saudi arabia and turkey  could fall away from restraint and rush into a nuclear contest that could fuel greater instability in the region that's not just bad for the middle east  but bad for the world  making it a vastly more dangerous and unpredictable place  other nations would feel great pressure to accommodate iranian demands  terrorist groups with iran's backing would feel emboldened to act even more brazenly under an iranian nuclear umbrella  and as the a q  kahn network in pakistan demonstrated  iran could spread this technology around the world  to prevent this worst case scenario  we need the united states to lead tough minded diplomacy  this includes direct engagement with iran similar to the meetings we conducted with the soviets at the height of the cold war  laying out in clear terms our principles and interests  tough minded diplomacy would include real leverage through stronger sanctions  it would mean more determined u s diplomacy at the united nations  it would mean harnessing the collective power of our friends in europe who are iran's major trading partners  it would mean a cooperative strategy with gulf states who supply iran with much of the energy resources it needs  it would mean unifying those states to recognize the threat of iran and increase pressure on iran to suspend uranium enrichment  it would mean full implementation of u s  sanctions laws  and over the long term  it would mean a focused approach from us to finally end the tyranny of oil  and develop our own alternative sources of energy to drive the price of oil down  we must also persuade other nations such as saudi arabia to recognize common interests with israel in dealing with iran  we should stress to the egyptians that they help the iranians and do themselves no favors by failing to adequately prevent the smuggling of weapons and cash by iran into gaza  the united states' leverage is strengthened when we have many nations with us  it puts us in a place where sanctions could actually have a profound impact on iran's economy  iran is highly dependent on imports and foreign investment  credit and technology  and an environment where our allies see that these types of investments in iran are not in the world's best interests  could help bring iran to the table  we have no quarrel with the iranian people  they know that president ahamadinejad is reckless  irresponsible  and inattentive to their day to day needs which is why they sent him a rebuke at the ballot box this fall  and we hope more of them will speak out  there is great hope in their ability to see his hatred for what it is  hatred and a threat to peace in the region  at the same time  we must preserve our total commitment to our unique defense relationship with israel by fully funding military assistance and continuing work on the arrow and related missile defense programs  this would help israel maintain its military edge and deter and repel attacks from as far as tehran and as close as gaza  and when israel is attacked  we must stand up for israel's legitimate right to defend itself  last summer  hezbollah attacked israel  by using lebanon as an outpost for terrorism  and innocent people as shields  hezbollah has also engulfed that entire nation in violence and conflict  and threatened the fledgling movement for democracy there  that's why we have to press for enforcement of u n  security council resolution   which demands the cessation of arms shipments to hezbollah  a resolution which syria and iran continue to disregard  their support and shipment of weapons to hezbollah and hamas  which threatens the peace and security in the region  must end  these are great challenges that we face  and in moments like these  true allies do not walk away  for six years  the administration has missed opportunities to increase the united states' influence in the region and help israel achieve the peace she wants and the security she needs  the time has come for us to seize those opportunities  the israeli people  and prime minister olmert  have made clear that they are more than willing to negotiate an end to the israeli palestinian conflict that will result in two states living side by side in peace and security  but the israelis must trust that they have a true palestinian partner for peace  that is why we must strengthen the hands of palestinian moderates who seek peace and that is why we must maintain the isolation of hamas and other extremists who are committed to israel's destruction  the u s  and our partners have put before hamas three very simple conditions to end this isolation  recognize israel's right to exist  renounce the use of violence  and abide by past agreements between israel and the palestinian authority  we should all be concerned about the agreement negotiated among palestinians in mecca last month  the reports of this agreement suggest that hamas  fatah  and independent ministers would sit in a government together  under a hamas prime minister  without any recognition of israel  without a renunciation of violence  and with only an ambiguous promise to  respect  previous agreements  this should concern us all because it suggests that mahmoud abbas  who is a palestinian leader i believe is committed to peace  felt forced to compromise with hamas  however  if we are serious about the quartet's conditions  we must tell the palestinians this is not good enough  but as i said at the outset  israel will have some heavy stones to carry as well  its history has been full of tough choices in search of peace and security  yitzhak rabin had the vision to reach out to longtime enemies  ariel sharon had the determination to lead israel out of gaza  these were difficult  painful decisions that went to the heart of israel's identity as a nation  many israelis i talked to during my visit last year told me that they were prepared to make sacrifices to give their children a chance to know peace  these were people of courage who wanted a better life  and i know these are difficult times and it can be easy to lose hope  but we owe it to our sons and daughters  our mothers and fathers  and to all those who have fallen  to keep searching for peace and security   even though it can seem distant  this search is in the best interests of israel  it is in the best interests of the united states  it is in the best interests of all of us  we can and we should help israelis and palestinians both fulfill their national goals  two states living side by side in peace and security  both the israeli and palestinian people have suffered from the failure to achieve this goal  the united states should leave no stone unturned in working to make that goal a reality  but in the end  we also know that we should never seek to dictate what is best for the israelis and their security interests  no israeli prime minister should ever feel dragged to or blocked from the negotiating table by the united states  we must be partners   we must be active partners  diplomacy in the middle east cannot be done on the cheap  diplomacy is measured by patience and effort  we cannot continue to have trips consisting of little more than photo ops with little movement in between  neither israel nor the u s  is served by this approach  peace with security  that is the israeli people's overriding wish  it is what i saw in the town of fassouta on the border with lebanon  there are   residents of different faiths and histories  there is a community center supported by chicago's own roman catholic archdiocese and the jewish federation of metro chicago  it is where the education of the next generation has begun  in a small village  all faiths and nationalities  living together with mutual respect  i met with the people from the village and they gave me a tour of this wonderful place  there was a moment when the young girls came in and they played music and began to dance  after a few moments  i thought about my own daughters  sasha and malia and how they too could dream and dance in a place like this  a place of renewal and restoration  proof  that in the heart of so much peril  there were signs of life and hope and promise that the universal song for peace plays on  thank you "], ["obama1", "here today  i must begin because at the unity breakfast this morning i was saving for last and the list was so long i left him out after that introduction  so i'm going to start by saying how much i appreciate the friendship and the support and the outstanding work that he does each and every day  not just in capitol hill but also back here in the district  please give a warm round of applause for your congressman artur davis  it is a great honor to be here  reverend jackson  thank you so much  to the family of brown a m e  to the good bishop kirkland  thank you for your wonderful message and your leadership  i want to acknowledge one of the great heroes of american history and american life  somebody who captures the essence of decency and courage  somebody who i have admired all my life and were it not for him  i'm not sure i'd be here today  congressman john lewis  i'm thankful to him  to all the distinguished guests and clergy  i'm not sure i'm going to thank reverend lowery because he stole the show  i was mentioning earlier  i know we've got c t  vivian in the audience  and when you have to speak in front of somebody who martin luther king said was the greatest preacher he ever heard  then you've got some problems  and i'm a little nervous about following so many great preachers  but i'm hoping that the spirit moves me and to all my colleagues who have given me such a warm welcome  thank you very much for allowing me to speak to you here today  you know  several weeks ago  after i had announced that i was running for the presidency of the united states  i stood in front of the old state capitol in springfield  illinois  where abraham lincoln delivered his speech declaring  drawing in scripture  that a house divided against itself could not stand  and i stood and i announced that i was running for the presidency  and there were a lot of commentators  as they are prone to do  who questioned the audacity of a young man like myself  haven't been in washington too long  and i acknowledge that there is a certain presumptuousness about this  but i got a letter from a friend of some of yours named reverend otis moss jr  in cleveland  and his son  otis moss iii is the pastor at my church and i must send greetings from dr  jeremiah a  wright jr  but i got a letter giving me encouragement and saying how proud he was that i had announced and encouraging me to stay true to my ideals and my values and not to be fearful  and he said  if there's some folks out there who are questioning whether or not you should run  just tell them to look at the story of joshua because you're part of the joshua generation  so i just want to talk a little about moses and aaron and joshua  because we are in the presence today of a lot of moseses  we're in the presence today of giants whose shoulders we stand on  people who battled  not just on behalf of african americans but on behalf of all of america  that battled for america's soul  that shed blood   that endured taunts and formant and in some cases gave   torment and in some cases gave the full measure of their devotion  like moses  they challenged pharaoh  the princes  powers who said that some are atop and others are at the bottom  and that's how it's always going to be  there were people like anna cooper and marie foster and jimmy lee jackson and maurice olette  c t  vivian  reverend lowery  john lewis  who said we can imagine something different and we know there is something out there for us  too  thank god  he's made us in his image and we reject the notion that we will for the rest of our lives be confined to a station of inferiority  that we can't aspire to the highest of heights  that our talents can't be expressed to their fullest  and so because of what they endured  because of what they marched  they led a people out of bondage  they took them across the sea that folks thought could not be parted  they wandered through a desert but always knowing that god was with them and that  if they maintained that trust in god  that they would be all right  and it's because they marched that the next generation hasn't been bloodied so much  it's because they marched that we elected councilmen  congressmen  it is because they marched that we have artur davis and keith ellison  it is because they marched that i got the kind of education i got  a law degree  a seat in the illinois senate and ultimately in the united states senate it is because they marched that i stand before you here today  i was mentioning at the unity breakfast this morning  my   at the unity breakfast this morning that my debt is even greater than that because not only is my career the result of the work of the men and women who we honor here today  my very existence might not have been possible had it not been for some of the folks here today  i mentioned at the unity breakfast that a lot of people been asking  well  you know  your father was from africa  your mother  she's a white woman from kansas  i'm not sure that you have the same experience  and i tried to explain  you don't understand  you see  my grandfather was a cook to the british in kenya  grew up in a small village and all his life  that's all he was   a cook and a house boy  and that's what they called him  even when he was   years old  they called him a house boy  they wouldn't call him by his last name  sound familiar  he had to carry a passbook around because africans in their own land  in their own country  at that time  because it was a british colony  could not move about freely  they could only go where they were told to go  they could only work where they were told to work  yet something happened back here in selma  alabama  something happened in birmingham that sent out what bobby kennedy called   ripples of hope all around the world  something happened when a bunch of women decided they were going to walk instead of ride the bus after a long day of doing somebody else's laundry  looking after somebody else's children  when men who had phd's decided that's enough and we're going to stand up for our dignity  that sent a shout across oceans so that my grandfather began to imagine something different for his son  his son  who grew up herding goats in a small village in africa could suddenly set his sights a little higher and believe that maybe a black man in this world had a chance  what happened in selma  alabama and birmingham also stirred the conscience of the nation  it worried folks in the white house who said   you know  we're battling communism  how are we going to win hearts and minds all across the world  if right here in our own country  john  we're not observing the ideals set fort in our constitution  we might be accused of being hypocrites  so the kennedy's decided we're going to do an air lift  we're going to go to africa and start bringing young africans over to this country and give them scholarships to study so they can learn what a wonderful country america is  this young man named barack obama got one of those tickets and came over to this country  he met this woman whose great great great great grandfather had owned slaves  but she had a good idea there was some craziness going on because they looked at each other and they decided that we know that the world as it has been it might not be possible for us to get together and have a child  there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma  alabama  because some folks are willing to march across a bridge  so they got together and barack obama jr  was born  so don't tell me i don't have a claim on selma  alabama  don't tell me i'm not coming home to selma  alabama  i'm here because somebody marched  i'm here because you all sacrificed for me  i stand on the shoulders of giants  i thank the moses generation  but we've got to remember  now  that joshua still had a job to do  as great as moses was  despite all that he did  leading a people out of bondage  he didn't cross over the river to see the promised land  god told him your job is done  you'll see it  you'll be at the mountain top and you can see what i've promised  what i've promised to abraham and isaac and jacob  you will see that i've fulfilled that promise but you won't go there  we're going to leave it to the joshua generation to make sure it happens  there are still battles that need to be fought  some rivers that need to be crossed  like moses  the task was passed on to those who might not have been as deserving  might not have been as courageous  find themselves in front of the risks that their parents and grandparents and great grandparents had taken  that doesn't mean that they don't still have a burden to shoulder  that they don't have some responsibilities  the previous generation  the moses generation  pointed the way  they took us   of the way there  we still got that   in order to cross over to the other side  so the question  i guess  that i have today is what's called of us in this joshua generation  what do we do in order to fulfill that legacy  to fulfill the obligations and the debt that we owe to those who allowed us to be here today now  i don't think we could ever fully repay that debt  i think that we're always going to be looking back  but there are at least a few suggestions that i would have in terms of how we might fulfill that enormous legacy  the first is to recognize our history  john lewis talked about why we're here today  but i worry sometimes   we've got black history month  we come down and march every year  once a year  we occasionally celebrate the various events of the civil rights movement  we celebrate dr  king's birthday  but it strikes me that understanding our history and knowing what it means  is an everyday activity  moses told the joshua generation  don't forget where you came from  i worry sometimes  that the joshua generation in its success forgets where it came from  thinks it doesn't have to make as many sacrifices  thinks that the very height of ambition is to make as much money as you can  to drive the biggest car and have the biggest house and wear a rolex watch and get your own private jet  get some of that oprah money  and i think that's a good thing  there's nothing wrong with making money  but if you know your history  then you know that there is a certain poverty of ambition involved in simply striving just for money  materialism alone will not fulfill the possibilities of your existence  you have to fill that with something else  you have to fill it with the golden rule  you've got to fill it with thinking about others  and if we know our history  then we will understand that that is the highest mark of service  second thing that the joshua generation needs to understand is that the principles of equality that were set fort and were battled for have to be fought each and every day  it is not a one time thing  i was remarking at the unity breakfast on the fact that the single most significant concern that this justice department under this administration has had with respect to discrimination has to do with affirmative action  that they have basically spent all their time worrying about colleges and universities around the country that are given a little break to young african americans and hispanics to make sure that they can go to college  too i had a school in southern illinois that set up a program for phd's in math and science for african americans  and the reason they had set it up is because we only had less than   of the phd's in science and math go to african americans  at a time when we are competing in a global economy  when we're not competing just against folks in north carolina or florida or california  we're competing against folks in china and india and we need math and science majors  this university thought this might be a nice thing to do  and the justice department wrote them a letter saying we are going to threaten to sue you for reverse discrimination unless you cease this program  and it reminds us that we still got a lot of work to do  and that the basic enforcement of anti discrimination laws  the injustice that still exists within our criminal justice system  the disparity in terms of how people are treated in this country continues  it has gotten better  and we should never deny that it's gotten better  but we shouldn't forget that better is not good enough  that until we have absolute equality in this country in terms of people being treated on the basis of their color or their gender  that that is something that we've got to continue to work on and the joshua generation has a significant task in making that happen  third thing   we've got to recognize that we fought for civil rights  but we've still got a lot of economic rights that have to be dealt with  we've got   million people uninsured in this country despite spending more money on health care than any nation on earth  it makes no sense  as a consequence  we've got what's known as a health care disparity in this nation because many of the uninsured are african american or latino  life expectancy is lower  almost every disease is higher within minority communities  the health care gap  blacks are less likely in their schools to have adequate funding  we have less qualified teachers in those schools  we have fewer textbooks in those schools  we got in some schools rats outnumbering computers  that's called the achievement gap  you've got a health care gap and you've got an achievement gap  you've got katrina still undone  i went down to new orleans three weeks ago  it still looks bombed out  still not rebuilt  when   happened  the federal government had a special program of grants to help rebuild  they waived any requirement that manhattan would have to pay   of the cost of rebuilding  when hurricane andrew happened in florida    requirement  they waived it because they understood that some disasters are so devastating that we can't expect a community to rebuild  new orleans   the largest national catastrophe in our history  the federal government says where's your   there is an empathy gap  there is a gap in terms of sympathizing for the folks in new orleans  it's not a gap that the american people felt because we saw how they responded  but somehow our government didn't respond with that same sense of compassion  with that same sense of kindness  and here is the worst part  the tragedy in new orleans happened well before the hurricane struck because many of those communities  there were so many young men in prison  so many kids dropping out  so little hope  a hope gap  a hope gap that still pervades too many communities all across the country and right here in alabama  so the question is  then  what are we  the joshua generation  doing to close those gaps  are we doing every single thing that we can do in congress in order to make sure that early education is adequately funded and making sure that we are raising the minimum wage so people can have dignity and respect  are we ensuring that  if somebody loses a job  that they're getting retrained  and that  if they've lost their health care and pension  somebody is there to help them get back on their feet  are we making sure we're giving a second chance to those who have strayed and gone to prison but want to start a new life  government alone can't solve all those problems  but government can help  it's the responsibility of the joshua generation to make sure that we have a government that is as responsive as the need that exists all across america  that brings me to one other point  about the joshua generation  and that is this   that it's not enough just to ask what the government can do for us  it's important for us to ask what we can do for ourselves  one of the signature aspects of the civil rights movement was the degree of discipline and fortitude that was instilled in all the people who participated  imagine young people          backs straight  eyes clear  suit and tie  sitting down at a lunch counter knowing somebody is going to spill milk on you but you have the discipline to understand that you are not going to retaliate because in showing the world how disciplined we were as a people  we were able to win over the conscience of the nation  i can't say for certain that we have instilled that same sense of moral clarity and purpose in this generation  bishop  sometimes i feel like we've lost it a little bit  i'm fighting to make sure that our schools are adequately funded all across the country  with the inequities of relying on property taxes and people who are born in wealthy districts getting better schools than folks born in poor districts and that's now how it's supposed to be  that's not the american way  but i'll tell you what   even as i fight on behalf of more education funding  more equity  i have to also say that   if parents don't turn off the television set when the child comes home from school and make sure they sit down and do their homework and go talk to the teachers and find out how they're doing  and if we don't start instilling a sense in our young children that there is nothing to be ashamed about in educational achievement  i don't know who taught them that reading and writing and conjugating your verbs was something white  we've got to get over that mentality  that is part of what the moses generation teaches us  not saying to ourselves we can't do something  but telling ourselves that we can achieve  we can do that  we got power in our hands  folks are complaining about the quality of our government  i understand there's something to be complaining about  i'm in washington  i see what's going on  i see those powers and principalities have snuck back in there  that they're writing the energy bills and the drug laws  we understand that  but i'll tell you what  i also know that  if cousin pookie would vote  get off the couch and register some folks and go to the polls  we might have a different kind of politics  that's what the moses generation teaches us  take off your bedroom slippers  put on your marching shoes  go do some politics  change this country  that's what we need  we have too many children in poverty in this country and everybody should be ashamed  but don't tell me it doesn't have a little to do with the fact that we got too many daddies not acting like daddies  don't think that fatherhood ends at conception  i know something about that because my father wasn't around when i was young and i struggled  those of you who read my book know  i went through some difficult times  i know what it means when you don't have a strong male figure in the house  which is why the hardest thing about me being in politics sometimes is not being home as much as i'd like and i'm just blessed that i've got such a wonderful wife at home to hold things together  don't tell me that we can't do better by our children  that we can't take more responsibility for making sure we're instilling in them the values and the ideals that the moses generation taught us about sacrifice and dignity and honesty and hard work and discipline and self sacrifice  that comes from us  we've got to transmit that to the next generation and i guess the point that i'm making is that the civil rights movement wasn't just a fight against the oppressor  it was also a fight against the oppressor in each of us  sometimes it's easy to just point at somebody else and say it's their fault  but oppression has a way of creeping into it  reverend  it has a way of stunting yourself  you start telling yourself  bishop  i can't do something  i can't read  i can't go to college  i can't start a business  i can't run for congress  i can't run for the presidency  people start telling you  you can't do something  after a while  you start believing it and part of what the civil rights movement was about was recognizing that we have to transform ourselves in order to transform the world  mahatma gandhi  great hero of dr  king and the person who helped create the nonviolent movement around the world  he once said that you can't change the world if you haven't changed  if you want to change the world  the change has to happen with you first and that is something that the greatest and most honorable of generations has taught us  but the final thing that i think the moses generation teaches us is to remind ourselves that we do what we do because god is with us  you know  when moses was first called to lead people out of the promised land  he said i don't think i can do it  lord  i don't speak like reverend lowery  i don't feel brave and courageous and the lord said i will be with you  throw down that rod  pick it back up  i'll show you what to do  the same thing happened with the joshua generation joshua said  you know  i'm scared  i'm not sure that i am up to the challenge  the lord said to him  every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon  i have given you  be strong and have courage  for i am with you wherever you go  be strong and have courage  it's a prayer for a journey  a prayer that kept a woman in her seat when the bus driver told her to get up  a prayer that led nine children through the doors of the little rock school  a prayer that carried our brothers and sisters over a bridge right here in selma  alabama  be strong and have courage  when you see row and row of state trooper facing you  the horses and the tear gas  how else can you walk  towards them  unarmed  unafraid  when they come start beating your friends and neighbors  how else can you simply kneel down  bow your head and ask the lord for salvation  when you see heads gashed open and eyes burning and children lying hurt on the side of the road  when you are john lewis and you've been beaten within an inch of your life on sunday  how do you wake up monday and keep on marching  be strong and have courage  for i am with you wherever you go  we've come a long way in this journey  but we still have a long way to travel  we traveled because god was with us  it's not how far we've come  that bridge outside was crossed by blacks and whites  northerners and southerners  teenagers and children  the beloved community of god's children  they wanted to take those steps together  but it was left to the joshua's to finish the journey moses had begun and today we're called to be the joshua's of our time  to be the generation that finds our way across this river  there will be days when the water seems wide and the journey too far  but in those moments  we must remember that throughout our history  there has been a running thread of ideals that have guided our travels and pushed us forward  even when they're just beyond our reach  liberty in the face of tyranny  opportunity where there was none and hope over the most crushing despair  those ideals and values beckon us still and when we have our doubts and our fears  just like joshua did  when the road looks too long and it seems like we may lose our way  remember what these people did on that bridge keep in your heart the prayer of that journey  the prayer that god gave to joshua  be strong and have courage in the face of injustice  be strong and have courage in the face of prejudice and hatred  in the face of joblessness and helplessness and hopelessness  be strong and have courage  brothers and sisters  those who are gathered here today  in the face of our doubts and fears  in the face of skepticism  in the face of cynicism  in the face of a mighty river  be strong and have courage and let us cross over that promised land together  thank you so much everybody  god bless you "], ["obama1", "good morning  we all know that these are not the best of times for america's reputation in the world  we know what the war in iraq has cost us in lives and treasure  in influence and respect  we have seen the consequences of a foreign policy based on a flawed ideology  and a belief that tough talk can replace real strength and vision many around the world are disappointed with our actions  and many in our own country have come to doubt either our wisdom or our capacity to shape events beyond our borders  some have even suggested that america's time has passed but while we know what we have lost as a consequence of this tragic war  i also know what i have found in my travels over the past two years in an old building in ukraine  i saw test tubes filled with anthrax and the plague lying virtually unlocked and unguarded   dangers we were told could only be secured with america's help on a trip to the middle east  i met israelis and palestinians who told me that peace remains a distant hope without the promise of american leadership at a camp along the border of chad and darfur  refugees begged for america to step in and help stop the genocide that has taken their mothers and fathers  sons and daughters and along the crowded streets of kenya  i met throngs of children who asked if they'd ever get the chance to visit that magical place called america so i reject the notion that the american moment has passed  i dismiss the cynics who say that this new century cannot be another when  in the words of president franklin roosevelt  we lead the world in battling immediate evils and promoting the ultimate good i still believe that america is the last  best hope of earth  we just have to show the world why this is so  this president may occupy the white house  but for the last six years the position of leader of the free world has remained open  and it's time to fill that role once more i believe that the single most important job of any president is to protect the american people  and i am equally convinced that doing that job effectively in the  st century will require a new vision of american leadership and a new conception of our national security   a vision that draws from the lessons of the past  but is not bound by outdated thinking in today's globalized world  the security of the american people is inextricably linked to the security of all people  when narco trafficking and corruption threaten democracy in latin america  it's america's problem too  when poor villagers in indonesia have no choice but to send chickens to market infected with avian flu  it cannot be seen as a distant concern  when religious schools in pakistan teach hatred to young children  our children are threatened as well whether it's global terrorism or pandemic disease  dramatic climate change or the proliferation of weapons of mass annihilation  the threats we face at the dawn of the  st century can no longer be contained by borders and boundaries the horrific attacks on that clear september day awakened us to this new reality  and after   millions around the world were ready to stand with us  they were willing to rally to our cause because it was their cause too   because they knew that if america led the world toward a new era of global cooperation  it would advance the security of people in our nation and all nations we now know how badly this administration squandered that opportunity  in   i stated my opposition to the war in iraq  not only because it was an unnecessary diversion from the struggle against the terrorists who attacked us on september  th  but also because it was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the threats that   brought to light  i believed then  and believe now  that it was based on old ideologies and outdated strategies   a determination to fight a  st century struggle with a  th century mindset there is no doubt that the mistakes of the past six years have made our current task more difficult  world opinion has turned against us  and after all the lives lost and the billions of dollars spent  many americans may find it tempting to turn inward  and cede our claim of leadership in world affairs i insist  however  that such an abandonment of our leadership is a mistake we must not make  america cannot meet the threats of this century alone  but the world cannot meet them without america  we must neither retreat from the world nor try to bully it into submission   we must lead the world  by deed and example we must lead by building a  st century military to ensure the security of our people and advance the security of all people  we must lead by marshalling a global effort to stop the spread of the world's most dangerous weapons  we must lead by building and strengthening the partnerships and alliances necessary to meet our common challenges and defeat our common threats and america must lead by reaching out to all those living disconnected lives of despair in the world's forgotten corners   because while there will always be those who succumb to hate and strap bombs to their bodies  there are millions more who want to take another path   who want our beacon of hope to shine its light their way this election offers us the chance to turn the page and open a new chapter in american leadership  the disappointment that so many around the world feel toward america right now is only a testament to the high expectations they hold for us  we must meet those expectations again  not because being respected is an end in itself  but because the security of america and the wider world demands it this will require a new spirit   not of bluster and bombast  but of quiet confidence and sober intelligence  a spirit of care and renewed competence  it will also require a new leader  and as a candidate for president of the united states  i am asking you to entrust me with that responsibility there are five ways america will begin to lead again when i'm president  five ways to let the world know that we are committed to our common security  invested in our common humanity  and still a beacon of freedom and justice for the world the first way america will lead is by bringing a responsible end to this war in iraq and refocusing on the critical challenges in the broader region in a speech five months ago  i argued that there can be no military solution to what has become a political conflict between sunni and shi'a factions  and i laid out a plan that i still believe offers the best chance of pressuring these warring factions toward a political settlement   a phased withdrawal of american forces with the goal of removing all combat brigades from iraq by march  st   i acknowledged at the time that there are risks involved in such an approach  that is why my plan provides for an over the horizon force that could prevent chaos in the wider region  and allows for a limited number of troops to remain in iraq to fight al qaeda and other terrorists but my plan also makes clear that continued u s  commitment to iraq depends on the iraqi government meeting a series of well defined benchmarks necessary to reach a political settlement  thus far  the iraqi government has made very little progress in meeting any of the benchmarks  in part because the president has refused time and again to tell the iraqi government that we will not be there forever  the president's escalation of u s  forces may bring a temporary reduction in the violence in baghdad  at the price of increased u s  casualties   though the experience so far is not encouraging  but it cannot change the political dynamic in iraq  a phased withdrawal can moreover  until we change our approach in iraq  it will be increasingly difficult to refocus our efforts on the challenges in the wider region   on the conflict in the middle east  where hamas and hezbollah feel emboldened and israel's prospects for a secure peace seem uncertain  on iran  which has been strengthened by the war in iraq  and on afghanistan  where more american forces are needed to battle al qaeda  track down osama bin laden  and stop that country from backsliding toward instability burdened by iraq  our lackluster diplomatic efforts leave a huge void  our interests are best served when people and governments from jerusalem and amman to damascus and tehran understand that america will stand with our friends  work hard to build a peaceful middle east  and refuse to cede the future of the region to those who seek perpetual conflict and instability  such effective diplomacy cannot be done on the cheap  nor can it be warped by an ongoing occupation of iraq  instead  it will require patient  sustained effort  and the personal commitment of the president of the united states  that is a commitment i intend to make the second way america will lead again is by building the first truly  st century military and showing wisdom in how we deploy it we must maintain the strongest  best equipped military in the world in order to defeat and deter conventional threats  but while sustaining our technological edge will always be central to our national security  the ability to put boots on the ground will be critical in eliminating the shadowy terrorist networks we now face  this is why our country's greatest military asset is the men and women who wear the uniform of the united states this administration's first secretary of defense proudly acknowledged that he had inherited the greatest fighting force in the nation's history  six years later  he handed over a force that has been stretched to the breaking point  understaffed  and struggling to repair its equipment two thirds of the army is now rated  not ready  for combat    of the national guard is not ready to deploy overseas  and many units cannot respond to a domestic emergency our men and women in uniform are performing heroically around the world in some of the most difficult conditions imaginable  but the war in afghanistan and the ill advised invasion of iraq have clearly demonstrated the consequences of underestimating the number of troops required to fight two wars and defend our homeland  that's why i strongly support the expansion of our ground forces by adding   soldiers to the army and   marines but adding troops isn't just about meeting a quota  it's about recruiting the best and brightest to service  and it's about keeping them in service by providing them with the first rate equipment  armor  training  and incentives they deserve  it's about providing funding to enable the national guard to achieve an adequate state of readiness again  and it's about honoring our veterans by giving them the respect and dignity they deserve and the care and benefits they have earned a  st century military will also require us to invest in our men and women's ability to succeed in today's complicated conflicts  we know that on the streets of baghdad  a little bit of arabic can actually provide security to our soldiers  yet  just a year ago  less than   of the american military could speak a language such as arabic  mandarin  hindi  urdu  or korean  it's time we recognize these as critical skills for our military  and it's time we recruit and train for them former secretary rumsfeld said   you go to war with the army you have  not the one you want  i say that if the need arises when i'm president  the army we have will be the army we need of course  how we use our armed forces matters just as much as how they are prepared no president should ever hesitate to use force   unilaterally if necessary   to protect ourselves and our vital interests when we are attacked or imminently threatened  but when we use force in situations other than self defense  we should make every effort to garner the clear support and participation of others   the kind of burden sharing and support president george h w  bush mustered before he launched operation desert storm and when we do send our men and women into harm's way  we must also clearly define the mission  prescribe concrete political and military objectives  seek out advice of our military commanders  evaluate the intelligence  plan accordingly  and ensure that our troops have the resources  support  and equipment they need to protect themselves and fulfill their mission we must take these steps with the knowledge that while sometimes necessary  force is the costliest weapon in the arsenal of american power in terms of lives and treasure  and it's far from the only measure of our strength in order to advance our national security and our common security  we must call on the full arsenal of american power and ingenuity  to constrain rogue nations  we must use effective diplomacy and muscular alliances  to penetrate terrorist networks  we need a nimble intelligence community   with strong leadership that forces agencies to share information  and invests in the tools  technologies and human intelligence that can get the job done  to maintain our influence in the world economy  we need to get our fiscal house in order  and to weaken the hand of hostile dictators  we must free ourselves from our oil addiction  none of these expressions of power can supplant the need for a strong military  instead  they complement our military  and help ensure that the use of force is not our sole available option the third way america must lead again is by marshalling a global effort to meet a threat that rises above all others in urgency   securing  destroying  and stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction as leaders from henry kissinger to george shultz to bill perry to sam nunn have all warned  the actions we are taking today on this issue are simply not adequate to the danger there are still about   tons of highly enriched uranium   some of it poorly secured   at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries around the world  in the former soviet union  there are still about   to   nuclear weapons and stockpiles of uranium and plutonium capable of making another   weapons scattered across   time zones  and people have already been caught trying to smuggle nuclear materials to sell them on the black market we can do something about this  as president  i will lead a global effort to secure all nuclear weapons and material at vulnerable sites within four years   the most effective way to prevent terrorists from acquiring a bomb we know that russia is neither our enemy nor close ally right now  and we shouldn't shy away from pushing for more democracy  transparency  and accountability in that country  but we also know that we can and must work with russia to make sure every one of its nuclear weapons and every cache of nuclear material is secured  and we should fully implement the law i passed with senator dick lugar that would help the united states and our allies detect and stop the smuggling of weapons of mass destruction throughout the world while we work to secure existing stockpiles of nuclear material  we should also negotiate a verifiable global ban on the production of new nuclear weapons material as starting points  the world must prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and work to eliminate north korea's nuclear weapons program  if america does not lead  these two nations could trigger regional arms races that could accelerate nuclear proliferation on a global scale and create dangerous nuclear flashpoints  in pursuit of this goal  we must never take the military option off the table  but our first line of offense here must be sustained  direct and aggressive diplomacy  for north korea  that means ensuring the full implementation of the recent agreement  for iran  it means getting the un security council  europe  and the gulf states to join with us in ratcheting up the economic pressure we must also dissuade other countries from joining the nuclear club  just the other day  it was reported that nearly a dozen countries in and around the middle east  including syria and saudi arabia   are interested in pursuing nuclear power countries should not be able to build a weapons program under the auspices of developing peaceful nuclear power  that's why we should create an international fuel bank to back up commercial fuel supplies so there's an assured supply and no more excuses for nations like iran to build their own enrichment plants  it's encouraging that the nuclear threat initiative  backed by warren buffett  has already offered funding for this fuel bank  if matched two to one  but on an issue of this importance  the united states should not leave the solution to private philanthropies  it should be a central component of our national security  and that's why we should provide   million to get this fuel bank started and urge other nations  starting with russia  to join us finally  if we want the world to deemphasize the role of nuclear weapons  the united states and russia must lead by example  president bush once said   the united states should remove as many weapons as possible from high alert  hair trigger status   another unnecessary vestige of cold war confrontation  six years later  president bush has not acted on this promise  i will  we cannot and should not accept the threat of accidental or unauthorized nuclear launch  we can maintain a strong nuclear deterrent to protect our security without rushing to produce a new generation of warheads the danger of nuclear proliferation reminds us of how critical global cooperation will be in the  st century  that's why the fourth way america must lead is to rebuild and construct the alliances and partnerships necessary to meet common challenges and confront common threats in the wake of the second world war  it was america that largely built a system of international institutions that carried us through the cold war  leaders like harry truman and george marshall knew that instead of constraining our power  these institutions magnified it today it's become fashionable to disparage the united nations  the world bank  and other international organizations  in fact  reform of these bodies is urgently needed if they are to keep pace with the fast moving threats we face  such real reform will not come  however  by dismissing the value of these institutions  or by bullying other countries to ratify changes we have drafted in isolation  real reform will come because we convince others that they too have a stake in change   that such reforms will make their world  and not just ours  more secure our alliances also require constant management and revision if they are to remain effective and relevant  for example  over the last   years  nato has made tremendous strides in transforming from a cold war security structure to a dynamic partnership for peace today  nato's challenge in afghanistan has become a test case  in the words of dick lugar  of whether the alliance can  overcome the growing discrepancy between nato's expanding missions and its lagging capabilities we must close this gap  rallying members to contribute troops to collective security operations  urging them to invest more in reconstruction and stabilization  streamlining decision making processes  and giving commanders in the field more flexibility and as we strengthen nato  we should also seek to build new alliances and relationships in other regions important to our interests in the  st century  in asia  the emergence of an economically vibrant  more politically active china offers new opportunities for prosperity and cooperation  but also poses new challenges for the united states and our partners in the region  it is time for the united states to take a more active role here   to build on our strong bilateral relations and informal arrangements like the six party talks  as president  i intend to forge a more effective regional framework in asia that will promote stability  prosperity and help us confront common transnational threats such as tracking down terrorists and responding to global health problems like avian flu in this way  the security alliances and relationships we build in the  st century will serve a broader purpose than preventing the invasion of one country by another  they can help us meet challenges that the world can only confront together  like the unprecedented threat of global climate change this is a crisis that cannot be contained to one corner of the globe  studies show that with each degree of warming  rice yields   the world's most significant crop   fall by   by   famine could displace more than   million people worldwide  that means people competing for food and water in the next fifty years in the very places that have known horrific violence in the last fifty  africa  the middle east  south asia as the world's largest producers of greenhouse gases  america has the greatest responsibility to lead here  we must enact a cap and trade system that will dramatically reduce our carbon emissions  and we must finally free ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil by raising our fuel standards and harnessing the power of biofuels such steps are not just environmental priorities  they are critical to our security  america must take decisive action in order to more plausibly demand the same effort from others  we should push for binding and enforceable commitments to reduce emissions by the nations which pollute the most   the united states  the european union  russia  china  and india together account for nearly two thirds of current emissions  and we should help ensure that growth in developing countries is fueled by low carbon energy   the market for which could grow to   billion by   and spur the next wave of american entrepreneurship the fifth way america will lead again is to invest in our common humanity   to ensure that those who live in fear and want today can live with dignity and opportunity tomorrow a recent report detailed al qaeda's progress in recruiting a new generation of leaders to replace the ones we have captured or killed  the new recruits come from a broader range of countries than the old leadership   from afghanistan to chechnya  from britain to germany  from algeria to pakistan  most of these recruits are in their early thirties they operate freely in the disaffected communities and disconnected corners of our interconnected world   the impoverished  weak and ungoverned states that have become the most fertile breeding grounds for transnational threats like terror and pandemic disease and the smuggling of deadly weapons some of these terrorist recruits may have always been destined to take the path they did   accepting a tragically warped view of their religion in which god rewards the killing of innocents  but millions of young men and women have not last summer i visited the horn of africa's combined joint task force  which was headquartered at camp lemonier in djibouti  it's a u s  base that was set up four years ago  originally as a place to launch counter terrorism operations  but recently  a major focus of the task force has been working with our diplomats and aid workers on operations to win hearts and minds  while i was there  i also took a helicopter ride with admiral hunt  the commander of the task force  to dire dawa  where the u s  was helping provide food and water to ethiopians who had been devastated by flooding one of the navy captains who helps run the base recently told a reporter   our mission is at least   percent civil affairs  it's trying to get at the root causes of why people want to take on the u s '' the admiral now in charge of the task force suggested that if they can provide dignity and opportunity to the people in that region  then   the chance of extremism being welcomed greatly  if not completely  diminishes we have heard much over the last six years about how america's larger purpose in the world is to promote the spread of freedom   that it is the yearning of all who live in the shadow of tyranny and despair i agree  but this yearning is not satisfied by simply deposing a dictator and setting up a ballot box  the true desire of all mankind is not only to live free lives  but lives marked by dignity and opportunity  by security and simple justice delivering on these universal aspirations requires basic sustenance like food and clean water  medicine and shelter  it also requires a society that is supported by the pillars of a sustainable democracy   a strong legislature  an independent judiciary  the rule of law  a vibrant civil society  a free press  and an honest police force  it requires building the capacity of the world's weakest states and providing them what they need to reduce poverty  build healthy and educated communities  develop markets  and generate wealth  and it requires states that have the capacity to fight terrorism  halt the proliferation of deadly weapons  and build the health care infrastructure needed to prevent and treat such deadly diseases as hiv aids and malaria as president  i will double our annual investments in meeting these challenges to   billion by   and ensure that those new resources are directed towards these strategic goals for the last twenty years  u s  foreign aid funding has done little more than keep pace with inflation  doubling our foreign assistance spending by   will help meet the challenge laid out by tony blair at the   g  conference at gleneagles  and it will help push the rest of the developed world to invest in security and opportunity  as we have seen recently with large increases in funding for our aids programs  we have the capacity to make sure this funding makes a real difference part of this new funding will also establish a two billion dollar global education fund that calls on the world to join together in eliminating the global education deficit  similar to what the   commission proposed  because we cannot hope to shape a world where opportunity outweighs danger unless we ensure that every child  everywhere  is taught to build and not to destroy i know that many americans are skeptical about the value of foreign aid today  but as the u s  military made clear in camp lemonier  a relatively small investment in these fragile states up front can be one of the most effective ways to prevent the terror and strife that is far more costly   both in lives and treasure   down the road  in this way    billion a year in foreign aid   which is less than one half of one percent of our gdp   doesn't sound as costly when you consider that last year  the pentagon spent nearly double that amount in iraq alone finally  while america can help others build more secure societies  we must never forget that only the citizens of these nations can sustain them  the corruption i heard about while visiting parts of africa has been around for decades  but the hunger to eliminate such corruption is a growing and powerful force among people there  and so in these places where fear and want still thrive  we must couple our aid with an insistent call for reform we must do so not in the spirit of a patron  but the spirit of a partner   a partner that is mindful of its own imperfections  extending an outstretched hand to these states must ultimately be more than just a matter of expedience or even charity  it must be about recognizing the inherent equality and worth of all people  and it's about showing the world that america stands for something   that we can still lead these are the ways we will answer the challenge that arrived on our shores that september morning more than five years ago  a  st century military to stay on the offense  from djibouti to kandahar  global efforts to keep the world's deadliest weapons out of the world's most dangerous hands  stronger alliances to share information  pool resources  and break up terrorist networks that operate in more than eighty countries  and a stronger push to defeat the terrorists' message of hate with an agenda for hope around the world it's time we had a president who can do this again   who can speak directly to the world  and send a message to all those men and women beyond our shores who long for lives of dignity and security that says  you matter to us  your future is our future  and our moment is now it's time  as well  for a president who can build a consensus at home for this ambitious but necessary course  for in the end  no foreign policy can succeed unless the american people understand it and feel a stake in its success   and unless they trust that their government hears their more immediate concerns as well  after all  we will not be able to increase foreign aid if we fail to invest in security and opportunity for our own people  we cannot negotiate trade agreements to help spur development in poor countries so long as we provide no meaningful help to working americans burdened by the dislocations of a global economy  we cannot expect americans to support placing our men and women in harm's way if we cannot prove that we will use force wisely and judiciously but if the next president can restore the american people's trust   if they know that he or she is acting with their best interests at heart  with prudence and wisdom and some measure of humility   then i believe the american people will be ready to see america lead again they will be ready to show the world that we are not a country that ships prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries  that we are not a country that runs prisons which lock people away without ever telling them why they are there or what they are charged with  that we are not a country which preaches compassion and justice to others while we allow bodies to float down the streets of a major american city that is not who we are america is the country that helped liberate a continent from the march of a madman  we are the country that told the brave people of a divided city that we were berliners too  we sent generations of young people to serve as ambassadors for peace in countries all over the world  and we're the country that rushed aid throughout asia for the victims of a devastating tsunami now it's our moment to lead   our generation's time to tell another great american story  so someday we can tell our children that this was the time when we helped forge peace in the middle east  that this was the time when we confronted climate change and secured the weapons that could destroy the human race  this was the time when we brought opportunity to those forgotten corners of the world  and this was the time when we renewed the america that has led generations of weary travelers from all over the world to find opportunity  and liberty  and hope on our doorstep one of these travelers was my father  i barely knew him  but when  after his death  i finally took my first trip to his tiny village in kenya and asked my grandmother if there was anything left from him  she opened a trunk and took out a stack of letters  which she handed to me there were more than thirty of them  all handwritten by my father  all addressed to colleges and universities across america  all filled with the hope of a young man who dreamed of more for his life it is because someone in this country answered that prayer that i stand before you today with faith in our future  confidence in our story  and a determination to do my part in writing our country's next great chapter the american moment has not passed  the american moment is here  and like generations before us  we will seize that moment  and begin the world anew  thank you "], ["obama1", "it has now been a little over two months since we began this campaign  in that time we have traveled all across this country  and before every event we do  i usually have a minute to sit quietly and collect my thoughts  and recently  i've found myself reflecting on what it was that led me to public service in the first place  i live in chicago now  but i am not a native of that great city  i moved there when i was just a year out of college  and a group of churches offered me a job as a community organizer so i could help rebuild neighborhoods that had been devastated by the closing of steel plants  the salary was   a year plus enough money to buy an old  beat up car  and so i took the job and drove out to chicago  where i didn't know a soul  and during the time i was there  we worked to set up job training programs for the unemployed and after school programs for kids  and it was the best education i ever had  because i learned in those neighborhoods that when ordinary people come together  they can achieve extraordinary things  after three years  i went back to law school  i left there with a degree and a lifetime of debt  but i turned down the corporate job offers so i could come back to chicago and organize a voter registration drive  i also started a civil rights practice  and began to teach constitutional law  and after a few years  people started coming up to me and telling me i should run for state senate  so i did what every man does when he's faced with a big decision   i prayed  and i asked my wife  and after consulting those two higher powers  i decided to get in the race  and everywhere i'd go  i'd get two questions  first  they'd ask   where'd you get that funny name  barack obama  because people just couldn't pronounce it  they'd call me  alabama  or they'd call me  yo mama  and i'd tell them that my father was from kenya  and that's where i got my name  and my mother was from kansas  and that's where i got my accent from  and the second thing people would ask me was   you seem like a nice young man  you've done all this great work  you've been a community organizer  and you teach law school  you're a civil rights attorney  you're a family man   why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics  and i understand the question  and the cynicism  we all understand it  we understand it because we get the sense today that politics has become a business and not a mission  in the last several years  we have seen washington become a place where keeping score of who's up and who's down is more important than who's working on behalf of the american people  we have been told that our mounting debts don't matter  that the economy is doing great  and so americans should be left to face their anxiety about rising health care costs and disappearing pensions on their own  we've been told that climate change is a hoax  that our broken schools cannot be fixed  that we are destined to send millions of dollars a day to mideast dictators for their oil  and we've seen how a foreign policy based on bluster and bombast can lead us into a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged  and when we try to have an honest debate about the crises we face  whether it's on the senate floor or a sunday talk show  the conversation isn't about finding common ground  it's about finding someone to blame  we're divided into red states and blue states  and told to always point the finger at somebody else   the other party  or gay people  or immigrants  for good reason  the rest of us have become cynical about what politics can achieve in this country  and as we've turned away in frustration  we know what's filled the void  the lobbyists and influence peddlers with the cash and the connections   the ones who've turned government into a game only they can afford to play  they write the checks and you get stuck with the bills  they get the access while you get to write a letter  they think they own this government  but we're here to tell them it's not for sale  people tell me i haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of washington  but i promise you this   i've been there long enough to know that the ways of washington must change  i'm running for president because the time for the can't do  won't do  won't even try style of politics is over  it's time to turn the page  there is an awakening taking place in america today  from new hampshire to california  from texas to iowa  we are seeing crowds we've never seen before  we're seeing people showing up to the very first political event of their lives  they're coming because they know we are at a crossroads right now  because we are facing a set of challenges we haven't seen in a generation   and if we don't meet those challenges  we could end up leaving our children a world that's a little poorer and a little meaner than we found it  and so the american people are hungry for a different kind of politics   the kind of politics based on the ideals this country was founded upon  the idea that we are all connected as one people  that we all have a stake in one another  it's what i learned as a state senator in illinois  that you can turn the page on old debates  that it's possible to compromise so long as you as you never compromise your principles  and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other  we can assume the best in people instead of the worst  that's how we were able to reform a death penalty system that sent   innocent people to death row  that's how we were able to give health insurance to   more children who needed it  that's how we gave   million worth of tax cuts to working families in illinois  and that's how we passed the first ethics reform in twenty five years  we have seen too many campaigns where our problems are talked to death  where ten point plans are crushed under the weight of the same old politics once the election's over  where experience in washington doesn't always translate to results for the american people  and so if we do not change our politics   if we do not fundamentally change the way washington works   then the problems we've been talking about for the last generation will be the same ones that haunt us for generations to come  we must find a way to come together in this country   to realize that the responsibility we have to one another as americans is greater than the pursuit of any ideological agenda or corporate bottom line  democrats of california  it's time to turn the page  it's time to turn the page on health care   to bring together unions and businesses  democrats and republicans  and to let the insurance and drug companies know that while they get a seat at the table  they don't get to buy every chair  when i am president  i will sign a universal health care law by the end of my first term  my plan will cover the uninsured by letting people buy into the same kind of health care plan that members of congress give themselves  it will bring down costs by investing in information technology  and preventative care  and by stopping the drug companies from price gouging when patients need their medicine  it will help business and families shoulder the burden of catastrophic care so that an illness doesn't lead to a bankruptcy  and it will save the average family a thousand dollars a year on their premiums  we can do this  it's time to turn the page on education   to move past the slow decay of indifference that says some schools can't be fixed and some kids just can't learn  as president  i will launch a campaign to recruit and support hundreds of thousands of new teachers across the country  because the most important part of any education is the person standing in the front of the classroom  it's time to treat teaching like the profession it is   paying teachers what they deserve and working with them   not against them   to develop the high standards we need  we can do this  it's time to turn the page on energy   to break the political stalemate that's kept our fuel efficiency standards in the same place for twenty years  to tell the oil and auto industries that they must act  not only because their future's at stake  but because the future of our country and our planet is at stake as well  as president  i will institute a cap and trade system that would dramatically reduce carbon emissions and auction off emissions credits that would generate millions of dollars to invest in renewable sources of energy  i'll put in place a low carbon fuel standard like you have here in california that will take   million cars' worth of pollution off the road  and i'd raise the fuel efficiency standards for our cars and trucks because we know we have the technology to do it and it's time we did  we can do this  we can do all of this  but most of all  we have to turn the page on this disaster in iraq and restore our standing in the world  i am proud that i stood up in   and urged our leaders not to take us down this dangerous path  and so many of you did the same  even when it wasn't popular to do so  we knew back then this war was a mistake  we knew back then that it was dangerous diversion from the struggle against the terrorists who attacked us on september  th  we knew back then that we could find ourselves in an occupation of undetermined length  at undetermined cost  with undetermined consequences  but the war went forward  and now  we've seen those consequences and we mourn for the dead and wounded  i was in new hampshire the other week when a woman told me that her nephew was leaving for iraq  and as she started telling me how much she'd miss him and how worried she was about him  she began to cry  and she said to me   i can't breathe  i want to know  when am i going to be able to breathe again  it is time to let this woman know she can breathe again  it is time to put an end this war  the majority of both houses of the american congress   republicans and democrats   just passed a bill that would do exactly that  it's a bill similar to the plan i introduced in january that says there is no military solution to this civil war   that the last  best hope to pressure the warring factions to reach a political settlement is to let the iraqi government know that america will not be there forever   to begin a phased withdrawal with the goal of bringing all combat brigades home by march  st    we are one signature away from ending this war  if the president refuses to sign it  we will go back and find the sixteen votes we need to end this war without him  we will turn up the pressure on all those republican congressmen and senators who refuse to acknowledge the reality that the american people know so well  and we will get this done  we will bring our troops home  it's time to turn the page  it's time to show the world that america is still the last  best hope of earth  this president may occupy the white house  but for the last six years the position of leader of the free world has remained open  it's time to fill that role once more  whether it's terrorism or climate change  global aids or the spread of weapons of mass destruction  america cannot meet the threats of this new century alone  but the world cannot meet them without america  it's time for us to lead  it's time for us to show the world that we are not a country that ships prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries  that we are not a country that runs prisons which lock people away without ever telling them why they are there or what they are charged with  we are not a country which preaches compassion to others while we allow bodies to float down the streets of a major american city  that is not who we are  we are america  we are the nation that liberated a continent from a madman  that lifted ourselves from the depths of depression  that won civil rights  and women's rights  and voting rights for all our people  we are the beacon that has led generations of weary travelers to find opportunity  and liberty  and hope on our doorstep  that's who we are  i was down in selma  alabama awhile back  and we were celebrating the  nd anniversary of the march across the edmund pettus bridge  it was a march of ordinary americans   maids and cooks  preachers and pullman porters who faced down fire hoses and dogs  tear gas and billy clubs when they tried to get to the other side  but every time they were stopped  every time they were knocked down  they got back up  they came back  and they kept on marching  and finally they crossed over  it was called bloody sunday  and it was the culmination of the civil rights movement  when i came back from that celebration  people would say  oh  what a wonderful celebration of african american history that must have been  and i would say  no  that wasn't african american history  that was a celebration of american history   it's our story  and it reminds us of a simple truth   a truth i learned all those years ago as an organizer in chicago   a truth you carry by being here today   that in the face of impossible odds  people who love their country can change it  i am confident about my ability to lead this country  but i also know that i can't do it without you  there will be times when i get tired  there will be times when i make a mistake   it's true  talk to my wife  she'll tell you  but this campaign that we're running has to be about your hopes  and your dreams  and what you will do  because there are few obstacles that can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change  that's how change has always happened   not from the top down  but from the bottom up  and that's exactly how you and i will change this country  california  if you want a new kind of politics  it's time to turn the page  if you want an end to the old divisions  and the stale debates  and the score keeping and the name calling  it's time to turn the page  if you want health care for every american and a world class education for all our children  if you want energy independence and an end to this war in iraq  if you believe america is still that last  best hope of earth  then it's time to turn the page  it's time to turn the page for hope  it's time to turn the page for justice  it is time to turn the page and write the next chapter in the great american story  let's begin the work  let's do this together  let's turn that page  thank you   em as prepared em "], ["obama1", "it is an honor to be here at southern university  it is a privilege to stand with so many of our leading mayors from across this country  whether it's a small town or a big city  the government that's closest to the people is the one the people count on the most our mayors are on the frontlines when it comes to housing  education  job creation  and finding new ways to strengthen our families and communities  they are some of the hardest working people in america and when a disaster strikes  a katrina  a shooting  or a six alarm blaze   it's city hall we lean on  it's city hall we call first  and it's city hall we depend on to get us through the tough times last weekend  i attended a service to commemorate the  th anniversary of the la riots  after a jury acquitted   police officers of beating rodney king   a beating that was filmed and flashed around the world   los angeles erupted  i remember the sense of despair and powerlessness in watching one of america's greatest cities engulfed in flames but i want to start today with an inspiring story from that tragic event   a story about a baby who was born into this world with a bullet in its arm we learned about this child from a doctor named andy moosa  he was working the afternoon shift on april   at st  francis medical center in lynwood as the second day of violence was exploding in the streets  he told us about a pregnant woman who had been wearing a white dress  she was in compton and on her way to the supermarket  where the bullet came from nobody knew  her sister in law noticed a red spot in the middle of her white dress and said that i think you've been shot  the bullet had gone in  but it had not exited  the doctor described the ultrasound and how he realized that the bullet was in the baby  the doctor said   we could tell it was lodged in one of the upper limbs  we needed to get this baby out so we were in the delivery room and here's the thing  the baby looked great  except for the swelling in the right elbow in the fleshy part  it hadn't even fractured a bone  the bullet had lodged in the soft tissue in the muscle  the baby was fine  it was breathing and crying and kicking  they removed the bullet  stitched up the baby's arm  and everything was fine  the doctor went on to say that there's always going to be a scar to remind that child how quickly she came into the world in very unusual circumstances let's think about that story  there's always going to be a scar there  that doesn't go away  you take the bullet out  you stitch up the wound and   years later  there's still going to be a scar many of the students in this room were just learning to read and write when the riot started and tragedy struck the corner of florence and normandy  most of the mayors here know that those riots didn't erupt over night  there had been a  quiet riot  building up in los angeles and across this country for years  if you had gone to any street corner in chicago or baton rouge or selma or trenton or arcola  mississippi   you would have found the same young men and women without hope  without prospects  and without a sense of destiny other than life on the edge   the edge of the law  the edge of the economy  the edge of family structures and communities  those  quiet riots  that take place every day are born from the same place as the fires and the destruction and the police decked out in riot gear and the deaths  they happen when a sense of disconnect settles in and hope dissipates  despair takes hold and young people all across this country look at the way the world is and believe that things are never going to get any better  you tell yourself  my school will always crumble  there will never be a good job waiting for me to excel at  there will never be a place that i can be proud of and i can afford to call my home  that despair quietly simmers and makes it impossible to build strong communities and neighborhoods  and then one afternoon a jury says   not guilty    or a hurricane hits   and that despair is revealed for the world to see much of what we saw on our television screens   years ago was los angeles expressing a lingering  ongoing  pervasive legacy   a tragic legacy out of the tragic history this country has never fully come to terms with  this is not to excuse the violence of bashing in a man's head or destroying someone's store and their life's work  that kind of violence is inexcusable and self defeating  it does  however  describe the reality of many communities around this country and it made me think about our cities and communities all around this country  how not only do we still have scars from that riot and the  quiet riots  that happen every day   but how in too many places we haven't even taken the bullet out look at what happened in new orleans and along the gulf coast when katrina hit  people ask me whether i thought race was the reason the response was so slow  i said   no  this administration was colorblind in its incompetence  but everyone here knows the disaster and the poverty happened long before that hurricane hit  all the hurricane did was make bare what we ignore each and every day which is that there are whole sets of communities that are impoverished  that don't have meaningful opportunity  that don't have hope and they are forgotten  this disaster was a powerful metaphor for what's gone on for generations  in new orleans  the murder rate was one of the highest in the country   ten times the national average   well before the hurricane hit  young men died far more frequently from gunshot wounds than they did from anything else  the schools were failing long before the levees broke  the city's poverty rate was twice the national average  there was a reason why the evacuation failed and so many people were stranded on their roof tops  the folks who were making the plans assumed that people had cars that they could fill up with gas  put some perrier in the back  drive to a hotel  and check in with a credit card for a week of course  the federal response after katrina was similar to the response after the riots in los angeles  people in washington wake up and are surprised that there's poverty in our midst  and that others were frustrated and angry  then there are panels and there are hearings  there are commissions  there are reports  aid dollars are approved but they can't seem to get to the people  and then nothing really changes except the news coverage quiets down  this isn't to diminish the extraordinary generosity of the american people at the time  i want to thank the faculty and students here at southern university for turning your field house and dorms into shelters for so many in the aftermath of katrina  that act of kindness   the light in that storm   will never be forgotten  i want to thank the national conference of black mayors for their efforts  securing more   million in new market tax credits to assist with redevelopment  and creating your own disaster relief fund that helped   families in   gulf coast communities  but despite this extraordinary generosity  here we are   months later   or  years later in the case of la   and the homes haven't been built  the businesses haven't returned  and those same communities are still drowning and smoldering under the same hopelessness as before the tragedy hit it is time for us to come together and take the bullet out if we have more black men in prison than are in our colleges and universities  then it's time to take the bullet out  if we have almost   million people going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma that costs us half a billion dollars  it's time to take the bullet out  if one out of every nine kids doesn't have health insurance  it's time to take the bullet out  if we keep sending our kids to dilapidated school buildings  if we keep fighting this war in iraq  a war that never should have been authorized and waged  a war that's costing us   million dollars a day and the sacrifice of so many innocent lives   if we have all these challenges and nothing's changing  then every mayor in america needs to come together   form our own surgery teams   and take the bullets out  let's start with education we know what works  we know that if we put a dollar into early childhood education that we get seven dollars back in reduced drop out rates  reduced delinquency  reduced prison rates  more young people can go to college and get good jobs we know they work  an important study about an old program called abecedarian  in which children from low income families  almost all of them black  received full time educational child care from infancy through age   said kids were three times more likely to go to college  they were half as likely to become a teen parent and smoke marijuana  in another study about another effective program at the perry preschool  which served low income black children in michigan  kids needed special education less often  and they were three times as likely to own their own home and half as likely to go on welfare  that early childhood program even helped the next generation  so we know what it takes to improve our schools  we know that if children are learning in dilapidated buildings with teachers that are underpaid and textbooks that are   years old  they will not learn to change this  we need to fundamentally reform no child left behind  the slogan is right  but how the law has been implemented is wrong  the slogan is good  but how they left the money behind is wrong  let's get serious  let's finally make a quality education accessible to every american child so that every student can graduate from high school ready for college and work in a knowledge based economy to begin the great transformation in our schools  we need to invest in the most important part of a child's education  the man or woman standing at the head of the classroom  as president  i will recruit hundreds of thousands of new teachers and principals  for what it costs us to fund the iraq war for   days  we can recruit a new army of teachers and principals as president  i will recruit a new generation of science and technology leaders to teach our children the skills they will need to be competitive  we need to expand summer learning opportunities for our children emphasizing math and science  and students  who live in poverty  suffer from a learning disability or who don't speak english at home  should get the extra help they need and their schools need the resources to help their students reach their full potential i want to support teachers at all stages of their careers by increasing salaries across the board  improving incentives to get the best teachers to work in our rural areas and our most challenging cities  providing more resources so that teachers have more security and control over their classrooms  and by providing more opportunities for professional development there are models of excellence in many communities that show when you put a great teacher in a classroom  students can learn  there's murphy high school in mobile alabama and rufus king in milwaukee wisconsin  there's no shortage of great ideas  we just need to scale them up  we need to get past the old style of politics that only talks about education and start actually educating our kids for the  st century and while we're at it  let's do something for the young people ready for college  here at southern university in baton rouge  i'm sure that this won't come as a surprise when i say that college tuition rates are rising almost   percent a year  those increases have priced out more than   students in   and for what it costs to fund the iraq war for three weeks  we could provide each student with four years at a public college or university we all know how important education is  it's a passport to a better life  but millions of children are not given an equal chance to realize their own potential  and for too long  our kids   not  those kids  but our kids   have been asked to settle for mediocrity simply because of their zip code  the color of their skin  and how much their parents earn  this is wrong  we must change  we must take this bullet out if america is to remain the leading force for good and creativity and innovation in this world  but we can't stop at education if we want stronger communities  we need to provide economic opportunity in every corner of our country if we want to take the bullet out  we know what it takes to develop our communities economically  right now  the iraq war is set to cost us   trillion dollars   that's more than enough to lay broadband lines from   columbia south carolina to portland oregon  what good is the information super highway when too many towns and cities are still riding around in dial up  we must connect the disconnected so economic opportunity is there for everyone   not just everyone who can afford it  it might not stop certain jobs from being outsourced to india  but this national effort would create jobs over   jobs a year over the next two decades and improve our country's competitiveness we know that we have to invest in transitional jobs too  when there are people who are homeless  veterans struggling with post traumatic stress disorder from this war in iraq  and thousands of children aging out of foster care  we can't expect them to have all the skills they need for work  they may need help with basic skills   how to show up to work on time  wear the right clothes  and act appropriately in an office  we have to help them get there that's why i have called for   million to begin innovative new job training and workforce development programs  this plan will also provide mentoring opportunities and let case workers help men and women make difficult transitions  it will coordinate with local employers  community colleges  and community organizations so that job training programs are actually connected to good paying jobs with the opportunity for career growth  this would help lift more people out of poverty and into the middle class there are models all across this country for how for how we can rebuild our cities and communities  there's a new idea coming for the gulf coast and the new orleans area  congressman bennie thompson of mississippi  emanuel cleaver  the former mayor of kansas city and head of the national conference of black mayors  and other members of the congressional black caucus will soon introduce legislation that creates a gulf coast recovery and empowerment initiative  it will employ people who fled the region to rebuild the region  the houses  the businesses  roads and bridges  it will give people an incentive to move back home and put them back to work  that's the kind of leadership we need to take the bullet out if we want to create more jobs in our communities  let's stop sending   million a day to some of the most hostile nations on the planet and end our dependence on foreign oil  we don't have an energy policy right now  that's why we're funding both sides of the war on terror  melting the polar ice caps  and letting the old style of politics make sure that detroit doesn't produce more fuel efficient cars  and if we don't do something soon  more katrina's are going to happen and we know which communities will bear the brunt of those storms when it comes to global climate change and developing the fuels for the  st century  america must lead  i want our farmers to grow the renewable fuels and produce biofuels  i want us to lead the way on low carbon fuels  i want our young people to imagine and build the next great inventions  if we finally have a president who deals with this challenge  we could not only make our country safer  we could save the planet and create jobs throughout all our communities  we must meet this challenge  we must take the bullet out that's stopped our progress for all these years and bring more economic opportunities to every community  we can do this but while we're at it  what good is an education and a job  if there are only million dollar mansions and quarter million dollar condos and you can't afford a place to live  when our children are being priced out of the neighborhoods and towns they grew up in and when families cannot find safe places to live near their job  that's a bullet that's got to come out too we have to invest in housing again  in too many communities low income families are priced out of the housing market  in fact  there is not a single metropolitan area in the country where a family earning minimum wage can afford decent housing  we need to create an affordable housing trust fund that would create as much as   new affordable units in mixed income neighborhoods  we need to fully fund the community development block grant initiative  as a former community organizer on the south side of chicago  i know how critical those grants are and we have to do more to strengthen the partnership between the federal and local governments when it relates to housing programs like section   for all those seniors who lost their apartments when the hurricane hit  we can do this we must also do more to protect homeowners in this country  a recent report found that the housing market experienced its worst sales month in   years and foreclosures are up   compared to last year  right now  too many people are caught in a nightmare caused by mortgage fraud and predatory lending that is why my  stop fraud  proposals require mortgage professionals to report suspected fraudulent activity and support state and local law enforcement in their efforts to fight fraud  it addresses abuses in the subprime loan market where   million homeowners may be at risk of foreclosure  and it provides   million for housing counseling to tenants  homeowners  and other consumers so they get the advice and guidance they need before buying a house and support if they get in to trouble down the road even if we succeed in making housing and homeownership affordable for all  if we don't help strengthen the families that live inside those homes  then those bullets will make the american house crumble from the inside out  we have to do more to help families balance work and take care of one another  let's help   million children by extending the child tax credit to low income workers  let's stop spending   million a day in iraq and pass some tax cuts that people actually need if we want stronger families in america  then we have to confront the tough issues  when too many fathers think that responsibility ends at conception   when they have not yet realized that what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child but the courage to raise one  we know that our families are in crisis  that's a self inflicted wound we all have to help heal  now there are ways that the government can help  that's why i introduced the responsible fatherhood and healthy families act  it provides fathers with innovative job training services and increases access to the earned income tax credit  eitc  it calls for an increase in child support enforcement by almost   billion over   years  resulting in nearly   billion in collection  that money will go directly to children and their mothers  but let's be honest  government alone can't solve the breakdown of our families  this is something we have to look to ourselves so that fathers become parents too we know what the challenges are in small towns and big cities across this country  we know what those bullets are  we've talked about them for years  what's stopped us from meeting these challenges and taking these bullets out is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans  what's stopped us is the failure of leadership and absence of urgency and a belief that if we ignore our problems like discrimination and poverty that they will someone how go away  for the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter  we've been told that the anxiety americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion  we've been told that climate change is a hoax  and that tough talk and an ill conceived war can replace diplomacy  and strategy  and foresight  and when all else fails  when katrina happens  or the death toll in iraq mounts  we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault  we're distracted from our real failures  and told to blame the other party  or gay people  or immigrants that kind of politics has to stop  that kind of quackery has to stop  we don't need anymore faith healers and snake oil salesmen  we need some doctors to take the bullets out  before we can start that work  we need to end this war in iraq  which has cost our country and our people so much  i opposed it from the very start  back in   when it wasn't popular to be against this war  i opposed it because i believed strongly that it could lead to the disaster we find ourselves in today  with our brave young service men and women mired in the middle of a civil war this war never should have been authorized by congress and it never should have been waged  and it's time  once and for all  to bring our troops home  it's time to recognize that american soldiers can't solve iraq's political differences or ethnic rivalries that's why i introduced a plan in january that would have begun withdrawing our combat forces on may  st five days ago and would have brought them home by march  st  while forcing the iraqi government to meet its obligations and this is basically the plan the president vetoed this week  defying not just a majority of congress but the will of the american people  but rest assured  his veto was not the last word  if the president continues to stubbornly ignore the realities of iraq  we intend to force our colleagues in the senate and house to take vote after vote until we overcome his veto or he finally understands that we have to change course we need   republican votes in the senate to override a veto  there's a republican right here in louisiana who needs to vote to end the war  tomorrow i'll be in iowa and there's a senator there whose vote we need  i need the mayors and the students here to call their senators and congressman too  this is the only chance we have to truly end the war  it's not symbolic  this is real  sixteen votes and we can turn the page on this war  sixteen votes and we can start bringing our men and women home let me just close by saying this  we can only meet these challenges together  we can only take these bullets out together  we can only strengthen our cities and towns and in turn transform our nation  together  we know how the doctors do it  we watch some of these tv shows like er and gray's anatomy  the doctors are in the operating room  one's got the scalpel  but others are watching the monitors and administering the iv  the nurses are on the job  the orderlies are on the job  there was a team that got the bullet out of that baby girl   years ago  she's got a scar on her arm  always will  but she survived  america is going to survive  we won't forget where we came from  we won't forget what happened   months ago    years ago    years ago  we're going to pull out bullet after bullet  we're going to stitch up arm after arm  we're going to wear those scars for justice  we're going to usher in a new america the way that newborn child was ushered in  we're never going to forget there is always hope   there is always light in the midst of desperate days   that a baby can be born even with a bullet in her arm  and we can come together as one people and transform this nation "], ["obama1", "america is a country that hasn't come easily  in our brief history  we have been tested by revolution and slavery  war and depression  and great movements for social  civil  and equal rights we have emerged from each challenge stronger  more prosperous  and ever closer to the ideals of liberty and opportunity that lay at the heart of the american experiment and yet  the price of our progress has always been borne by the struggle and sacrifice of our people   by leaders who have asked ordinary americans to do extraordinary things  and by generations of men and women who've had the courage to answer that call it was the greatest of all generations that took up this charge in the days after the attack on pearl harbor  almost overnight  they were asked to transform a peacetime economy that was still climbing out from the depths of depression into an arsenal of democracy that could wage war across three continents  if you weren't heading overseas  you were heading into the factories   factories that had to be immediately retooled and reorganized to produce the world's greatest fighting machine many doubted whether this could be achieved in time  or even at all  president franklin roosevelt's own advisors told him that his goals for wartime production were unrealistic and impossible to meet  but the president simply waved them off  saying  believe me   the production people can do it if they really try and so the nation turned here  to detroit  with the hope that the motor city could lead the way in using its assembly lines to mass produce arms instead of automobiles  at first  the industry was skeptical about whether this was technologically possible or even profitable in the long run  but after repeated assurances from roosevelt and some help from the federal government  the arsenal began to churn in an astonishingly short period of time  the auto industry and its workers became one of the nation's most important contributors to the war effort  manufacturing more planes  tanks  bombs and weapons than the world had ever seen  the new york times declared that the automakers had achieved a  production miracle  and it labeled detroit  the miraculous city it was a miracle that was distinctly american   the idea that in the face of impossible odds  people who love their country can rise to meet its greatest challenges it's the kind of american miracle we need today at the dawn of the twenty first century  the country that faced down the tyranny of fascism and communism is now called to challenge the tyranny of oil  for the very resource that has fueled our way of life over the last hundred years now threatens to destroy it if our generation does not act now and act boldly we know what the dangers are here  we know that our oil addiction is jeopardizing our national security   that we fuel our energy needs by sending   million a day to countries that include some of the most despotic  volatile regimes in the world  we know that oil money funds everything from the madrassas that plant the seeds of terror in young minds to the sunni insurgents that attack our troops in iraq  it corrupts budding democracies  and gives dictators from venezuela to iran the power to freely defy and threaten the international community  it even presents a target for osama bin laden  who has told al qaeda to   focus your operations on oil  especially in iraq and the gulf area  since this will cause  the americans  to die off on their own we know that our oil dependency is jeopardizing our planet as well   that the fossil fuels we burn are setting off a chain of dangerous weather patterns that could condemn future generations to global catastrophe  we see the effects of global climate change in our communities and around the world in record drought  famine  and forest fires  hurricanes and typhoons are growing in intensity  and rapidly melting ice sheets in antarctica and greenland could raise global sea levels high enough to swallow up large portions of every coastal city and town and this city knows better than any what our oil addiction is doing to our economy  we are held hostage to the spot oil market   forced to watch our fortunes rise and fall with the changing price of every barrel  gas prices have risen to record levels  and could hit   a gallon in some cities this summer  here in detroit  three giants of american industry are hemorrhaging jobs and profits as foreign competitors answer the rising global demand for fuel efficient cars america simply cannot continue on this path  the need to drastically change our energy policy is no longer a debatable proposition  it is not a question of whether  but how  not a question of if  but when  for the sake of our security  our economy  our jobs and our planet  the age of oil must end in our time this is a challenge that has not been solved for a lack of talking  every single president since richard nixon has spoken in soaring rhetoric about the need to reduce america's energy dependence  and many have offered plans and policies to do so and yet  every year  that dependence keeps on growing  good ideas are crushed under the weight of typical washington politics  politicians are afraid to ask the oil and auto industries to do their part  and those industries hire armies of lobbyists to make sure it stays that way  autoworkers  understandably fearful of losing jobs  and wise to the tendency of having to pay the price of management's mistakes  join in the resistance to change  the rest of us whip ourselves into a frenzy whenever gas prices skyrocket or a crisis like katrina takes oil off the market  but once the headlines recede  so does our motivation to act there's a reason for this a clean  secure energy future will take another american miracle  it will require a historic effort on the scale of what we saw in those factories during world war ii  it will require tough choices by our government  sacrifice from our businesses  innovation from our brightest minds  and the sustained commitment of the american people it will also take leadership willing to turn the page on the can't do  won't do  won't even try politics of the past  leadership willing to face down the doubters and the cynics and simply say   believe me  we can do it if we really try i will be that kind of president   a president who believes again in america that can  a president who believes that when it comes to energy  the challenge may be great and the road may be long  but the time to act is now  who knows that we have the technology  we have the resources  and we are at a rare moment of growing consensus among democrats and republicans  unions and ceos  evangelical christians and military experts who understand that this must be our generation's next great task a comprehensive energy plan will require bold action on many fronts  to fully combat global climate change  we'll need a stringent cap on all carbon emissions and the creation of a global market that would make the development of low carbon technologies profitable and create thousands of new jobs  we'll also need to find a way to use coal   america's most abundant fossil fuel   without adding harmful greenhouse gases to the environment i have already endorsed a cap and trade system that would achieve real near term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and return america to a position of leadership so that we can secure an effective and equitable global solution to this crisis  it would invest substantial revenue generated by auctioning off emissions credits into the development of carbon sequestration  advanced biofuels  and energy efficiency we'll also need new ideas on energy efficiency and the ability to harness renewable sources of energy  because there is absolutely no reason we shouldn't be able to get at least   of our energy from clean and renewable sources by  i will be laying out more detailed proposals on each of these areas in the months to come  but here in detroit  i want to focus on a few proposals that would drastically reduce our oil dependence and our carbon emissions by focusing on two of their major causes   the cars we drive and the fuels we use  by   these proposals would save us   million barrels of oil per day   the equivalent of ending all oil imports from the middle east and removing   million cars' worth of pollution off the road it starts with our cars   because if we truly hope to end the tyranny of oil  the nation must once again turn to detroit for another great transformation i know these are difficult times for automakers  and i know that not all of the industry's problems are of its own making but we have to be honest about how we arrived at this point for years  while foreign competitors were investing in more fuel efficient technology for their vehicles  american automakers were spending their time investing in bigger  faster cars  and whenever an attempt was made to raise our fuel efficiency standards  the auto companies would lobby furiously against it  spending millions to prevent the very reform that could've saved their industry  even as they've shed thousands of jobs and billions in profits over the last few years  they've continued to reward failure with lucrative bonuses for ceos the consequences of these choices are now clear  while our fuel standards haven't moved from   miles per gallon in two decades  both china and japan have surpassed us  with japanese cars now getting an average of   miles to the gallon  and as the global demand for fuel efficient and hybrid cars have skyrocketed  it's foreign competitors who are filling the orders  just the other week  we learned that for the first time since   toyota has surpassed general motors as the world's best selling automaker at the dawn of the internet age  it was famously said that there are two kinds of businesses   those that use email and those that will  today  there are two kinds of car companies   those that mass produce fuel efficient cars and those that will the american auto industry can no longer afford to be one of those that will  what's more  america can't afford it  when the auto industry accounts for one in ten american jobs  we all have a stake in saving those jobs  when our economy  our security  and the safety of our planet depend on our ability to make cleaner  more fuel efficient cars  every american has a responsibility to make sure that happens automakers still refuse to make the transition to fuel efficient production because they say it's too expensive at a time when they're losing profits and struggling under the weight of massive health care costs this time  they're actually right  the auto industry's refusal to act for so long has left it mired in a predicament for which there is no easy way out but expensive is no longer an excuse for inaction  the auto industry is on a path that is unacceptable and unsustainable   for their business  for their workers  and for america  and america must take action to make it right that's why my first proposal will require automakers to meet higher fuel standards and produce more fuel efficient cars while providing them the flexibility and assistance to do it this is a proposal that's already brought together republicans and democrats  those who've long advocated increases in our fuel standards  and those who have opposed those increases for years  it enjoys the support of corporate leaders like fred smith of federal express who understand that our economy is at risk if we fail to act and military leaders like general p x  kelley who know all to well the human cost of our nation's addiction to oil it's a proposal that answers the concerns that many have previously had with raising fuel standards   that it's too expensive  or unsafe  or not achievable  and it's an approach that asks our government  our businesses  and our people to invest in a secure energy future   that recognizes we can make great cars and protect american jobs if we transform the auto industry so that our autoworkers can compete with world once more it begins by gradually raising our fuel economy standards by four percent   approximately one mile per gallon   each year  the national academy of sciences has already determined that we can begin to achieve this rate of improvement today  using existing technology and without changing a vehicle's weight or performance  and so the only way that automakers can avoid meeting this goal is if the national highway traffic and safety administration can prove that the increase is not safe  not cost effective  or not technologically possible this proposal provides additional flexibility to manufacturers as well  currently  domestic automakers are disadvantaged by the requirement that their fleets have to meet the same overall fuel standard as foreign manufacturers even though u s  companies sell a much broader array of vehicles  my approach would establish different fuel standards for different types of cars  this reform will level the playing field by requiring all car makers to achieve a similar rate of progress regardless of their vehicle mix  it will also allow manufacturers to get credit if they increase the fuel efficiency in one particular car beyond what the fuel economy standards require we also know that  absent some assistance  the significant costs associated with retooling parts and assembly plants could be prohibitive for companies that are already struggling and shedding workers  our goal is not to destroy the industry  but to help bring it into the  st century  so if the auto industry is prepared to step up to its responsibilities  we should be prepared to help that's why my proposal would provide generous tax incentives to help automakers upgrade their existing plants in order to accommodate the demands of producing more fuel efficient vehicles this approach would also strike a bargain with the auto industry on one of the biggest costs they face  we've heard for years that the spiraling cost of health care for retired autoworkers constrains manufacturers from investing in more fuel efficient technology  we all know the statistic   health care costs currently account for   of every gm car  so here's the deal  we'll help to partially defray those health care costs  but only if the manufacturers are willing to invest the savings right back into the production of more fuel efficient cars and trucks finally  we should make it easier for the american people to buy more fuel efficient cars by providing more tax credits to more consumers for the purchase of hybrid and ultra efficient vehicles  but we should also realize that the more choices we have as consumers  the more responsibility we have to buy these cars   to realize that a few hundred extra dollars for a hybrid is the price we pay as citizens committed to a cause bigger than ourselves for too long  we've been either too afraid to ask our automakers to meet higher fuel standards or unwilling to help them do it  but the truth is  if we hope for another miracle out of detroit  we have to do both  we must demand that they revamp their production  we must assist that transition  and we must make the choice to buy these cars when we have the option  all of us have a responsibility here  and all of us are required to act now it's not enough to only build cars that use less oil   we also have to start moving away from that dirty  dwindling fossil fuel altogether  that's why my second proposal will create a market for clean burning  home grown biofuels like ethanol that can replace the oil we use and begin to slow the damage caused by global climate change the potential for biofuels in this country is vast  farmers who grow them know that  entrepreneurs and fueling station owners who want to sell them know that  scientists and environmentalists who study the atmosphere know it too it's time we produced  sold  and used biofuels all across america   it's time we made them as commonly available as gasoline is now i've already done some of this work in the u s  senate by helping to provide tax credits to those who want to sell a mix of ethanol and gasoline known as e  at their fueling stations  and since it only costs   per vehicle to install a flexible fuel tank that can run on biofuels  i've also proposed that we help pay for this transition government should lead the way here  i showed up at this event in a government vehicle that does not have a flexible fuel tank  when i'm president  i will make sure that every vehicle purchased by the federal government does of course  to truly overcome the lack of a biofuel infrastructure in this country  we need to create a market for the production of more biofuels like the auto industry  the oil industry has generally been resistant to making the transition from petroleum to biofuels   with some even trying to block the installation of e  pumps at fueling stations to overcome this resistance and create this infrastructure  i've introduced a proposal known as a national low carbon fuel standard  based on the one introduced by governor arnold schwarzenegger in california just a few months ago  like raising our fuel efficiency standards  this approach simultaneously reduces our dependence on oil and reduces greenhouse gas emissions the idea behind the standard is simple beginning in   we will require petroleum makers to reduce the carbon content of their fuel mix one percent per year by selling more clean  alternative fuels in its place  this proposal will spur greater production and availability of renewable fuels like cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel  and it will even create an incentive for the production of more flexible fuel and plug in hybrid vehicles that can use these clean fuels or charge up with renewable electricity this approach will also allow the market  not the government  to determine which fuels are used by fuel distributors to meet the standard  it's gradual  so it gives these companies time to meet the requirements  and if you're a fuel producer that's having trouble meeting the standard  it allows you to pay for a credit from a company that is the low carbon fuel standard also provides a greater incentive for private sector investment in the cleanest biofuels possible  corn based ethanol has led the way here  and now we need to expand the universe of biofuels to include cellulosic ethanol made from switchgrass or forest waste that can reduce our carbon footprint even further in the end  the two major proposals i outlined today   higher fuel efficiency standards and a national low carbon fuel standard   will not end our oil dependence entirely but the transformation of the cars we drive and the fuels we use would be the most ambitious energy project in decades  with results that would last for generations to come    million fewer barrels of oil per day    million cars' worth of pollution off the road by   the direct consumer savings at the pump in that year would be over   billion  not to mention the great economic benefits of a rejuvenated and fiercely competitive domestic auto industry some will say that the goals are too large  that the ask is too great  and that the political reality is too difficult for this to work to that i'd say that we've heard it all before  and we still believe we can do it if we really try  because that's who we are as americans  because that's who we've always been in the days and months after september  th  americans were waiting to be called to something larger than themselves  just like their parents and grandparents of the greatest generation  so many of us were willing to serve and defend our country   not only on the fields of war  but on the homefront too this is our generation's chance to answer that call  meeting the challenge posed by our oil dependence won't require us to build the massive war machine that franklin roosevelt called for so many years ago  but it will require the same sense of shared sacrifice and responsibility from all of us   not just the auto industry and its workers here in detroit  but oil companies in texas  power plants from new jersey to california  legislators in washington  and consumers in every american city and town  it's time for all of us to head back into the factories and universities  to the boardrooms and the halls of congress so we can roll up our sleeves and find a way to get this done  i am ready and willing to lead us there as your next president  and i hope you are willing to join me in the journey toward that next great american miracle  thank you "], ["obama1", "good morning  president leblanc  the board of trustees  faculty  parents  family  friends  and the class of   congratulations on your graduation  and thank you for allowing me the honor to be a part of it  i also want to thank southern new hampshire university for this honorary doctor of laws degree  i ended up paying for my first law degree for years and years  so for all of you with visions of law school  i'd consider running for president and then waiting for a commencement invite instead   it's much cheaper  there is a verse from the bible that is sometimes read or recited during rites of passage like this  corinthians    when i was a child  i spoke as a child  i felt as a child  i thought as a child  now that i have become a man  i have put away childish things  i bring this up because there's often an assumption on days like today that growing up is purely a function of age  that becoming an adult is an inevitable progression that can be measured by a series of milestones   college graduation or your first job or the first time you throw a party that actually has food too  and yet  maturity does not come from any one occasion   it emerges as a quality of character  because the fact is  i know a whole lot of thirty and forty and fifty year olds who have not yet put away childish things   who continually struggle to rise above the selfish or the petty or the small  we see this reflected in our country today  we see it in a politics that's become more concerned about who's up and who's down than who's working to solve the real challenges facing our generation  a politics where debates over war and peace are reduced to  second soundbites and  second attack ads  we see it in a media culture that sensationalizes the trivial and trivializes the profound   in a  hour news network bonanza that never fails to keep us posted on how many days paris hilton will spend in jail but often fails to update us on the continuing genocide in darfur or the recovery effort in new orleans or the poverty that plagues too many american streets  and as we're fed this steady diet of cynicism  it's easy to start buying into it and put off hard decisions  we become tempted to turn inward  suspicious that change is really possible  doubtful that one person really can make a difference  that's where the true test of growing up occurs  that's where you come in  no matter where you go from here   whether it's into public service or the business world  whether it's law school or medical school  whether you become scientists or artists or entertainers   you will face a choice  do you want to be passive observers of the way world is or active citizens in shaping the way the world ought to be  in both your own life and the life of your country  will you strive to put away childish things  it is a constant struggle  this quest for maturity  and as my wife will certainly tell you  i haven't always been on the winning side in my own life  but through my own tests and failings  i have learned a few lessons here and there about growing up  and there's three i'd like to leave you with today  the first lesson came during my first year in college  back then i had a tendency  in my mother's words  to act a bit casual about my future  i rebelled  angry in the way that many young men in general  and young black men in particular  are angry  thinking that responsibility and hard work were old fashioned conventions that didn't apply to me  i partied a little too much and studied just enough to get by  and once  after a particularly long night of partying  we had spilled a little too much beer  broke a few too many bottles  and trashed a little too much of the dorm  and the next day  the mess was so bad that when one of the cleaning ladies saw it  she began to tear up  and when a girlfriend of mine heard about this  she said to me   that woman could've been my grandmother  barack  she spent her days cleaning up after somebody else's mess  which drove home for me the first lesson of growing up  the world doesn't just revolve around you  there's a lot of talk in this country about the federal deficit  but i think we should talk more about our empathy deficit   the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes  to see the world through those who are different from us   the child who's hungry  the laid off steelworker  the immigrant woman cleaning your dorm room  as you go on in life  cultivating this quality of empathy will become harder  not easier  there's no community service requirement in the real world  no one forcing you to care  you'll be free to live in neighborhoods with people who are exactly like yourself  and send your kids to the same schools  and narrow your concerns to what's going in your own little circle  not only that   we live in a culture that discourages empathy  a culture that too often tells us our principle goal in life is to be rich  thin  young  famous  safe  and entertained  a culture where those in power too often encourage these selfish impulses  they will tell you that the americans who sleep in the streets and beg for food got there because they're all lazy or weak of spirit  that the inner city children who are trapped in dilapidated schools can't learn and won't learn and so we should just give up on them entirely  that the innocent people being slaughtered and expelled from their homes half a world away are somebody else's problem to take care of  i hope you don't listen to this  i hope you choose to broaden  and not contract  your ambit of concern  not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate  although you do have that obligation  not because you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are  although you do have that debt  it's because you have an obligation to yourself  because our individual salvation depends on collective salvation  and because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential   and become full grown  the second lesson i learned after college  when i had this crazy idea that i wanted to be a community organizer and work in low income neighborhoods  my mother and grandparents thought i should go to law school  my friends had applied for jobs on wall street  but i went ahead and wrote letters to every organization in the country that i could think of  and finally  this small group of churches on the south side of chicago wrote back and gave me a job organizing neighborhoods devastated by steel plant closings in the early  s  the churches didn't have much money   so they offered me a grand sum of   a year plus   to buy a car  and i got ready to move to chicago   a place i had never been and where i didn't know a living soul  even people who didn't know me were skeptical of my decision  i remember having a conversation with an older man i had met before i arrived in chicago  i told him about my plans  and he looked at me and said   let me tell something  you look like a nice clean cut young man  and you've got a nice voice  so let me give you a piece of advice   forget this community organizing business  you can't change the world  and people won't appreciate you trying  what you should do is go into television broadcasting  i'm telling you  you've got a future  i could've taken my mother's advice and i could've taken my grandparents advice  i could've taken the path my friends traveled  and objectively speaking  that older man had a point about the tv thing  but i knew there was something in me that wanted to try for something bigger  so the second lesson is this  challenge yourself  take some risks in your life  this isn't easy  in a few minutes  you can take your diploma  walk off this stage  and go chasing after the big house and the large salary and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should buy  but i hope you don't  focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a poverty of ambition  it asks too little of yourself  and it will leave you unfulfilled  so don't let people talk you into doing what's easy or comfortable  listen to what's inside of you and decide what it is that you care about so much that you're willing to risk it all  the third lesson is one that i learned once i got to chicago  i had spent weeks organizing our very first community meeting around the issue of gang violence  we invited the police  we made phone calls  went to churches  and passed out flyers  i had been warned of the turf battles and bad politics between certain community leaders  but i ignored them  confident that i knew what i was doing  the night of the meeting we arranged rows and rows of chairs in anticipation of the crowd  and we waited  and we waited  and finally  a group of older people walk in to the hall  and they sit down  and this little old lady raises her hand and asks   is this where the bingo game is  thirteen people showed up that night  the police never came  and the meeting was a complete disaster  later  the volunteers i worked with told me they were quitting   that they had been doing this for two years and had nothing to show for it  i was tired too  but at that point  i looked outside and saw some young boys playing in a vacant lot across the street  tossing stones at boarded up apartment building  and i turned to the volunteers  and i asked them   before you quit  i want you to answer one question  what's gonna happen to those boys  who will fight for them if not us  who will give them a fair shot if we leave  and at that moment  we were all reminded of a third lesson in growing up  persevere  making your mark on the world is hard  if it were easy  everybody would do it  but it's not  it takes patience  it takes commitment  and it comes with plenty of failure along the way  the real test is not whether you avoid this failure  because you won't  it's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction  or whether you learn from it  whether you choose to persevere  after my little speech that day  one by one  the volunteers decided not to quit  we went back to those neighborhoods  and we kept at it  sustaining ourselves with the small victories  eventually  over time  a community changed  and so had we  cultivating empathy  challenging yourself  persevering in the face of adversity   these are qualities that dare us to put away childish things  they are qualities that help us grow  they are qualities that one graduate today knows especially well  richard komi was born thousands of miles from here in southern nigeria  he'd probably still be there today  if he hadn't been forced to flee when his tribe came under attack  eventually  he made it to the united states  worked his way through factories and retail jobs  and came here to snhu  to complete the education he began in africa  and now  with a wife and kids and lots of responsibility  he's even taking the time to give back to his new country by volunteering on this campaign  richard komi may be graduating today  but it's clear that he grew up a long time ago  we celebrate with him because his journey is a testament to the powerful idea that in the face of impossible odds  ordinary people can do extraordinary things  at a time when america finds itself at a crossroads  facing challenges we haven't seen in decades  we need to hold on to this idea more than ever  a lot is riding on the decisions that are made and the leadership that is provided by this generation  we are counting on you to help fix a health care system that's leaving too many americans sick or bankrupt or both  we are counting on you to bring this planet back from the brink by solving this crisis of global climate change  we are counting on you to help stop a genocide in darfur that's taking the lives of innocents as we speak here today  and we're counting on you to restore the image of america around the world that has led so many like richard komi to find liberty  and opportunity  and hope on our doorstep  there are some who are betting against you   who say that you don't pay attention  that you don't show up to vote  that you're too concerned with your own lives and your own problems  well that's not what i believe and it's not what i've seen  instead i've seen rallies filled with crowds that stretch far into the horizon  thousands upon thousands signing up to organize online  scores who are coming to the very first political event of their lifetime  and just a few hours before this commencement  i got the opportunity to send off hundreds of people who have chosen to take time out of their busy lives and spend an entire saturday knocking on doors here in new hampshire  because they're not content to sit back and watch anymore  because they believe they can help this country grow  and whenever the doubt creeps in and i find myself wondering if change is really possible  i end up thinking about the young americans   teenagers and college kids not much older than you   who watched the civil rights movement unfold before them on television sets all across the country  i imagine that they would've seen the marchers and heard the speeches  but they also probably saw the dogs and the fire hoses  or the footage of innocent people being beaten within an inch of their lives  or heard the news the day those four little girls died when someone threw a bomb into their church  instinctively  they knew that it was safer and smarter to stay at home  to watch the movement from afar  but they also understood that these people in georgia and alabama and mississippi were their brothers and sisters  that what was happening was wrong  and that they had an obligation to make it right  when the buses pulled up for a freedom ride down south  they got on  they took a risk  and they changed the world  now it's your turn  you will be tested by the challenges of this new century  and at times you will fail  but know that you have it within your power to try  that generations who have come before you faced these same fears and uncertainties in their own time  and that if we're willing to shoulder each other's burdens  to take great risks  and to persevere through trial  america will continue its journey towards that distant horizon  and a better day  thank you  and congratulations on your graduation "], ["obama1", "i want to thank the university of iowa for having us here  and i want to give a special thanks to amy and lane for joining me today to tell their story  a few hours north of here  amy and lane run a small business that offers internet service to their community  they were the very first company to provide broadband access in their remote corner of northeastern iowa  and every day  hundreds of people count on the services they provide to do their jobs and live their lives  but today they are on the brink of bankruptcy   a bankruptcy that has nothing to do with any poor business decision they made or slump in the economy they weren't prepared for  lane was diagnosed with cancer when he was twenty one years old  he lost a lung  a leg bone and part of a hip  seventeen years later  he is cancer free  but the cost of health insurance for him  his wife and his three kids is now over   per month  their family's premiums keep rising hundreds of dollars every year  and as hard as they look  they simply cannot find another provider that will insure them  amy and lane are now paying forty percent of their annual income in health care premiums  they have no retirement plan and nothing saved  they can no longer afford to buy new clothes or fill up their cars with gas  they have racked up more credit card debt then they know what to do with  and amy wrote to us and said that the day she heard the loan officer say the word  bankruptcy  was one of the worst in her life   my heart was in pain  she said   this is not who we are  we have done everything right  we have done everything we were supposed to do  this is not who we are  amy is right  this is not who we are  we are not a country that rewards hard work and perseverance with bankruptcies and foreclosures  we are not a country that allows major challenges to go unsolved and unaddressed while our people suffer needlessly  in the richest nation on earth  it is simply not right that the skyrocketing profits of the drug and insurance industries are paid for by the skyrocketing premiums that come from the pockets of the american people  this is not who we are  and this is not who we have to be  in the past few months  i've heard stories like amy's at town halls we've held in new hampshire  and here in iowa  and all across the country  stories from people who are hanging on by a thread because of the stack of medical bills they can't pay  people who don't know where else to turn for help  but who do know that when it comes to health care  we have talked  tinkered  and let this crisis fester for decades  people who watch as every year  candidates offer up detailed health care plans with great fanfare and promise  only to see them crushed under the weight of washington politics and drug and insurance industry lobbying once the campaign is over  well this cannot be one of those years  we have reached a point in this country where the rising cost of health care has put too many families and businesses on a collision course with financial ruin and left too many without coverage at all  a course that democrats and republicans  small business owners and ceos have all come to agree is not sustainable or acceptable any longer  we often hear the statistic that there are   million uninsured americans  but the biggest reason why they don't have insurance is the same reason why those who do have it are struggling to pay their medical bills   it's just too expensive  health care premiums have risen nearly   in the past six years  that's four times faster than wages have gone up  like ami and lane's family  nearly half of all iowans have said that they've had to cut back on food and heating expenses because of high health care costs    million insured americans spent more than a quarter of their salary on health care last year  and over half of all personal bankruptcies are now caused by medical bills  businesses aren't faring much better  over half of all small businesses can no longer afford to insure their workers  and so many others have responded to rising costs by laying off workers or shutting their doors for good  some of the biggest corporations in america  giants of industry like gm and ford  are watching foreign competitors based in countries with universal health care run circles around them  with a gm car containing seven times as much health care cost as a japanese car  this cost crisis is trapping us in a vicious cycle  as premiums rise  more employers drop coverage  and more americans become uninsured  every time those uninsured walk into an emergency room and receive care that's more expensive because they have nowhere else to turn  there is a hidden tax for the rest of us as premiums go up by an extra   per family  and as premiums keep rising  more families and businesses drop their coverage and become uninsured  it would be one thing if all this money we spend on premiums and co payments and deductibles went directly towards making us healthier and improving the quality of our care  but it doesn't  one out of every four dollars we spend on health care is swallowed up by administrative costs   on needless paperwork and antiquated record keeping that belongs in the last century  this failure to update the way our doctors and hospitals store and share information also leads to costly errors  each year    americans die due to medical errors and we lose   billion because of prescription drug errors alone  we also spend far more on treating illnesses and conditions that could've been prevented or managed for far less  our health care system is turning into a disease care system  where too many plans and providers don't offer or encourage check ups and tests and screenings that could save thousands of lives and billions of dollars down the road  of course  the biggest obstacle in the way of reforming this skewed system of needless waste and spiraling costs are those who profit most from the status quo   the drug and insurance companies who pocket a growing chunk of the medical bills that people like amy and lane are going bankrupt trying to pay  since president bush took office  the single fastest growing component of health care spending has been administrative costs and profits for insurance companies  coming in a close second is the amount we spend on prescription drugs  in   five of the biggest drug and insurance companies were among the fifty most profitable businesses in the nation  one insurance company ceo received a   million salary that same year  and has been given stock options worth over   billion  as an added perk  he and his wife get free private health care for as long as they live  now  making this kind of money costs money  which is why the drug and insurance industries have also spent more than   billion on lobbying and campaign contributions over the last ten years to block the kind of reform we need  they've been pretty good at it too  preventing the sale of cheaper prescription drugs and defeating attempts to make it harder for insurance companies to deny coverage on the basis of a preexisting condition  look  it's perfectly understandable for a business to try and make a profit  and every american has the right to make their case to the people who represent us in washington  but i also believe that every american has the right to affordable health care  i believe that the millions of americans who can't take their children to a doctor when they get sick have that right  i believe that people like amy and lane who are on the brink of losing everything they own have that right  and i believe that no amount of industry profiteering and lobbying should stand in the way of that right any longer  that's not who we are  we now face an opportunity   and an obligation   to turn the page on the failed politics of yesterday's health care debates  it's time to bring together businesses  the medical community  and members of both parties around a comprehensive solution to this crisis  and it's time to let the drug and insurance industries know that while they'll get a seat at the table  they don't get to buy every chair  we can do this  the climate is far different than it was the last time we tried this in the early nineties  since then  rising costs have caused many more businesses to back reform  and in states from massachusetts to california  democratic and republican governors and legislatures have been way ahead of washington in passing increasingly bolder initiatives to cover the uninsured and cut costs  we've had some success in illinois as well  as a state senator  i brought republicans and democrats together to pass legislation insuring   more children and   more parents  i authored and passed a bill cracking down on hospital price gouging of uninsured patients  and helped expand coverage for routine mammograms for women on medicaid  we created hospital report cards  so that every consumer could see things like the ratio of nurses to patients  the number of annual medical errors  and the quality of care they could expect at each hospital  and i passed a law that put illinois on a path to universal coverage  it's a goal i believe we can achieve on a national level with the health care plan i'm outlining today  the very first promise i made on this campaign was that as president  i will sign a universal health care plan into law by the end of my first term in office  today i want to lay out the details of that plan   a plan that not only guarantees coverage for every american  but also brings down the cost of health care and reduces every family's premiums by as much as   this second part is important because  in the end  coverage without cost containment will only shift our burdens  not relieve them  so we will take steps to remove the waste and inefficiency from the system so we can bring down costs and improve the quality of our care while we're at it  my plan begins by covering every american  if you already have health insurance  the only thing that will change for you under this plan is the amount of money you will spend on premiums  that will be less  if you are one of the   million americans who don't have health insurance  you will have it after this plan becomes law  no one will be turned away because of a preexisting condition or illness  everyone will be able buy into a new health insurance plan that's similar to the one that every federal employee   from a postal worker in iowa to a congressman in washington   currently has for themselves  it will cover all essential medical services  including preventive  maternity  disease management  and mental health care  and it will also include high standards for quality and efficiency  if you cannot afford this insurance  you will receive a subsidy to pay for it  if you have children  they will be covered  if you change jobs  your insurance will go with you  if you need to see a doctor  you will not have to wait in long lines for one  if you want more choices  you will also have the option of purchasing a number of affordable private plans that have similar benefits and standards for quality and efficiency  to help pay for this  we will ask all but the smallest businesses who don't make a meaningful contribution today to the health coverage of their employees to do so by supporting this new plan  and we will allow the temporary bush tax cut for the wealthiest americans to expire  but we also have to demand greater efficiencies from our health care system  today  we pay almost twice as much for health care per person than other industrialized nations  and too much of it has nothing to do with patient care  that's why the second part of my health care plan includes five  long overdue steps we will take to bring down costs and bring our health care system into the  st century   steps that will save each american family up to   on their premiums  first  we will reduce costs for business and their workers by picking up the tab for some of the most expensive illnesses and conditions  right now  two out of every ten patients account for more than eighty percent of all health care costs  these are patients with serious illnesses like cancer or heart disease who require the most expensive surgeries and treatments  insurance companies end up spending a lion's share of their expenses on these patients  and not surprisingly  they pass those expenses on to the rest of us in the form of higher premiums  under my proposal  the federal government will pay for part of these catastrophic cases  which means that your premiums will go down  second  we will finally begin focusing our health care system on preventing costly  debilitating conditions in the first place  we all know the saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure  but today we're nowhere close to that ounce  we spend less than four cents of every health care dollar on prevention and public health even though eighty percent of the risk factors involved in the leading causes of death are behavior related and thus preventable  the problem is  there's currently no financial incentive for health care providers to offer services that will encourage patients to eat right or exercise or go for annual check ups and screenings that can help detect diseases early  the real profit today is made in treating diseases  not preventing them  that's wrong  which is why in our new national health care plan and other participating plans  we will require coverage of evidence based  preventive care services  and make sure they are paid for  but in the end  prevention only works if we take responsibility for our own health and make the right decisions in our own lives   if we eat the right foods  and stay active  and listen to our wives when they tell us to stop smoking  third  we will reduce the cost of our health care by improving the quality of our health care  it's estimated that poor quality care currently costs us up to   billion a year  one study found that in pennsylvania  medicare spent   billion a year just on treating infections that patients contracted while at the hospital   infections that could have easily been prevented by hospitals  this study led hospitals across the state to take action  and today some have completely eliminated infections that used to take hundreds of lives and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars every year  much like the hospital report cards we passed in illinois  my health care proposal will ask hospitals and providers to collect  track  and publicly report measures of health care quality  we'll provide the public with information about preventable medical errors  nurse to patient ratios  and hospital acquired infections  we'll also start measuring what's effective and what's not when it comes to different drugs and procedures  so that patients can finally start making informed choices about the care that's best for them  and instead of rewarding providers and physicians only by the sheer quantity of services and procedures they prescribe  we'll start rewarding them for the quality of the outcomes for their patients  fourth  we will reduce waste and inefficiency by moving from a  th century health care industry based on pen and paper to a  st century industry based on the latest information technology  almost every other industry in the world has saved billions on administrative costs by computerizing all of their records and information  every transaction you make at a bank now costs less than a dollar  even at the veterans administration  where it used to cost nine dollars to pull up your medical record  new technology means you can call up the same record on the internet for next to nothing  but because we haven't updated technology in the rest of the health care industry  a single transaction still costs up to twenty five dollars  this reform is long overdue  by moving to electronic medical records  we can give doctors and nurses easy access to all the necessary information about their patients  so if they type in a certain prescription  a patient's allergies will pop right up on the screen  this will reduce deadly medical errors  and it will also shorten the length of hospital stays  ensure that nurses can spend less time on paperwork and more time with patients  and save billions and billions of dollars in the process  finally  we will break the stranglehold that a few big drug and insurance companies have on the health care market  we all value the medical cures and innovations that the pharmaceutical industry has developed over the years  but it's become clear that some of these companies are dramatically overcharging americans for what they offer  they'll sell the same exact drugs here in america for double the price of what they charge in europe and canada  they'll push expensive products on doctors by showering them with gifts  spend more to market and advertise their drugs than to research and develop them  and when a generic drug maker comes along and wants to sell the same product for cheaper  the brand name manufacturers will actually payoff the generic ones so they can preserve their monopolies and keep charging the rest of us high prices  we don't have to stand for that anymore  under my plan  we will make generic drugs more available to consumers and we will tell the drug companies that their days of forcing affordable prescription drugs out of the market are over  and it's not just the drug industry that's manipulating the market  in the last ten years  there have been over four hundred health insurance mergers  right here in iowa  just three companies control more than three quarters of the health insurance market  these changes were supposed to increase efficiency in the industry  but what's really increased is the amount of money we're paying them  this is wrong  and when i'm president  we're going to make drug and insurance companies compete for their customers just like every other business in america  we'll investigate and prosecute the monopolization of the insurance industry  and where we do find places where insurance companies aren't competitive  we will make them pay a reasonable share of their profits on the patients they should be caring for in the first place  because that's what's right  we are a country that looks at the thousands of stories just like amy and lane's   stories we have heard and told for decades   and realizes that our american story calls on us to write them a hopeful  happier ending  after all  that's what we've done before  half a century ago  america found itself in the midst of another health care crisis  for millions of elderly americans  the single greatest cause of poverty and hardship was the crippling cost of their health care  a third of all elderly americans lived in poverty  and nearly half had no health insurance  as health care and hospital costs continued to rise  more and more private insurers simply refused to insure our elderly  believing they were too great of a risk to care for  the resistance to action was fierce  proponents of health care reform were opposed by well financed  well connected interest groups who spared no expense in telling the american people that these efforts were  dangerous  and  un american   revolutionary  and even  deadly  and yet the reformers marched on  they testified before congress and they took their case to the country and they introduced dozens of different proposals but always  always they stood firm on their goal to provide affordable health care for every american senior  and finally  after years of advocacy and negotiation and plenty of setbacks  president lyndon johnson signed the medicare bill into law on july  th of   the signing ceremony was held in missouri  in a town called independence  with the man who issued the call for universal health care during his own presidency   harry truman  and as he stood with truman by his side and signed what would become one of the most successful government programs in history   a program that had seemed impossible for so long   president johnson looked out at the crowd and said   history shapes men  but it is a necessary faith of leadership that men can help shape history  never forget that we have it within our power to shape history in this country  it is not in our character to sit idly by as victims of fate or circumstance  for we are a people of action and innovation  forever pushing the boundaries of what's possible  now is the time to push those boundaries once more  we have come so far in the debate on health care in this country  but now we must finally answer the call issued by truman  advanced by johnson  and pushed along by the simple power of stories like the one told by amy and lane  the time has come for affordable  universal health care in america  and i look forward to working with all of you to meet this challenge in the weeks and months to come  thank you "], ["obama1", "it is an honor to be here at hampton university  it is a privilege to stand with so many ministers from across this country and we thank god and all his blessings for this wonderful day  a few weeks ago  i attended a service at first a m e  church in los angeles to commemorate the  th anniversary of the la riots  after a jury acquitted   police officers of beating rodney king a beating that was filmed and flashed around the world  los angeles erupted  i remember the sense of despair and powerlessness in watching one of america's greatest cities engulfed in flames  but in the middle of that desperate time  there was a miracle  a baby born with a bullet in its arm  we need to hear about these miracles in these desperate times because they are the blessings that can unite us when some in the world try to drive a wedge between our common humanity and deep   br  abiding faith  and this story  too  starts with a baby  we learned about this child from a doctor named andy moosa  he was working the afternoon shift on april   at st  francis medical center in lynwood as the second day of violence was exploding in the streets  he told us about a pregnant woman who had been wearing a white dress  she was in compton and on her way to the supermarket  where the bullet came from nobody knew  her sister in law noticed a red spot in the middle of her white dress and said that i think you've been shot  the bullet had gone in  but it had not exited  the doctor described the ultrasound and how he realized that the bullet was in the baby  the doctor said   we could tell it was lodged in one of the upper limbs  we needed to get this baby out so we were in the delivery room  and here's the thing  the baby looked great  except for the swelling in the right elbow in the fleshy part  it hadn't even fractured a bone  the bullet had lodged in the soft tissue in the muscle  by god's grace  the baby was fine  it was breathing and crying and kicking  they removed the bullet  stitched up the baby's arm  and everything was fine  the doctor went on to say that there's always going to be a scar to remind that child how quickly she came into the world in very unusual circumstances  i've been thinking and praying about that story  i've been thinking that there's always going to be a scar there  that doesn't go away  you take the bullet out  you stitch up the wound and   years later  there's still going to be a scar  many of the folks in this room know just where they were when the riot in los angeles started and tragedy struck the corner of florence and normandy  and most of the ministers here know that those riots didn't erupt over night  there had been a  quiet riot  building up in los angeles and across this country for years  if you had gone to any street corner in chicago or baton rouge or hampton   you would have found the same young men and women without hope  without miracles  and without a sense of destiny other than life on the edge   the edge of the law  the edge of the economy  the edge of family structures and communities  those  quiet riots  that take place every day are born from the same place as the fires and the destruction and the police decked out in riot gear and the deaths  they happen when a sense of disconnect settles in and hope dissipates  despair takes hold and young people all across this country look at the way the world is and believe that things are never going to get any better  you tell yourself  my school will always be second rate  you tell yourself  there will never be a good job waiting for me to excel at  you tell yourself  i will never be able to afford a place that i can be proud of and call my home  that despair quietly simmers and makes it impossible to build strong communities and neighborhoods  and then one afternoon a jury says   not guilty    or a hurricane hits new orleans   and that despair is revealed for the world to see  much of what we saw on our television screens   years ago was los angeles expressing a lingering  ongoing  pervasive legacy a tragic legacy out of the tragic history this country has never fully come to terms with  this is not to excuse the violence of bashing in a man's head or destroying someone's store and their life's work  that kind of violence is inexcusable and self defeating  it does  however  describe the reality of many communities around this country  and it made me think about our cities and communities all around this country  how not only do we still have scars from that riot and the  quiet riots  that happen every day but how in too many places we haven't even taken the bullet out  look at what happened in new orleans and along the gulf coast when katrina hit  people ask me whether i thought race was the reason the response was so slow  i said   no  this administration was colorblind in its incompetence  but everyone here knows the disaster and the poverty happened long before that hurricane hit  all the hurricane did was make bare what we ignore each and every day which is that there are whole sets of communities that are impoverished  that don't have meaningful opportunity  that don't have hope and they are forgotten  this disaster was a powerful metaphor for what's gone on for generations  of course  the federal response after katrina was similar to the response after the riots in los angeles  people in washington wake up and are surprised that there's poverty in our midst  and that others were frustrated and angry  then there are panels and there are hearings  there are commissions  there are reports  aid dollars are approved but they can't seem to get to the people  and then nothing really changes except the news coverage quiets down  this isn't to diminish the extraordinary generosity of the american people at the time  our churches and denominations were particularly generous during this time  sending millions of dollars  thousands of volunteers and countless prayers down to the gulf coast  but despite this extraordinary generosity  here we are   months later   or   years later in the case of la   and the homes haven't been built  the businesses haven't returned  and those same communities are still drowning and smoldering under the same hopelessness as before the tragedy hit  and so god is asking us today to remember that miracle of that baby  and he is asking us to take that bullet out once more  if we have more black men in prison than are in our colleges and universities  then it's time to take the bullet out  if we have millions of people going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma  it's time to take the bullet out  if too many of our kids don't have health insurance  it's time to take the bullet out  if we keep sending our kids to dilapidated school buildings  if we keep fighting this war in iraq  a war that never should have been authorized and waged  a war that's costing us   million dollars a day and a war that is taking too many innocent lives   if we have all these challenges and nothing's changing  then every minister in america needs to come together   form our own surgery teams  and take the bullets out  so what's stopping us  what's stopping us from taking these bullets out and rebuilding our families  our communities  our nation and our faith in one another  what's stopping us from seeing the light and the way and the faith that unites us  well  i've been on a journey trying to get at the truth of that question  that journey started a long time ago in hawaii  but it got interesting when i moved to chicago  i moved there when i was just a year out of college  and a group of churches offered me a job as a community organizer so i could help rebuild neighborhoods that had been devastated by the closing of steel plants  they didn't pay me much  but they gave me enough to live on plus something extra to buy an old  beat up car  and so i took the job and drove out to chicago  where i didn't know a soul  and during the time i was there  we worked to set up job training programs for the unemployed and after school programs for kids  it was also there   at trinity united church of christ on the south side of chicago   that i met rev  jeremiah a  wright jr  who took me on another journey and introduced me to a man named jesus christ  it was the best education i ever had  at and working in the south side  i learned that when church folks come together  they can achieve extraordinary things  after three years  i went back across this country to law school  i left there with a degree and a lifetime of debt  but i turned down the corporate job offers so i could come back to chicago and organize a voter registration drive  i also started a civil rights practice  and began to teach constitutional law  after a few years  people started coming up to me and telling me i should run for state senate  so i did what every man does when he's faced with a big decision   i prayed on it  and i asked my wife  and after consulting those two higher powers  i decided to get in the race  everywhere i'd go  i'd get two questions  first  they'd ask   where'd you get that funny name  barack obama  because people just couldn't pronounce it  they'd call me   alabama  or they'd call me  yo mama  and i'd tell them that my father was from kenya  and that's where i got my name  and my mother was from kansas  and that's where i got my accent from  and the second thing people would ask me gets back to the question about why we can't seem to take the bullet out in this country and do the works and the deeds and unite this country  they'd say   you seem like a nice young man  you've done all this great work  you've been a community organizer  and you teach law school  you're a civil rights attorney  you're a family man   why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics  and i understand the question  and the cynicism  we all understand it  we understand it because we get the sense today that politics has become a business and not a mission  the leaders in washington have forgotten president kennedy's call to remember that  here on earth god's work must truly be our own  in the last several years  we have seen washington become a place where driving the wedge to further divide us and keeping score of who's up and who's down is more important than who's working on behalf of the sick and the hungry and the lonely  we have been told that our mounting debts don't matter  that the economy is doing great  and that people's anxieties about rising health care costs and disappearing pensions aren't a big deal  we've been told that climate change is a hoax  that our broken schools cannot be fixed  and that we are destined to send millions of dollars a day to mideast dictators for their oil  and when it comes to faith  we've been told that all that matters is what divides us   evangelicals from mainline protestants  the black church from the white church  catholics from protestants from muslims from jews  and when we try to have an honest debate about the crises we face  whether it's from the pulpit or the campaign trail  the pundits don't want us to find common ground  they want us to find someone to blame  they want to divide us into red states and blue states  and tell us to always point the finger at somebody else   the other party  or gay people  or people of faith  or immigrants  this journey teaches us that they are going to keep driving that wedge  they are going to keep the distraction going  they are going to keep our faiths separate until we shout from the mountain top   our father who art in heaven  we are going to take the bullets out  we believe in your will and your way  right here in this room  we believe that god is big enough to overcome the smallness of our politics  that he is big enough to overcome our doubts and our cynicism and our worries  that he is big enough to love children of every color and creed and political label  ministers  it's time to unite behind our faith and help all of god's children around the world and here at home realize that we are all surgeons  our faith  the word and his will are the instruments we need to take the bullets out  let's start with fighting poverty  there are   million americans who are poor  most work  most are single mothers and children  and most are forgotten by leaders in washington  it's time to take the bullet out and lift the poor out of despair and into the middle class of america  that's why throughout my years in the illinois state senate and every day of this campaign  i've been fighting to expand the eitc  create a living wage  put a qualified teacher and more math and science teachers in our struggling schools  increase pell grants so more people can go to college  build more homes people can afford  go after predatory lenders  and make sure we rebuild new orleans and the gulf  we've been working hard to take those bullets  but we need to do more to fight poverty in this country  i need your support to do that  and i want to tell you quickly about a few new ideas i have today  we can diminish poverty if we approach it in two ways  by taking mutual responsibility for each other as a society  and also by asking for some more individual responsibility to strengthen our families br  if we want to stop the cycle of poverty  then we need to start with our families  we need to start supporting parents with young children  there is a pioneering nurse family partnership program right now that offers home visits by trained registered nurses to low income mothers and mothers to be  they learn how to care for themselves before the baby is born and what to do after  it's common sense to reach out to a young mother  teach her about changing the baby  help her understand what all that crying means  and when to get vaccines and check ups  this program saves money  it raises healthy babies and creates better parents  it reduced childhood injuries and unintended pregnancies  increased father involvement and women's employment  reduced use of welfare and food stamps  and increased children's school readiness  and it produced more than   in net savings for every high risk family enrolled in the program  this works and i will expand the nurse family partnership to provide at home nurse visits for up to   first time mothers each year  we can do this  our god is big enough for that  we need to give our young people some real choices out there so they move away from gangs and violence and connect them with growing job sectors  that is why i am also going to create a  e youth service corps  the  e's  stand for energy efficiency  environmental education and employment  this program would directly engage disconnected and disadvantaged young people in energy efficiency and environmental service opportunities to strengthen their communities while also providing them with practical skills and experience in important and growing career field  we can do this  when it comes to bringing hope and real job opportunities to our young people  we can take the bullet out  our god is big enough for that  we know what works  we know that supporting ex offenders and their families keeps our men out of prison  that makes a difference in our families and can stop the cycle of poverty  that is why i will expand federal programs that help ex offenders and sign the second chance act into law  as president  i will do more to strengthen support to state correctional systems so that ex offenders can meet their parole requirements without worrying about losing their jobs  i will create a prison to work incentive program  modeled on the successful welfare to work program  it would create strong ties with employers  job training agencies and ex offenders to improve job retention rates  and i will reach out to all the reverends and engage faith based organizations to provide support for ex offenders and their families  both during incarceration and after  we can do that for our families  our god is a forgiving god  he's certainly big enough for that  but we need to do a better job making sure that there are jobs in our communities  we need to provide economic opportunity in every corner of our country if we want to take the bullet out  we know that we have to invest in transitional jobs too  when there are people who are homeless  veterans struggling with post traumatic stress disorder from this war in iraq  and thousands of children aging out of foster care  we can't expect them to have all the skills they need for work  they may need help with basic skills how to show up to work on time  wear the right clothes  and act appropriately in an office  we have to help them get there  that's why i have called for   million to begin innovative new job training and workforce development programs  but what good are these efforts if men and women can't afford the bus fare or the subway fare or the car insurance to get to the training center or new job  that is why  as president  i will invest in transportation  we know that three quarters of welfare recipients live in areas that are poorly served by public transportation and low income workers spend up to   of their incomes on transportation  that is why i will fight to ensure that the federal jobs access and reverse commute program provides grants to improve low income access to transportation  and that additional federal public transportation dollars flow to the highest need communities  no one should be denied work in this country because they can't find public transportation in their neighborhood  but we should do just as much if not more to invest in minority owned businesses in our neighborhoods so people don't need to travel miles away in the first place  right now  less than one percent of the   billion in venture capital dollars that we invest nationwide each year has been directed to the country's   million minority business owners  and in recent years  there has been a significant decline in the share of the small business investment company financings that have gone to minority owned and women owned businesses  we are going to change that and strengthen the small business administration to provide more capital minority owned businesses  we can do that br  and here's one final idea today that will help break the cycle of poverty   affordable health care for every american  our god is big enough for that now  the other day i met a couple who owns a small business in northern iowa that hundreds of people in their community count on every day to get their internet access  but today they are on the verge of bankruptcy   and it's all because of their health care costs  seventeen years ago the husband had cancer  he's recovered now  but every year since then  his family's premiums have gone up  and they can't find anyone else who will insure them  they now pay forty percent of their income in health care premiums  they haven't been able to save a dime for their kids' college education  and they're having trouble paying for things like clothes and gas  when the loan officer first uttered the word  bankruptcy  it was one of the worst days of their life  they said   we have done everything right  we have done everything we were supposed to do  this is not who we are  this is not who we are  i have a health care plan that will cover every american and cut the cost of every family's premiums by up to   a year  if you don't have health care  this plan will offer you coverage that's similar to the kind federal employees and members of congress give themselves  if you do have health care  it will bring down your premiums by investing in information technology  and preventive care  and by stopping the drug companies from price gouging when patients need their medicine  it will help business and families shoulder the burden of catastrophic care so that an illness doesn't lead to a bankruptcy  and i promise you this   this health care plan will be signed into law by the end of my first term in office as president  before we can start that work  we need to end this war in iraq  we are spending   million a day in iraq  those dollars could go a long way to ending poverty in this country  this war should never have been authorized and waged  i opposed it from the very start  back in   when it wasn't popular to be against this war  i opposed it because i believed strongly that it could lead to the disaster we find ourselves in today  with our brave young service men and women mired in the middle of a civil war  that's why i introduced a plan in january that would have brought them home by march  st  while forcing the iraqi government to meet its obligations  we need   republican votes in the senate to force this president to change course  this is the only chance we have to truly end the war  it's not symbolic  this is real  sixteen votes and we can turn the page on this war  sixteen votes and we can start bringing our men and women home  our god is big enough for that  our god is calling on us to do that  we all know that our faith will be tested and challenged  it happens to each and every one of us  as some of you know  during the   u s  senate general election i ran against a gentleman named alan keyes  mr  keyes is well versed in the pat robertson style of rhetoric that often labels progressives as both immoral and godless  indeed  mr  keyes announced toward the end of the campaign that   jesus christ would not vote for barack obama  christ would not vote for barack obama because barack obama has behaved in a way that it is inconceivable for christ to have behaved  jesus christ would not vote for barack obama br  it nagged at me in that campaign because i did not respond with the full force of what i found that sunday morning at united church of christ  that our faith can never be used as a driving force to divide us  that with a big god  with a loving and forceful god we need to unite in his name to finish his work on earth  it reminds me of a simple truth  a truth i learned all those years ago as an organizer in chicago a truth you speak of in your churches every sunday  in the face of impossible odds  people who love their country can change it  with a uniting faith  with a god powerful enough to empower us we can take the bullets out  we know how the doctors do it  we watch some of these tv shows like er and gray's anatomy  the doctors are in the operating room  you've got a head surgeon  and one's got the scalpel  but others are watching the monitors and administering the iv  the nurses are on the job  the orderlies are on the job  there was a team that got the bullet out of that baby girl   years ago  she's got a scar on her arm  always will  but she survived  america is going to survive  we won't forget where we came from  we won't forget what happened   months ago    years ago  thousands of years ago  we know who the head surgeon is  and we're on the case  we're going to pull out bullet after bullet  we're going to stitch up arm after arm  we're going to wear those scars for justice  we're going to usher in a new america the way that newborn child was ushered in  we're never going to forget there is always hope   there is always light in the midst of desperate days   that a baby can be born even with a bullet in her arm  and we can come together as one people and transform this nation  our god is big enough for that   em  as prepared for delivery em "], ["obama1", "it has now been a little over four months since we began this campaign  and everywhere we've been   whether it's oakland or cleveland  atlanta or austin   we've been getting these inspiring  humbling crowds of thousands  for a lot of people  it's the first political event of their lifetime  i'd like to take all the credit myself  but i know that's not the only reason they're coming  there is a hunger in this country right now   a longing for something new that we haven't seen in years  and whenever i stop and think about it  i'm reminded of what got me into public service in the first place  the year after college  i decided to move to chicago  it was a time where factory closings were sweeping the midwest  and thousands were being laid off  and they were boarding up homes and businesses  on the south side of chicago  where neighborhoods were struggling to rebuild after the closing of nearby steel plants  a group of churches came together and decided that they could make a difference  and they hired me to help  the salary was   a year plus enough money to buy an old  beat up car  so i took the job and became a community organizer  we went to work setting up job training programs for the unemployed and after school programs for kids  and block by block  we turned those neighborhoods around  it was the best education i ever had  because i learned in those neighborhoods that when ordinary people come together  they can achieve extraordinary things  and so later  when i finished law school  i turned down the corporate job offers and i came back to chicago to continue the work i started  i organized a voter registration drive that signed up   new voters to help elect bill clinton in   i joined a civil rights law practice  and i started teaching constitutional law   because unlike some occupants of the white house  i actually believe in the constitution  and after a few years  people started coming up to me and telling me i should run for state senate  so i jumped in the race  and i shook every hand i could and passed out flyers to whoever would take them  but the one question i'd get from people more than any other was   you seem like a nice young man  you've done all this great work  you've been a community organizer  and you teach law school  you're a civil rights attorney  you're a family man   why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics  and i understand the question  and the cynicism  we all understand it  we understand it because we've all seen that politics in this town is no longer a mission   it's a business  our politics has never been pure  but there's a sense that in the last several years  the race for money  and influence  and power has left the hopes and concerns of most americans in the dust  you're worried about how you'll pay for college  or health care  or save for retirement  but when you turn on the tv or open the newspaper  all you see from washington is another scandal  or a petty argument  or the persistent stubbornness of a president who refuses to end this war in iraq  as the rest of us have turned away from this kind of politics in cynicism and frustration  we know what's filled the void  the lobbyists and influence peddlers with the cash and the connections   the ones who've turned government into a game only they can afford to play  it's the pharmaceutical companies that get to write our drug bills while the price of prescriptions skyrockets for the rest of us  it's the oil lobbyists that get to meet with the same white house that silences the scientists who warn us about the destruction of our planet  you know who i'm talking about here  they write the checks and you get stuck with the bills  they get the access while you get to write a letter  they think they own this government  but we're here to tell them it's not for sale  people tell me i haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of washington  but i promise you this   i've been here long enough to know that the ways of washington must change  the cynicism we feel about what politics can achieve today is no accident  it has to do with a failure of leadership  it has to do with the philosophy they've peddled in this town for the last six years   a philosophy of trickle down and on your own that says government has no role in solving the challenges we face and so it shouldn't even try  it's a theory that's easy to talk about when you're playing politics in washington  but harder to defend when you actually see what it does to average americans  i met a family in iowa city with a small business of fifteen years who is now facing bankruptcy because of their medical bills  try telling them they're on their own  i spoke with workers in newton who were watching their maytag plant close down and their shops get shipped overseas  try telling them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps  try saying  tough luck  to the families who still don't have homes in new orleans  or the   million americans without health care  or the   million children born into poverty in the richest nation on earth  this is not who we are  this is not how america has persevered through war and depression  through struggles for civil rights and women's rights and worker's rights  we have come this far as a nation because we believe in a different kind of politics   because we believe in a different vision for america  we believe that we rise or fall as one people  we believe that we each have a stake in one another   that i am my brother's keeper  that i am my sister's keeper  we believe that what happens to that family in iowa  or to those maytag workers   that matters to us  even if it's not our family  or our job  and what's more   in the face of our cynicism  and our doubts  and the power and influence we see in washington  we believe that this kind of america is possible  the time for the can't do  won't do  won't even try style of politics is over  it's time to turn the page  some of our more cynical friends in the media tease me from time to time for always talking about hope  but the reason i do is because i've seen its power  no one thought those south side neighborhoods had a chance when i got there  but we banded together  and we kept working  and we taught people to stand up to their government when it wasn't standing up for them  when i got to the illinois state senate  people said it was too hard to take on the issue of money in politics   that our state had too long a history  and too many entrenched interests  but i knew we had the people of illinois on our side  and i even found a few folks on the other side of the aisle who were willing to listen  and we passed the first major ethics reform in twenty five years  people told me i couldn't reform a death penalty system that had sent   innocent people to death row  but we did that  they doubted whether we could put government back on the side of average people   but we put tax cuts in the pockets of the working families who needed them instead of the folks who didn't  and i passed health care reform that insured another   children and parents  so i know that change is possible  i know that turning the page is possible  this isn't just the rhetoric of a campaign  it's been the cause of my life   a cause i will work for and fight for every day as your president  it's not enough just to change parties in this election  if we hope to truly transform this country  we have to change our politics too  it's time to turn the page  it's time to turn the page on health care   to bring together unions and businesses  democrats and republicans  and to let the insurance and drug companies know that while they get a seat at the table  they don't get to buy every chair  i have a universal health care plan that will cover every american and cut the cost of a typical family's premiums by up to   a year  it's a plan that lets the uninsured buy insurance that's similar to the kind members of congress give themselves  if you can't afford that  you'll get a subsidy to pay for it  and it goes further than any other proposed plan in cutting the cost of health care by investing in technology and preventative care  breaking the stranglehold the drug and insurance industries have on the health care market  and helping business and families shoulder the cost of the most expensive conditions so that an illness doesn't lead to a bankruptcy  and i promise you this   i will sign a universal health care plan that covers every american by the end of my first term in office as your president  count on it  it's time to turn the page on education   to move past the slow decay of indifference that says some schools can't be fixed and some kids just can't learn  as president  i will launch a campaign to recruit and support hundreds of thousands of new teachers across the country  because the most important part of any education is the person standing in the front of the classroom  it's time to treat teaching like the profession it is  it's time to pay our teachers what they deserve  and when it comes to developing the high standards we need  it's time to stop working against our teachers and start working with them  we can do this  it's time to turn the page on energy   to break the political stalemate that's kept our fuel efficiency standards in the same place for twenty years  to tell the oil and auto industries that they must act  not only because their future's at stake  but because the future of our country and our planet is at stake as well  as president  i will place a cap on carbon emissions  and require companies who can't meet the cap to buy credits from those who can  this will generate millions of dollars to invest in renewable sources of energy and create new jobs and even a new industry in the process  i'll put in place a low carbon fuel standard that will take   million cars' worth of pollution off the road  and i'd raise the fuel efficiency standards for our cars and trucks because we know we have the technology to do it and it's time we did  we can do this  it's time to turn the page for all those americans who want nothing more than to have a job that can pay the bills and raise a family  let's finally make the minimum wage a living wage and tie it to the cost of living so we don't have to wait another ten years to see it rise  let's put the jobless back to work in transitional jobs that can give them a paycheck and a sense of pride  let's help our workers advance with job training and life long education  and let's finally allow our unions to do what they do best and lift up the middle class in this country once more  and when you head to capitol hill in a little bit to rally for the employee free choice act  say it loud enough so that the folks on the other end of pennsylvania avenue can hear you   in this country  we believe that if the majority of workers in a company want a union  they should get a union  we can do this  we can do all of this  but before we do  we have to begin by turning the page and ending this war  i am proud that i stood up in   and urged our leaders not to take us down this dangerous path  i've said it before and i'll say it again   this is a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged  so many of us knew this back then  even when it wasn't popular to say so  we knew back then this war was a mistake  we knew back then that it was dangerous diversion from the struggle against the terrorists who attacked us on september  th  we knew back then that we could find ourselves in an occupation of undetermined length  at undetermined cost  with undetermined consequences  but the war went forward  and now  we've seen those consequences and we mourn for the dead and wounded  i was in new hampshire the other month when a woman told me that her nephew was leaving for iraq  and as she started telling me how much she'd miss him and how worried she was about him  she began to cry  and she said to me   i can't breathe  i want to know  when am i going to be able to breathe again  it is time to let this woman know she can breathe again  it's time to start bringing our troops home   not a year from now or a month from now   but now  i introduced a plan in january that would've already started bringing our troops home by now  with the goal of bringing all combat brigades home by march  st    now  we know the president vetoed a bipartisan plan just like this one a few weeks ago  and i'm proud i voted against giving a blank check to the man who said he sees us keeping our troops in iraq for as long as we have in korea  but we can't give george bush the last word here  we are sixteen votes away in the senate from ending this war  and so we need to keep turning up the pressure on all those republican congressmen and senators who refuse to acknowledge the reality that the american people know so well  we will call them  and knock on their doors  and we will bring our troops home  it's time to turn the page  it's time to show the world that america is still the last  best hope of earth  this president may occupy the white house  but for the last six years the position of leader of the free world has remained open  it's time to fill that role once more  whether it's terrorism or climate change  global aids or the spread of weapons of mass destruction  america cannot meet the threats of this new century alone  but the world cannot meet them without america  it's time for us to lead  it's time for us to close guantanamo and restore the right of habeus corpus  it's time to show the world that we are not a country that ships prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries  that we are not a country that runs prisons which lock people away without ever telling them why they are there or what they are charged with  we are not a country which preaches compassion to others while we allow bodies to float down the streets of a major american city  that is not who we are  we are america  we are the nation that liberated a continent from a madman  that lifted ourselves from the depths of depression  that won civil rights  and women's rights  and voting rights for all our people  we are the beacon that has led generations of weary travelers to find opportunity  and liberty  and hopeon our doorstep  that's who we are  i was down in selma  alabama awhile back  and we were celebrating the  nd anniversary of the march across the edmund pettus bridge  it was a march of ordinary americans   maids and cooks  preachers and pullman porters who faced down fire hoses and dogs  tear gas and billy clubs when they tried to get to the other side  but every time they were stopped  every time they were knocked down  they got back up  they came back  and they kept on marching  and finally they crossed over  it was called bloody sunday  and it was the culmination of the civil rights movement  when i came back from that celebration  people would say  oh  what a wonderful celebration of african american history that must have been  and i would say  no  that wasn't african american history  that was a celebration ofamerican history   it's our story  and it reminds us of a simple truth   a truth i learned all those years ago as an organizer in chicago   a truth you carry by being here today   that in the face of impossible odds  people who love their country can change it  i am confident about my ability to lead this country  but i also know that i can't do it without you  this campaign that we're running has to be about your hopes  and your dreams  and what you will do  because there are few obstacles that can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change  that's how change has always happened   not from the top down  but from the bottom up  and that's exactly how you and i will change this country  if you want a new kind of politics  it's time to turn the page  if you want an end to the old divisions  and the stale debates  and the score keeping and the name calling  it's time to turn the page  if you want health care for every american and a world class education for all our children  if you want energy independence and an end to this war in iraq  if you believe america is still that last  best hope of earth  then it's time to turn the page  it's time to turn the page for hope  it's time to turn the page for justice  it is time to turn the page and write the next chapter in the great american story  let's begin the work  let's do this together  let's turn that page  thank you   em  as prepared for delivery em "], ["obama1", "over one hundred years ago  around the turn of the last century  the industrial revolution was beginning to take hold of america  creating unimaginable wealth in sprawling metropolises all across the country  as factories multiplied and profits grew  the winnings of the new economy became more and more concentrated in the hands of a few robber barons  railroad tycoons and oil magnates  it was known as the gilded age  and it was made possible by a government that played along  from the politicians in washington to the big city machines  a vast system of payoffs and patronage  scandal and corruption kept power in the hands of the few while the workers who streamed into the new factories found it harder and harder to earn a decent wage or work in a safe environment or get a day off once in awhile  eventually  leaders committed to reform began to speak out all across america  demanding a new kind of politics that would give government back to the people  one was the young governor of the state of new york  in just his first year  he had already begun to antagonize the state's political machine by attacking its system of favors and corporate giveaways  he also signed a workers' compensation bill  and fired a high level official for taking money from the very industry he was supposed to be regulating  none of this reform sat too well with new york's powerful party boss  who finally plotted to get rid of the governor by making sure he was nominated for the vice presidency that year  what no one could have expected is that soon after the election  when president william mckinley was assassinated  the greatest fears of all the entrenched interests came true when that former governor became president of the united states  his name  of course  was teddy roosevelt  and during his presidency  he went on to bust trusts  break up monopolies  and do his best to give the american people a shot at the dream once more  over a century later  america needs this kind of leadership more than ever  we need a president who sees government not as a tool to enrich well connected friends and high priced lobbyists  but as the defender of fairness and opportunity for every american  that's what this country has always been about  and that's the kind of president i intend to be  we cannot settle for a second gilded age in america  and yet we find ourselves once more in the midst of a new economy where more wealth is in danger of falling into fewer hands  where the average ceo now earns more in one day than an average worker earns in an entire year  where americans are struggling like never before to pay their medical bills  or their kids' tuition  or high gas prices  all while the profits of the drug and insurance and oil industries have never been higher  and once again  we are faced with a politics that makes all of this possible  in the last six years  our leaders have thrown open the doors of congress and the white house to an army of washington lobbyists who have turned our government into a game only they can afford to play   a game played on a field that's no longer level  but rigged to always favor their own narrow agendas  from jack abramoff to tom delay  from briberies to indictments  the scandals that have plagued washington over the last few years have been too numerous to recall  but their most troubling aspect goes far beyond the headlines that focus on the culprits and their crimes  it's an entire culture in washington   some of it legal  some of it not   that allows this to happen  because what's most outrageous is not the morally offensive conduct on behalf of these lobbyists and legislators  but the morally offensive laws and decisions that get made as a result  the drug and insurance industries spent   billion in lobbying over the last decade  they got what they paid for when their friends in congress broke the rules and twisted arms to push through a prescription drug bill that actually made it illegal for our own government to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies for cheaper drug prices  once it passed  those companies rewarded fifteen government officials and congressmen who worked on the bill with cushy lobbying jobs that pay millions  and yet  right now  there are parents and grandparents in this country who will walk into a drugstore and wonder how their social security check isgoing to cover a prescription that's more expensive than it was a month ago  who will be forced to choose between their medicine and their groceries because they can no longer afford both  this isn't the government they deserve  the oil companies were allowed to craft energy policy with dick cheney in secret while every other voice was silenced   including the nasa scientists who tried to warn us about the dangers of climate change  the industry got everything it wanted  and it even got one of its top lobbyists a job at the white house as an environmental watchdog   a job he used to fix reports that showed a link between carbon emissions and global warming  today  our planet is six years closer to a tipping point on climate change  our country grows more dependent by the day on oil supplied by some of the world's most dangerous and defiant regimes  and in a year where exxon reported the biggest annual profit of any u s  corporation in history  our families are heading into a summer where they could pay up to four dollars a gallon for gasoline in some places  this isn't the government we deserve  at least eight top officials in our own education department have taken or had jobs in the student loan industry  including one who was fired for still owning   worth of stock in that industry  these are the same private lenders and banks who have been caught actually bribing colleges to steer business their way   the same ones who charge taxpayers   billion a year to provide student loans at inflated rates  instead of offering the loans directly and using the savings to help more kids  and we wonder why   students didn't go to college in one recent year for the simple reason that they couldn't afford it  billions of no bid  no strings attached contracts have been handed out in new orleans and iraq and at walter reed medical center on the sole basis of who you know and the favors you've done  and yet we're somehow surprised when the families in the  th ward are still living in trailers  or our soldiers don't have the body armor they need  or our veterans are forced to come home to squalor and neglect  this isn't the government they deserve  this isn't the america we believe in  and this is the kind of politics that will end when i am president  americans of every background and belief are hungry for a new kind of politics   a people's politics that reconnects them with their government  one that offers not just a vote at the ballot box  but a voice in washington and an assurance that the leaders we send there will hear it  the people i've met across this country don't just want reform for reform's sake  they want reform that will help pay their doctor's bills  or ensure that their tax dollars are spent wisely  or put us on the path to energy independence  they want real reform and they're tired of the lobbyists standing in the way  look  we can't begrudge businesses for trying to make a profit  that's how the free market works  and every american   rich or poor   has the right to lobby their government  that's perfectly fine  but it's time we had a president who tells the drug companies and the oil companies and the insurance industry that while they get a seat at the table in washington  they don't get to buy every chair  not anymore  i know that in every campaign  politicians make promises about cleaning up washington  and most times  you end up disappointed when it doesn't happen  so it's easy to become cynical   to believe that change isn't possible  that the odds are too great  that this year is bound to be no different from the last  but i also know what i've seen and what i've done  i know that for me  reform isn't just the rhetoric of a campaign  it's been a cause of my career  when i arrived in springfield a decade ago as a state senator  people said it was too hard to take on the issue of money in politics  illinois actually had a law that allowed politicians to pocket the money in their campaign accounts for personal use  that allowed any lobbyist or special interest to shower lawmakers with unlimited gifts  it was obvious that as long as this went on  the people's business would never come first  i knew it was going to be tough  and that i wasn't going to make myself the most popular guy in town   or even in my own party  but we had the people of illinois on our side  and that there were folks on both sides of the aisle who were willing to listen  and so we were finally able to pass the first major ethics reform in twenty five years  when i arrived in washington eight years later  the need for change was equally clear  big money and lobbyists were clearly drowning out the aspirations of the american people  so when my party made me the point person on ethics  i was determined to pass the strongest reform possible  the first time around  congress came up with a watered down version  and i was proud to vote against it  so we came back the second time  and in our bill  we banned gifts and meals and put an end to subsidized travel on corporate jets  we made sure that the american people could see all the pet projects that lawmakers were trying to pass before they were voted on  and we did something more  over the objections of powerful voices in both parties  we shined a bright light on how lobbyists help fill the campaign coffers of members of congress  and we made sure those lobbyists will have to disclose who they're raising campaign money from  and who in congress they're funneling it to  as a candidate for president  i've tried to lead by example  turning down all contributions from federal lobbyists and the political action committees that the special interests use to pass out campaign money  now  it's true that all of this represents a step forward when it comes to reconnecting people with their government  but it's also true that a step forward isn't good enough  too often in washington  special interests still exercise an effective veto on our progress  on issues from health care reform and drug costs to energy independence and global warming  we saw how this happens during the debate over the energy bill this week  in the face of furious lobbying  congress brushed aside incentives for the production of more renewable fuels in favor of more tax breaks for the oil and gas companies  and while we made some progress on fuel economy standards  we didn't get the bold  long lasting solution that america needs to break its dependency on foreign oil  so there's more cleaning up to do in washington and congress needs to start doing it so we can finally take action on the big challenges that demand solutions  but we need to clean up both ends of pennsylvania avenue  i believe that the responsibility for a people's politics begins with the person who sits in the oval office  that is why on my very first day as president  i will launch the most sweeping ethics reform in history to make the white house the people's house and send the washington lobbyists back to k street  first  we will close the revolving door that has allowed people to use their administration job as a stepping stone to further their lobbying careers  this administration tried to fill the top job at the consumer product safety commission with a lobbyist from the same manufacturing industry it's supposed to regulate  if michael baroody had taken that job  and he faced a complaint over an unsafe product  whose interest would he have served   the mother worried about the lead in her child's toy  or the former boss who gave him a special   severance package on his way out the door  when you're on dick cheney's energy task force and you know that a multimillion dollar job as an oil lobbyist could be waiting for you  whose interests are you going to serve   the oil companies that are asking for more tax breaks or the scientists and energy experts who say we need to invest in renewable fuels  when i am president  i will make it absolutely clear that working in an obama administration is not about serving your former employer  your future employer  or your bank account   it's about serving your country  and that's what comes first  when you walk into my administration  you will not be able to work on regulations or contracts directly related to your former employer for two years  and when you leave  you will not be able to lobby the administration throughout the remainder of my term in office  a lot of people have told me this is pretty tough  but i refuse to accept the washington logic that you cannot find thousands of talented  patriotic americans willing to devote a few years to their country without the promise of a lucrative lobbying job after they're done  i know we can find them  and in my administration  we will  second  i will end the abuse of no bid contracts in my administration  in the last six years  the unprecedented use of these contracts has wasted billions of taxpayer dollars and outsourced critical government services to friends and supporters who are more connected than they are qualified  that's why  in the senate  i worked with republican senator tom coburn to pass legislation that restricts the use of no bid contracts when it comes to rebuilding the gulf coast  but we need to do more  when our government gives halliburton   billion in taxpayer dollars to put out iraqi oil fires that don't exist  when we hand over katrina contracts to more of george bush's fema friends  it doesn't just violate the american people's trust  it takes away the tax dollars they've earned and the valuable services they need  it's wrong  and when i am president  it will end  third  we will institute an absolute gift ban so that no registered lobbyist can curry favor and build relationships with members of my administration based on how much they can spend  when the american people have a concern about the high cost of health care or college tuition  they can't afford to take a white house staffer out to a fancy dinner or an expensive sporting event  and lobbyists shouldn't get to either  fourth  when it comes to hiring people in my administration  the litmus test we'll apply will not be based on party or ideology  but qualification and experience  this has been the most politicized white house in history  and the american people have suffered as a result  presidents obviously want to surround themselves with those who share their views and their beliefs  but the days of firing eight qualified u s  attorneys because of their politics is over  the days of using the white house as another arm of the republican national committee are over  and the days of michael brown  arabian horse judge  are over  finally  we will return government to the people by bringing government to the people   by making it open and transparent so that anyone can see that our business is the people's business  as justice louis brandeis once said  sunlight is the greatest disinfectant  the more people know about how federal laws  rules and regulations are made  and who's making them  the less likely it is that critical decisions will be hijacked by lobbyists and special interests  i think the current administration knows that  too  which is why it's been the most defiantly secretive government in modern times  it's time to change that  when there is a bill that ends up on my desk as president  you will have five days to look online and find out what's in it before i sign it  when there are meetings between lobbyists and a government agency  we won't be going to the supreme court to keep it secret like dick cheney and his energy task force  we'll be putting them up on the internet for every american to watch  and instead of allowing lobbyists to slip big corporate tax breaks into bills during the dead of night  we will make sure every single tax break and earmark is available to every american online  this builds on the  google for government  law i passed in congress  which already allows you to see every contract  every grant  every dime of federal spending online  it's time to renew a people's politics in this country   to ensure that the hopes and concerns of average americans speak louder in washington than the hallway whispers of high priced lobbyists  in   over   billion was spent lobbying the federal government  that amounts to over   million per member of congress    million so that oil companies can still run our energy policy and pharmaceutical companies can still inflate our drug prices and special interests can still waste our tax dollars  the american people don't have that kind of money to spend on washington  but they shouldn't have to  in our democracy  the price of access and influence should be nothing more than your voice and your vote  that should be enough for health care reform  that should be enough for a real energy policy  that should be enough to ensure that our government is still the defender of fairness and opportunity for every american  that's the country we're working towards right now  and that's the country i'll fight for every day as your president  early in his presidency  teddy roosevelt gave a famous speech before farmers and factory workers that laid out his vision of what government at its best should be  he said   the welfare of each of us is dependent fundamentally upon the welfare of all of us  and therefore in public life  that man is the best representative whose endeavor it is not to represent any special class or interest  but to represent all by working for our common country  it's time to get to work once more for our common country  it's time we had a politics that reflected that commitment  and it's time we had a president who can get it done  i look forward to being that president  and working with all of you to make this america happen  thank you   em as prepared for delivery em "], ["obama1", "it's great to be here  i've been speaking to a lot of churches recently  so it's nice to be speaking to one that's so familiar  i understand you switched venues at considerable expense and inconvenience because of unfair labor practices at the place you were going to be having this synod  clearly  the past   years have not weakened your resolve as faithful witnesses of the gospel  and i'm glad to see that  it's been several months now since i announced i was running for president  in that time  i've had the chance to talk with americans all across this country  and i've found that no matter where i am  or who i'm talking to  there's a common theme that emerges  it's that folks are hungry for change   they're hungry for something new  they're ready to turn the page on the old politics and the old policies   whether it's the war in iraq or the health care crisis we're in  or a school system that's leaving too many kids behind despite the slogans  but i also get the sense that there's a hunger that's deeper than that   a hunger that goes beyond any single cause or issue  it seems to me that each day  thousands of americans are going about their lives   dropping the kids off at school  driving to work  shopping at the mall  trying to stay on their diets  trying to kick a cigarette habit   and they're coming to the realization that something is missing  they're deciding that their work  their possessions  their diversions  their sheer busyness  is not enough  they want a sense of purpose  a narrative arc to their lives  they're looking to relieve a chronic loneliness  and so they need an assurance that somebody out there cares about them  is listening to them   that they are not just destined to travel down that long road toward nothingness  and this restlessness   this search for meaning   is familiar to me  i was not raised in a particularly religious household  my father  who i didn't know  returned to kenya when i was just two  he was nominally a muslim since there were a number of muslims in the village where he was born  but by the time he was a young adult  he was an atheist  my mother  whose parents were non practicing baptists and methodists  was one of the most spiritual souls i ever knew  she had this enormous capacity for wonder  and lived by the golden rule  but she had a healthy skepticism of religion as an institution  and as a consequence  so did i  it wasn't until after college  when i went to chicago to work as a community organizer for a group of christian churches  that i confronted my own spiritual dilemma  in a sense  what brought me to chicago in the first place was a hunger for some sort of meaning in my life  i wanted to be part of something larger  i'd been inspired by the civil rights movement   by all the clear eyed  straight backed  courageous young people who'd boarded buses and traveled down south to march and sit at lunch counters  and lay down their lives in some cases for freedom  i was too young to be involved in that movement  but i felt i could play a small part in the continuing battle for justice by helping rebuild some of chicago's poorest neighborhoods  so it's   and i'm in chicago  and i'm working with these churches  and with lots of laypeople who are much older than i am  and i found that i recognized in these folks a part of myself  i learned that everyone's got a sacred story when you take the time to listen  and i think they recognized a part of themselves in me too  they saw that i knew the scriptures and that many of the values i held and that propelled me in my work were values they shared  but i think they also sensed that a part of me remained removed and detached   that i was an observer in their midst  and slowly  i came to realize that something was missing as well   that without an anchor for my beliefs  without a commitment to a particular community of faith  at some level i would always remain apart  and alone  and it's around this time that some pastors i was working with came up to me and asked if i was a member of a church   if you're organizing churches  they said   it might be helpful if you went to church once in a while  and i thought   well  i guess that makes sense  so one sunday  i put on one of the few clean jackets i had  and went over to trinity united church of christ on  th street on the south side of chicago  and i heard reverend jeremiah a  wright deliver a sermon called  the audacity of hope  and during the course of that sermon  he introduced me to someone named jesus christ  i learned that my sins could be redeemed  i learned that those things i was too weak to accomplish myself  he would accomplish with me if i placed my trust in him  and in time  i came to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death  but rather as an active  palpable agent in the world and in my own life  it was because of these newfound understandings that i was finally able to walk down the aisle of trinity one day and affirm my christian faith  it came about as a choice  and not an epiphany  i didn't fall out in church  as folks sometimes do  the questions i had didn't magically disappear  the skeptical bent of my mind didn't suddenly vanish  but kneeling beneath that cross on the south side  i felt i heard god's spirit beckoning me  i submitted myself to his will  and dedicated myself to discovering his truth and carrying out his works  but my journey is part of a larger journey   one shared by all who've ever sought to apply the values of their faith to our society  it's a journey that takes us back to our nation's founding  when none other than a ucc church inspired the boston tea party and helped bring an empire to its knees  in the following century  men and women of faith waded into the battles over prison reform and temperance  public education and women's rights   and above all  abolition  and when the civil war was fought and our country dedicated itself to a new birth of freedom  they took on the problems of an industrializing nation   fighting the crimes against society and the sins against god that they felt were being committed in our factories and in our slums  and when these battles were overtaken by others and when the wars they opposed were waged and won  these faithful foot soldiers for justice kept marching  they stood on the edmund pettus bridge  as the blows of billy clubs rained down  they held vigils across this country when four little girls were killed in the  th street baptist church  they cheered on the steps of the lincoln memorial when dr  king delivered his prayer for our country  and in all these ways  they helped make this country more decent and more just  so doing the lord's work is a thread that's run through our politics since the very beginning  and it puts the lie to the notion that the separation of church and state in america means faith should have no role in public life  imagine lincoln's second inaugural without its reference to  the judgments of the lord  or king's  i have a dream  speech without its reference to  all of god's children  or president kennedy's inaugural without the words   here on earth  god's work must truly be our own  at each of these junctures  by summoning a higher truth and embracing a universal faith  our leaders inspired ordinary people to achieve extraordinary things  but somehow  somewhere along the way  faith stopped being used to bring us together and started being used to drive us apart  it got hijacked  part of it's because of the so called leaders of the christian right  who've been all too eager to exploit what divides us  at every opportunity  they've told evangelical christians that democrats disrespect their values and dislike their church  while suggesting to the rest of the country that religious americans care only about issues like abortion and gay marriage  school prayer and intelligent design  there was even a time when the christian coalition determined that its number one legislative priority was tax cuts for the rich  i don't know what bible they're reading  but it doesn't jibe with my version  but i'm hopeful because i think there's an awakening taking place in america  people are coming together around a simple truth   that we are all connected  that i am my brother's keeper  i am my sister's keeper  and that it's not enough to just believe this   we have to do our part to make it a reality  my faith teaches me that i can sit in church and pray all i want  but i won't be fulfilling god's will unless i go out and do the lord's work  that's why pastors  friends of mine like rick warren and t d  jakes and organizations like world vision and catholic charities are wielding their enormous influence to confront poverty  hiv aids  and the genocide in darfur  religious leaders like my friends rev  jim wallis and rabbi david saperstein and nathan diament are working for justice and fighting for change  and all across the country  communities of faith are sponsoring day care programs  building senior centers  and in so many other ways  taking part in the project of american renewal  yet what we also understand is that our values should express themselves not just through our churches or synagogues  temples or mosques  they should express themselves through our government  because whether it's poverty or racism  the uninsured or the unemployed  war or peace  the challenges we face today are not simply technical problems in search of the perfect ten point plan  they are moral problems  rooted in both societal indifference and individual callousness   in the imperfections of man  and so long as we're not doing everything in our personal and collective power to solve them  we know the conscience of our nation cannot rest  our conscience can't rest so long as   million americans are poor and forgotten by their leaders in washington and by the media elites  we need to heed the biblical call to care for  the least of these  and lift the poor out of despair  that's why i've been fighting to expand the earned income tax credit and the minimum wage  if you're working forty hours a week  you shouldn't be living in poverty  but we also know that government initiatives are not enough  each of us in our own lives needs to do what we can to help the poor  and until we do  our conscience cannot rest  our conscience cannot rest so long as nearly   million americans don't have health insurance and the millions more who do are going bankrupt trying to pay for it  i have made a solemn pledge that i will sign a universal health care bill into law by the end of my first term as president that will cover every american and cut the cost of a typical family's premiums by up to   a year  that's not simply a matter of policy or ideology   it's a moral commitment  and until we stop the genocide that's being carried out in darfur as i speak  our conscience cannot rest  this is a problem that's brought together churches and synagogues and mosques and people of all faiths as part of a grassroots movement  universities and states  including illinois  are taking part in a divestment campaign to pressure the sudanese government to stop the killings  it's not enough  but it's helping  and it's a testament to what we can achieve when good people with strong convictions stand up for their beliefs  and we should close guantanamo bay and stop tolerating the torture of our enemies  because it's not who we are  it's not consistent with our traditions of justice and fairness  and it offends our conscience  but we also know our conscience cannot rest so long as the war goes on in iraq  it's a war i'm proud i opposed from the start   a war that should never have been authorized and never been waged  i have a plan that would have already begun redeploying our troops with the goal of bringing all our combat brigades home by march  st of next year  the president vetoed a similar plan  but he doesn't have the last word  and we're going to keep at it  until we bring this war to an end  because the iraq war is not just a security problem  it's a moral problem  and there's another issue we must confront as well  today there are   million undocumented immigrants in america  most of them working in our communities  attending our churches  and contributing to our country  now  as children of god  we believe in the worth and dignity of every human being  it doesn't matter where that person came from or what documents they have  we believe that everyone  everywhere should be loved  and given the chance to work  and raise a family  but as americans  we also know that this is a nation of laws  and we cannot have those laws broken when more than   people cross our borders illegally every day  we cannot ignore that we have a right and a duty to protect our borders  and we cannot ignore the very real concerns of americans who are not worried about illegal immigration because they are racist or xenophobic  but because they fear it will result in lower wages when they're already struggling to raise their families  and so this will be a difficult debate next week  consensus and compromise will not come easy  last time we took up immigration reform  it failed  but we cannot walk away this time  our conscience cannot rest until we not only secure our borders  but give the   million undocumented immigrants in this country a chance to earn their citizenship by paying a fine and waiting in line behind all those who came here legally  we will all have to make concessions to achieve this  that's what compromise is about  but at the end of the day  we cannot walk away   not for the sake of passing a bill  but so that we can finally address the real concerns of americans and the persistent hopes of all those brothers and sisters who want nothing more than their own chance at our common dream  these are some of the challenges that test our conscience   as americans and people of faith  and meeting them won't be easy  there is real evil and hardship and pain and suffering in the world and we should be humble in our belief that we can eliminate them  but we shouldn't use our humility as an excuse for inaction  we shouldn't use the obstacles we face as an excuse for cynicism  we have to do what we can  knowing it's hard and not swinging from a na ve idealism to a bitter defeatism   but rather  accepting the fact that we're not going to solve every problem overnight  but we can still make a difference  we can recognize the truth that's at the heart of the ucc  that the conversation is not over  that our roles are not defined  that through ancient texts and modern voices  god is still speaking  challenging us to change not just our own lives  but the world around us  i'm hearing from evangelicals who may not agree with progressives on every issue but agree that poverty has no place in a world of plenty  that hate has no place in the hearts of believers  and that we all have to be good stewards of god's creations  from willow creek to the 'emerging church ' from the southern baptist convention to the national association of evangelicals  folks are realizing that the four walls of the church are too small for a big god  god is still speaking  i'm hearing from progressives who understand that if we want to communicate our hopes and values to americans  we can't abandon the field of religious discourse  that's why organizations are rising up across the country to reclaim the language of faith to bring about change  god is still speaking  he's still speaking to our catholic friends   who are holding up a consistent ethic of life that goes beyond abortion   one that includes a respect for life and dignity whether it's in iraq  in poor neighborhoods  in african villages or even on death row  they're telling me that their conversation about what it means to be catholic continues  god is still speaking  and right here in the ucc  we're hearing from god about what it means to be a welcoming church that holds on to our christian witness  the ucc is still listening  and god is still speaking  now  some of you may have heard me talk about the joshua generation  but there's a story i want to share that takes place before moses passed the mantle of leadership on to joshua  it comes from deuteronomy   when moses talks to his followers about the challenges they'll find when they reach the promised land without him  to the joshua generation  these challenges seem momentous   and they are  but moses says  what i am commanding you is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach  it is not up in heaven  nor is it beyond the sea  no  the word is very near  it is on your lips and in your heart  it's an idea that's often forgotten or dismissed in cynical times  it's that we all have it within our power to make this a better world  because we all have the capacity to do justice and show mercy  to treat others with dignity and respect  and to rise above what divides us and come together to meet those challenges we can't meet alone  it's the wisdom moses imparted to those who would succeed him  and it's a lesson we need to remember today   as members of another joshua generation  so let's rededicate ourselves to a new kind of politics   a politics of conscience  let's come together   protestant and catholic  muslim and hindu and jew  believer and non believer alike  we're not going to agree on everything  but we can disagree without being disagreeable  we can affirm our faith without endangering the separation of church and state  as long as we understand that when we're in the public square  we have to speak in universal terms that everyone can understand  and if we can do that   if we can embrace a common destiny   then i believe we'll not just help bring about a more hopeful day in america  we'll not just be caring for our own souls  we'll be doing god's work here on earth  thank you   em as prepared for delivery em "], ["obama1", "over the last few years  i've been traveling to different schools and meeting with all kinds of educators to hear about what's working  what's not  what makes the difference when it comes to educating children today i've gained a lot of valuable insight from these visits  but one i'll always remember is my trip to dodge elementary school in my hometown of chicago  i was talking to one of the young teachers there about the challenges they faced  and she mentioned what she called the  these kids syndrome    the willingness of society to find a million excuses for why  these kids  can't learn  it's the idea that  these kids come from tough backgrounds  or that  these kids are too far behind  and after awhile   these kids  become somebody else's problem  then she said to me   when i hear that term  it drives me nuts  they're not 'these kids ' they're our kids our kids are why all of you are in this room today  our kids are why you wake up wondering how you'll make a difference and go to bed thinking about tomorrow's lesson plan  our kids are why you walk into that classroom every day even when you're not getting the support  or the pay  or the respect that you deserve   because you believe that every child should have a chance to succeed  that every child can be taught you've made our kids your life's work  and i believe it's time we put that work at the center of our politics once more we have never been a  these kids  country  from the earliest days of our founding  we have believed in thomas jefferson's declaration that  talent and virtue  needed in a free society  should be educated regardless of wealth  birth or other accidental condition it is this belief that led our country to set up the first free public schools in small new england towns  it's a promise we kept as we moved from a nation of farms to factories and created a system of public high schools so that everyone had the chance to succeed in the new economy  one we expanded after world war ii  when we sent over two million returning heroes to college on the gi bill and even when america fell short of this ideal and forced linda brown to walk miles to a dilapidated topeka school because of the color of her skin  even then  ordinary people marched and bled  they took to the streets and fought in the courts until the arrival of nine little children at a little rock school made real the decision that in america  separate could never be equal  and no matter what the supreme court said last week  that's still true today the ideal of a public education has always been at the heart of the american promise  it's why we are committed to fixing and improving our public schools instead of abandoning them and passing out vouchers  because in america  it's the promise of a good education for all that makes it possible for any child to transcend the barriers of race or class or background and achieve their god given potential that's how america works  that's how we've met each challenge that has come our way  we rise together  as one people  and together is how teachers  education support professionals  students  and the american people will meet the challenges we face today  we now live in a world where the most valuable skill you can sell is knowledge  revolutions in technology and communication have created an entire economy of high tech  high wage jobs that can be located anywhere there's an internet connection  and today  a child in philadelphia is not only competing for jobs with one in boston  but thousands more in bangalore and beijing who are being educated longer and better than ever before in the  st century  countries who out educate us today will out compete us tomorrow  and america is already in danger of falling behind  we now have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation  by  th grade  our children score lower on their math and science tests than most other kids in the developed world  sixty percent of african american fourth graders are unable to read at a basic level  and today only   of low income students will graduate from college forty or fifty years ago  students who had trouble in school might have gone on to find a factory job that could pay the bills and support a family  but we no longer live in that world  today  the average salary of a high school graduate is only   a year  for high school dropouts  it's even closer to the poverty line   just   a year  and sadly  some folks here aren't paid that much and that's wrong this is not only morally unacceptable for our children  it is economically untenable for our nation  and it means that today  the work you do and the difference you make has never been more important to the future of this country in fact  new evidence shows that from the moment our children step into a classroom  the single most important factor in determining their achievement is not the color of their skin or where they come from  it's not who their parents are or how much money they have it's who their teacher is  it's you  it's you who can reach the most challenging students  it's you who will stay past the last bell and spend your own money on books and supplies  it's you who will go beyond the call because you believe that's what makes the extra difference  and it does but you can't do it alone  and it's about time that washington realized that  for too long  our politics has been stuck in a cycle where we praise our educators in speeches and photo ops  but then abandon them when it comes time to offer the resources and the support you need to do your jobs there's no better example of this neglect than the law that has become one of the emptiest slogans in the history of politics   no child left behind now  we all know that the goals of this law were the right ones  we know that making a promise to educate every child with an excellent teacher is right  we know that accountability and standards are right  we know that it's right to close the achievement gap that exists in too many cities and towns  and that it's right to focus on the inequitable distribution of resources and qualified teachers in our schools  we didn't need some words in a law to tell us this  we already knew it  and every one of us is still willing to do whatever it takes to make these goals a reality but don't come up with this law called no child left behind and then leave the money behind  don't tell us that you'll put high quality teachers in every classroom and then leave the support and the pay for those teachers behind  don't label a school as failing one day and then throw your hands up and walk away from it the next  and don't tell us that the only way to teach a child is to spend too much of the year preparing him to fill in a few bubbles on a standardized test  we know that's not true  you didn't devote your lives to testing  you devoted them to teaching  and teaching is what you should be allowed to do this is what i'll be trying to leave behind when no child left behind comes before the senate for renewal  and if we don't fix the law then  i can assure you this   i will when i'm president  let's leave behind that empty slogan but i'll also say this   fixing the worst aspects of no child left behind is just a starting point  the status quo is still unacceptable for teachers and students  in the face of a global economy where too many children start behind and stay behind  this country doesn't need more blame or inaction or half measures on education  what we need is a historic commitment to america's teachers  and that's the kind of commitment i intend to make as president we know that we have more than one million teachers who are set to retire and more kids entering school than ever before  and so we know that it's time to recruit a new generation of teachers and principals  let's do this by finally raising salaries across the board  and making it possible for professionals in other fields to become teachers  not through easy shortcuts  but through programs that allow new teachers to learn from veteran professionals  and if you're willing to put yourself through college to make the sacrifice and commitment that teaching requires  we should be willing to help you pay off some of those college loans in the coming weeks  i'll be laying out the specific details of my plan to invest billions of new dollars into the teaching profession and recruit an army of well trained  well qualified teachers who are willing to stand at the front of any classroom and give every student the chance to succeed my view is this   if we truly believe that educators are the essential professionals that we know you are  then it's time we rewarded  and supported  and honored the professional excellence you show every day we know what we need to do here we also know that right now  we need the best teachers in the most challenging classrooms   those underserved  underachieving schools in parts of rural and urban america where we need to make  these kids   our kids  again i believe in collective bargaining  and i believe that any time you're talking about wages  workers have to be at the table so let's make a promise right now that if you're a teacher or a principal doing the hard work of educating our children  we will reward that work with the salary increase that you deserve  if you're willing to teach in a high need subject like math or science or special education  we'll pay you even more if you're willing to take on more responsibilities like mentoring  we'll pay you more and if you excel at helping your students achieve success  your success will be valued and rewarded as well  here's the key  we can find new ways to increase pay that are developed with teachers  not imposed on them and not based on some arbitrary test score  that's how we're going to close the achievement gap that exists in this country and that's how we're going to start treating teachers like the professionals you are i commend the work you've done in minnesota with the governor there to craft an innovative pay system that not only values your performance in the classroom  but the performance of your students as well  you helped craft it and you and your students benefit from it we also know that when it comes to struggling schools  it's not just how much you're getting paid that matters  but how much support you're getting to do your job  we know that when you pair experienced  mentor teachers with new teachers  those new teachers are much more likely to stay in the profession  so let's make sure we start developing more mentor teachers so we can start recruiting and keeping the new generation of teachers we need and while we're at it  let's work with teachers and principals to finally develop assessments that teach our kids to become more than just good test takers  the goal of educational testing should be the same as medical testing   to diagnose a student's needs so you can help address them  tests should not be designed as punishment for teachers and students  they should be used as tools to help prepare our children to grow and compete in a knowledge economy  tests should support learning  not just accounting one last point  there's a lot of talk out there about accountability in education  i share that concern  and i've called for more accountability in our schools myself  but i also believe that before we can hold our teachers accountable for the results our schools need  we have to hold ourselves accountable for giving teachers the support that they need  that's where accountability starts with a government that puts its money where its mouth is  and parents and community members who instill the value of education in their students  i am tired of hearing teachers blamed for our collective failures a few months ago  i had the opportunity to take a bus ride with a group of iowa teachers and discuss their thoughts on education  afterwards  one teacher said   i don't think any teacher minds being accountable when the measuring tool is fair to educators and not about satisfying unrealistic goals she's right  if we do all this   if we go into struggling schools and provide more pay and better support for our teachers  if we allow them to teach our children to their strengths instead of just a test   then the teachers i've met wouldn't mind some accountability but we need to start doing our part first  when it comes to education in america  we need to start holding ourselves accountable  this goes for our government and our leaders  it also goes for parents  there is no policy or program that can substitute for a parent who is deeply involved in their child's education from day one   who is willing to turn off the tv  put away the video games  and read to their child  or help with homework  or attend those parent teacher conferences  as parents too  many of you know what i'm talking about here a few years ago  a little girl at earhart elementary in chicago was asked the secret to her academic success she said   i just study hard every night because i like learning  my teacher wants me to be a good student  and so does my mother  i don't want to let them down we have quite a challenge ahead of us  but we've overcome great challenges before  over the course of two centuries  we have continually upheld the promise of education for all as that which allows any child to transcend the barriers of race or class or background and achieve their god given potential  and we have risen together as a result it is teachers and education support professionals who have always made this possible   who have always reminded us that that little girl in chicago is not 'these kids'  she is our child  she doesn't want to let us down  and now it is our generation's turn to ensure that we won't let her down either  i know you'll be leading the way  and i look forward to standing with you in the fight  thank you em as prepared for delivery em "], ["obama1", "it's been four decades since bobby kennedy crouched in a shack along the mississippi delta and looked into the wide  listless eyes of a hungry child  again and again he tried to talk to this child  but each time his efforts were met with only a blank stare of desperation  and when kennedy turned to the reporters traveling with him  with tears in his eyes he asked a single question about poverty in america   how can a country like this allow it  forty years later  we're still asking that question  it echoes on the streets of compton and detroit  and throughout the mining towns of west virginia  it lingers

earth  decisions are made on both ends of pennsylvania avenue that shape lives and set the course of history  with the stroke of a pen  billions are spent on programs and policies  on tax breaks for those who didn't need them and a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged  debates rage and accusations fly and at the end of each day  the petty sniping is what lights up the evening news  and yet here  on the other side of the river  every other child in anacostia lives below the poverty line  too many do not graduate and too many more do not find work  some join gangs  and others fall to their gunfire  the streets here are close to our capital  but far from the people it represents  these americans cannot hire lobbyists to roam the halls of congress on their behalf  and they cannot write thousand dollar campaign checks to make their voices heard  they suffer most from a politics that has been tipped in favor of those with the most money  and influence  and power  how can a country like this allow it  no matter how many times it's asked or what the circumstances are  the most american answer i can think of to that question is two words   we can't  we can't allow this kind of suffering and hopelessness to exist in our country  we can't afford to lose a generation of tomorrow's doctors and scientists and teachers to poverty  we can make excuses for it or we can fight about it or we can ignore poverty altogether  but as long as it's here it will always be a betrayal of the ideals we hold as americans  it's not who we are  in this country   of all countries   no child's destiny should be determined before he takes his first step  no little girl's future should be confined to the neighborhood she was born into  our government cannot guarantee success and happiness in life  but what we can do as a nation is to ensure that every american who wants to work is prepared to work  able to find a job  and able to stay out of poverty  what we can do is make our neighborhoods whole again  what we can do is retire the phrase  working poor  in our time  that's what we can do  because that's who we are  the challenge is greater than it has been in generations  but that's all the more reason for this generation to act  one in every eight americans now lives in poverty  a rate that has nearly doubled since   that's an income of about   a year for a family of four  one in three americans   one in every three   is now classified as low income  that's   a year for a family of four  today's economy has made it easier to fall into poverty  the fall is often more precipitous and more permanent than ever before  you used to be able to find a good job without a degree from college or even high school  today that's nearly impossible  you used to be able to count on your job to be there for your entire life  today almost any job can be shipped overseas in an instant  the jobs that remain are paying less and offering fewer benefits  as employers have succeeded in busting up unions and cutting back on health care and pensions to stay competitive with the companies abroad that are paying their workers next to nothing  every american is vulnerable to the insecurities and anxieties of this new economy  and that's why the single most important focus of my economic agenda as president will be to pursue policies that create jobs and make work pay  this means investing in education from early childhood through college  so our workers are ready to compete with any workers for the best jobs the world has to offer  it means investing more in research  science  and technology so that those new jobs and those new industries are created right here in america  and while we can't stop every job from going overseas  we can stop giving tax breaks to the companies who send them there and start giving them to companies who create jobs at home  we can also start making sure these jobs keep folks out of poverty  when i'm president  i will raise the minimum wage and make it a living wage by making sure that it rises every time the cost of living does  i'll start letting our unions do what they do best again   organize our workers and lift up our middle class  and i'll finally make sure every american has affordable health care that stays with you no matter what happens by passing my plan to provide universal coverage and cut the cost of health care by up to   per family  all of these policies will give more families a chance to grab hold of the ladder to middle class security  and they'll make the climb a little easier  but poverty is not just a function of simple economics  it's also a matter of where you live  there are vast swaths of rural america and block after block in our cities where poverty is not just a crisis that hits pocketbooks  but a disease that infects every corner of the community  i will be outlining my rural agenda in the coming weeks  but today i want to talk about what we can do as a nation to combat the poverty that persists in our cities  this kind of poverty is not an issue i just discovered for the purposes of a campaign  it is the cause that led me to a life of public service almost twenty five years ago  i was just two years out of college when i first moved to the south side of chicago to become a community organizer  i was hired by a group of churches that were trying to deal with steel plant closures that had devastated the surrounding neighborhoods  everywhere you looked  businesses were boarded up and schools were crumbling and teenagers were standing aimlessly on street corners  without jobs and without hope  what's most overwhelming about urban poverty is that it's so difficult to escape   it's isolating and it's everywhere  if you are an african american child unlucky enough to be born into one of these neighborhoods  you are most likely to start life hungry or malnourished  you are less likely to start with a father in your household  and if he is there  there's a fifty fifty chance that he never finished high school and the same chance he doesn't have a job  your school isn't likely to have the right books or the best teachers  you're more likely to encounter gang activities than after school activities  and if you can't find a job because the most successful businessman in your neighborhood is a drug dealer  you're more likely to join that gang yourself  opportunity is scarce  role models are few  and there is little contact with the normalcy of life outside those streets  what you learn when you spend your time in these neighborhoods trying to solve these problems is that there are no easy solutions and no perfect arguments  and you come to understand that for the last four decades  both ends of the political spectrum have been talking past one another  it's true that there were many effective programs that emerged from lyndon johnson's war on poverty  but there were also some ineffective programs that were defended anyway  as well as an inability of some on the left to acknowledge that the problems of absent fathers or persistent crime were indeed problems that needed to be addressed  the right has often seized on these failings as proof that the government can't and shouldn't do a thing about poverty   that it is a result of individual moral failings and cultural pathologies and so we should just sit back and let these cities fend for themselves  and so ronald reagan launched his assault on welfare queens  and george bush spent the last six years slashing programs to combat poverty  and job training  and substance abuse  and child abuse  well  we know that's not the answer  when you're in these neighborhoods  you can see what a difference it makes to have a government that cares  you can see what a free lunch program does for a hungry child  you can see what a little extra money from an earned income tax credit does for a family that's struggling  you can see what prenatal care does for the health of a mother and a newborn  so don't tell me there's no role for government in lifting up our cities  but you can also see what a difference it makes when people start caring for themselves  it makes a difference when a father realizes that responsibility does not end at conception  when he understands that what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child but the courage to raise one  it makes a difference when a parent turns off the tv once in awhile  puts away the video games  and starts reading to their child  and getting involved in his education  it makes a difference when we realize that a child who shoots another child has a hole in his heart that no government can fill  that makes a difference  so there are no easy answers and perfect arguments  as dr  king said  it is not either or  it is both and  hope is not found in any single ideology   an insistence on doing the same thing with the same result year after year  hope is found in what works  in those south side neighborhoods  hope was found in the after school programs we created  and the job training programs we put together  and the organizing skills we taught residents so that they could stand up to a government that wasn't standing up for them  hope is found here at thearc  where you've provided thousands of children with shelter from the streets and a home away from home  and if you travel a few hours north of here  you will find hope amid ninety seven neighborhood blocks in the heart of harlem  this is the home of the harlem children's zone   an all encompassing  all hands on deck anti poverty effort that is literally saving a generation of children in a neighborhood where they were never supposed to have a chance  the philosophy behind the project is simple   if poverty is a disease that infects an entire community in the form of unemployment and violence  failing schools and broken homes  then we can't just treat those symptoms in isolation  we have to heal that entire community  and we have to focus on what actually works  if you're a child who's born in the harlem children's zone  you start life differently than other inner city children  your parents probably went to what they call   baby college  a place where they received counseling on how to care for newborns and what to expect in those first months  you start school right away  because there's early childhood education  when your parents are at work  you have a safe place to play and learn  because there's child care  and after school programs  even in the summer  there are innovative charter schools to attend  there's free medical services that offer care when you're sick and preventive services to stay healthy  there's affordable  good food available so you're not malnourished  there are job counselors and financial counselors  there's technology training and crime prevention  you don't just sign up for this program  you're actively recruited for it  because the idea is that if everyone is involved  and no one slips through the cracks  then you really can change an entire community  geoffrey canada  the program's inspirational  innovative founder  put it best   instead of helping some kids beat the odds  the harlem children's zone is actually changing the odds altogether  and it's working  parents in harlem are actually reading more to their children  their kids are staying in school and passing statewide tests at higher rates than other children in new york city  they're going to college in a place where it was once unheard of  they've even placed third at a national chess championship  so we know this works  and if we know it works  there's no reason this program should stop at the end of those blocks in harlem  it's time to change the odds for neighborhoods all across america  and that's why when i'm president  the first part of my plan to combat urban poverty will be to replicate the harlem children's zone in twenty cities across the country  we'll train staff  we'll have them draw up detailed plans with attainable goals  and the federal government will provide half of the funding for each city  with the rest coming from philanthropies and businesses  now  how much will this cost  i'll be honest   it can't be done on the cheap  it will cost a few billion dollars a year  we won't just spend the money because we can   every step these cities take will be evaluated  and if certain plans or programs aren't working  we will stop them and try something else  but we will find the money to do this because we can't afford not to  dr  king once remarked that if we can find the money to put a man on the moon  then we can find the money to put a man on his own two feet  there's no reason we should be spending tens of thousands of dollars a year to imprison one of these kids when they turn eighteen when we could be spending   to turn their lives around with this program  and to really put it in perspective  think of it this way  the harlem children's zone is saving a generation of children for   million a year  that's about what the war in iraq costs american taxpayers every four hours  so let's invest this money  let's change the odds in urban america by focusing on what works  the second part of my plan will do this by providing families the support they need to raise their children  i'll pass the plan i outlined last year that will provide more financial support to fathers who make the responsible choice to help raise their children and crack down on the fathers who don't  and we'll help new mothers with their new responsibilities by expanding a pioneering program known as the nurse family partnership that offers home visits by trained registered nurses to low income mothers and mothers to be  this program has been proven to reduce childhood injuries  unintended pregnancies  and the use of welfare and food stamps  it's increased father involvement  women's employment  and children's school readiness  it's produced more than   in net savings for every high risk family enrolled in the program  it works  and i'll expand the program to   first time mothers each year  the third part of my plan for urban america is to help people find work and make that work pay  i will invest   billion over five years in innovative transitional jobs programs that have been highly successful at placing the unemployed into temporary jobs and then training them for permanent ones  people in these programs get the chance to work in a community service type job  earn a paycheck every week  and learn the skills they need for gainful employment  and by leaving with references and a resume  often times they find that employment  still  even for those workers who do find a permanent job  many times there's no way for them to advance their careers once they're in those jobs  that's why we'll also work with community organizations and businesses to create career pathways that provide workers with the additional skills and training they need to earn more money  and we'll make sure that public transportation is both available and affordable for low income workers  because no one should be denied work in this country because they can't get there  to make work pay  i will also triple the earned income tax credit for full time workers making the minimum wage  this is one of the most successful anti poverty programs in history and lifts nearly   million americans out of poverty every year  i was able to expand this program when i was a state senator in illinois  and as president i'll do it again  the fourth part of my plan will be to help bring businesses back to our inner cities  a long time ago  this country created a world bank that has helped spur economic development in some of the world's poorest regions  i think it's about time we had something like that right here in america  less than one percent of the   billion in venture capital that's invested each year goes to minority businesses that are trying to breathe life into our cities  this has to change  when i'm president  i'll make sure that every community has the access to the capital and resources it needs to create a stronger business climate by providing more loans to small businesses and setting up the financial institutions that can help get them started  i'll also create a national network of business incubators  which are local services that help first time business owners design their business plans  find the best location  and receive expert advice on how to run their businesses whenever they need it  and i will take steps to help close the digital divide and increase internet access for cities so that urban america is just as connected as the rest of america  the final part of my plan to change the odds in our cities will be to ensure that more americans have access to safe  affordable housing  as president  i'll create an affordable housing trust fund that would add as many as   new affordable units in mixed income neighborhoods  we'll also do more to protect homeowners from mortgage fraud and subprime lending by passing my plan to provide counseling to tenants  homeowners  and other consumers so they get the advice and guidance they need before buying a house and support if they get in to trouble down the road  and we will crack down on mortgage professionals found guilty of fraud by increasing enforcement and creating new criminal penalties  what this agenda to combat urban poverty attempts to do is not easy  and it will not happen overnight  changing the odds in our cities will require humility in what we can accomplish and patience with our progress  but most importantly  it will require the sustained commitment of the president of the united states  and that is why i will also appoint a new director of urban policy who will cut through the disorganized bureaucracy that currently exists and report directly to me on how these efforts are going  on what's working and what's not  because in the end  hope is found in what works  the moral question about poverty in america   how can a country like this allow it    has an easy answer  we can't  the political question that follows   what do we do about it    has always been more difficult  but now that we're finally seeing the beginnings of an answer  this country has an obligation to keep trying  the idea for the harlem children's zone began with a list  it was a waiting list that geoffrey canada kept of all the children who couldn't get into his program back when it was just a few blocks wide  it was   people long  and one day he looked at that list and thought  why shouldn't those   kids get the same chance in life as the   who were already in the program  why not expand it to include those   why not   why not  and that  of course  is the final question about poverty in america  it's the hopeful one that bobby kennedy was also famous for asking  why not  it leaves the cynics without an answer  and it calls on the rest of us to get to work  i will be doing exactly that from the first day i become your president  and i ask you all to join me in getting it done  thank you   em as prepared for delivery em "], ["obama1", "i have been running for president now for a little over five months  and in that time  i have been inspired by crowds tens of thousands of people strong   many who have come out for the very first political event of their lifetime  we have seen more americans sign up and contribute so far than any other campaign in history  they are young and old  republican and democrat  white  and black  and latino  i'd like to take the all the credit here myself  but as my wife reminds me every day  i'm just not that great  the real reason that so many people are coming out and signing up is because they see in this campaign the potential for the change americans are so hungry for  it's not just the kind of change you hear about in slogans or from politicians every few years  it's the kind of bottom up  grassroots movement that can transform a nation  la raza has always represented this kind of movement  you didn't get your start as some top down interest group in washington  you got your start standing up for the dreams and aspirations of latinos in farm fields and barrios all across america  you got your start almost forty years ago in places like southern california  where farm workers and their children were beaten because they asked for the right to organize   because they believed that picking grapes all day in the hot sun should be rewarded with a decent wage and protection from deadly pesticides  and when a man named cesar chavez saw this injustice  he knew it wasn't right and so he went about organizing those workers  and one fateful day he decided to draw the eyes of the nation to their cause by sitting down for a hunger strike  he went without food for twenty five days  and at one point he received a telegram from an atlanta preacher who was busy leading his own strike of sanitation workers all the way in memphis  tennessee  the telegram from dr  martin luther king  jr  to cesar chavez said this   as brothers in the fight for equality  i extend the hand of fellowship and good will and wish continuing success to you and your members  our separate struggles are really one  a struggle for freedom  for dignity  and for humanity our separate struggles are really one  it was a belief that dr  king repeated often when he would say that an injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere  it means that the civil rights movement wasn't just a movement of african americans  but latino americans  and white americans  and every american who believes that equality and opportunity are not just words to be said but promises to be kept  the civil rights movement was your movement too  and its unfinished work is still the task of every american  our separate struggles are really one  if there's a child stuck in a crumbling school who graduates without ever learning how to read  it doesn't matter if that child is a latino from miami or an african american from chicago or a white girl from rural kentucky   she is our child  and her struggle is our struggle  it doesn't matter if the injustice involves a brown man who's badgered into proving his citizenship again and again or a black man who's pulled over because the car he's driving is too nice   it's injustice either way and we all have a role in ending it  whether you're one of the   million americans without health care in this country  or the one in five african americans  or the one in three latinos  it will take all of us to stand up to a drug and insurance industry that spent   billion in lobbying to block health care reform  that's the kind of movement we need in america  it won't be enough to change parties in this election if we don't also change a politics that has tried to divide us for far too long  because when we spend all our time keeping score of who's up and who's down  the only winners are those who can afford to play the game   those with the most money  and influence  and power  that's why right now  the experience we need in the next president is the proven ability to bring people to the table and get things done  we need a leader who's willing to tell the lobbyists and special interests that while they get a seat at that table  the days of them buying every chair are over  i'm running for president because i have been that kind of leader my entire life i was too young to participate in the civil right movement  but i was inspired by leaders like king and chavez to become a community organizer  almost twenty five years ago  i was hired by a group of churches on the south side of chicago to help turn around neighborhoods that had been devastated by the closing of nearby steel plants  i knew that change wouldn't be easy  but i also knew it would be impossible without bringing folks together and building a movement within the community  so i reached out and formed coalitions between latino leaders and black leaders on every issue from failing schools to illegal dumping to unimmunized children  and together  we made progress  we set up job training and after school programs  and we taught people on the south side to stand up to their government when it wasn't standing up for them  but i didn't stop there  when all the cynics said it wasn't possible  i kept building coalitions and making progress throughout my eight years in the illinois state senate  they told me i couldn't reform a death penalty system that had sent   innocent people to death row  but we did that  they told me that trying to pass new racial profiling laws to protect black folks and brown folks would stir up too much controversy  but we did that too  and they doubted whether we could put government back on the side of average people   but we put   million worth of tax cuts in the pockets of the low income workers and passed health care reform that insured another   children and parents  so i want you to remember one thing  because you'll be hearing from a lot of candidates today  when i talk about hope  when i talk about change  when i talk about holding america up to its ideals of opportunity and equality  this isn't just the rhetoric of a campaign for me  it's been the cause of my life   a cause i will work for and fight for every day as your president  i will be a president who remembers that our separate struggles are really one  i will never walk away from the tough battles or the difficult work of bringing people together  and i will never walk away from the   million undocumented immigrants who live  work  and contribute to our country every single day  there are few better examples of how broken  bitter  and divisive our politics has become than the immigration debate that played out in washington a few weeks ago so many of us   democrats and republicans   were willing to compromise in order to pass comprehensive reform that would secure our borders while giving the undocumented a chance to earn their citizenship  we knew that the american people believe that we are a nation of laws   that we have a right and duty to protect our borders  and we should also crack down on employers who hire undocumented workers so that we can protect jobs and wages  but the american people also know that we are a nation of immigrants   a nation that has always been willing to give weary travelers from around the world the chance to come here and reach for the dream that so many of us have reached for  that's the america that answered my father's letters and his prayers and brought him here from kenya so long ago  that's the america we believe in  but that's the america that the president and too many republicans walked away from when the politics got tough  now  there are plenty of people opposed to immigration reform for principled reasons that i happen to disagree with  but this time around  we saw parts of the immigration debate took a turn that was both ugly and racist in a way we haven't seen since the struggle for civil rights  well we didn't walk away from injustice then and we won't walk away from it today  i'll keep fighting  and i'll keep attending immigration rallies  and i'll keep believing that we can have a civil debate about immigration where we begin to recognize ourselves in one another  and when i'm president  i will put comprehensive immigration reform back on the nation's agenda and i will not rest until it is passed once and for all  but you and i know that the struggle we share goes far beyond immigration  we don't expect our government to guarantee success and happiness  but when millions of children start the race of life so far behind only because of race  only because of class  that's a betrayal of our ideals  that's not just a latino problem or an african american problem  that is an american problem that we have to solve it's an american problem when latinos are the most likely to be uninsured even though they make up a disproportionate share of the workforce  it's an american problem when one in four latinos cannot communicate well with their doctor about what's wrong or fill out medical forms because there are language barriers we refuse to break down  it's an american problem that our health care system is broken and it's time to fix it once and for all  i have a universal health care plan that will cover every american and cut the cost of a typical family's premiums by up to   a year  it's a plan that lets the uninsured buy insurance that's similar to the kind members of congress give themselves  if you can't afford that  you'll get a subsidy to pay for it  and it goes further than any other proposed plan in cutting the cost of health care by investing in technology and preventive care  breaking the stranglehold the drug and insurance industries have on the health care market  and helping business and families shoulder the cost of the most expensive conditions so that an illness doesn't lead to a bankruptcy  and i promise you this   i will sign this universal health care plan by the end of my first term in office as your president  count on it  it's also time for this country to keep the promise of a world class education for every child  because it's an american problem when nearly half of all latino students do not receive a high school diploma  it's an american problem when too many of these students who want to learn english don't have the resources to learn english and are punished as a result  let's give our kids everything they could possibly need to have a fighting chance  let's not pass a law called no child left behind and then leave the money behind  let's finally invest in what makes the most difference in any child's education   the person standing in the front of the classroom  as president  i will launch a campaign to recruit hundreds of thousands of new teachers across the country  and i'll pay them like the professionals they are  and let's make sure any child who comes here and studies here and does well in school gets the same chance to attend a public college as anyone else  i helped pass the dream act in illinois  and i will do the same as president  and there's one other thing we can do  for millions of latinos and other americans  the cornerstone of the american dream is the ability to own your own home  you work hard for it  and you save for it  and you're willing to sacrifice to buy it  but there is an army of lenders and brokers out there who are ready and willing to take advantage of your hopes and cheat you out of your dream  they lurk in your neighborhoods and sometimes they even come into your churches and they offer you these subprime mortgage loans  they make them sound easy and affordable and they tell you to ignore the fine print and ask you to sign on the dotted line  your first couple of payments are ok  but then after months go by  the cost of your monthly payment starts jumping  then it jumps some more  pretty soon you're paying almost all of your income on your housing payments  and eventually  you're forced to foreclose on your dream  and the worst part is that the lenders knew this would happen from day one  a recent report showed that   million sub prime loans made in recent years have failed or will end in foreclosure  costing homeowners as much as   billion  latinos hold up to   percent of these mortgages  african americans hold over half  this is no accident  these loans are discriminatory  they are dishonest  and it's time for us to treat these fraudulent lenders like the criminals that they are  when i am president  i will make law the legislation i've already introduced that would crack down on lenders and brokers found guilty of fraud by increasing enforcement and creating new criminal penalties  we'd also do more to protect homeowners from fraud in the first place by providing them counseling so they get the advice they need both before and after they buy their home  we'll even create an easy to read  easy to understand measurement called the home score that lets you figure out exactly what a mortgage will cost you both initially and down the road  no one should get tricked into losing their home so that some loan shark can make a profit  and i will make sure of that as your president  we can do that  you know  a couple of years ago  right around the time of the first immigration debate  i attended a naturalization workshop at a church in chicago  i walked down the aisle of the church and met people who were clutching their american flags  waiting to be called up so they could start the long process of becoming citizens  at one point  a little girl came up to me and asked me for my autograph  she said her name was cristina  that she was studying government  and wanted to show the autograph to her third grade class  i told her parents they should be proud of her  and as i watched cristina translate my words into spanish for them  i thought for a moment about dr  king's telegram to cesar chavez  and i knew that  in the end  our separate dreams are really one as well  it's the dream my father had when he arrived here from kenya  the dream cristina's parents had for her  and the dream that i have for my own two daughters  i chose a career in public service almost twenty five years ago because each night that i tuck them in  i realize that their chances in life depend on our ability to create a country where what they look like and where they come from has no bearing on what they can become  that's what has guided my life's work  and if you give me the chance  that's exactly the kind of country i will work for as your president  i ask you to give me that chance  thank you "], ["obama1", "i want to start by thanking your president  lauren wolfe  for the leadership you bring to this organization and to students all across america  i'd also like to thank your vice president  awais khaleel  and your executive director  latoia jones  i'd like to give a special shout out to two other college democrat leaders who i am lucky enough to have working on my campaign   bess evans is an organizer for us in iowa and ashley baia is organizing for us right here in south carolina  and i'd like to especially thank the couple hundred of you who have joined my college democrats steering committee  this is an unprecedented show of support and we're very grateful to have it  but mostly i want to thank every student here for the work you're doing all across the country  you are organizing campuses  you are registering new voters  and you are breathing new life into a politics that has never needed it more  and for that you should all be very proud  each of you has made the decision to come here and get involved for a reason  maybe you want to make sure the college education you're receiving will lead to a good job that can pay off all those loans  maybe you're tired of watching our planet polluted and our climate changed forever because you know that you and your children will be the ones dealing with it  maybe you've traveled abroad and heard people belittle america  and maybe you felt angry because you know we're a better country than this   you know we're not a country that tortures people or locks them away without ever telling them why  you know we're not a country that alienates our allies and rejects diplomacy with our enemies  we're better than that  or maybe you're here because you had to say goodbye to a friend or a classmate when they left to fight this war in iraq  you know how brave they are  and you know they've done everything that's been asked of them  but you also know one other thing   you know that this is a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged  and it's time for that friend to come home  but no matter what the reason is that brought you here  you came because you believe that we can change all this  you believe what was said about this country in the earliest days of our revolution   that we have it within our power to begin the world anew  i want you to know that's why i'm here too  that's what i have believed all my life  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  i know it's not an easy proposition to believe  especially today  not when our politics is more concerned with who's up and who's down than who's working to solve the challenges facing our generation  not when our politicians allow the oil companies to control our energy policy  and the insurance companies to control our health care policy  and whoever's got the most money and influence to control the agenda in washington  and not when we've got a  hour news cycle that never fails to keep us posted on how many days paris hilton will spend in jail but doesn't always cover the continuing genocide in darfur or the recovery effort in new orleans or the poverty that plagues too many american streets  you see all this and it's easy to become cynical   to believe these same pundits when they say that the youth vote doesn't really matter  that college students don't register to vote and when they do  they never go to the polls anyway  and so it's easy to just stay home and give in to the proposition that one person really can't make a difference after all  don't believe it  if there's one thing i've learned in my own life  it's that when you stop listening to the cynics and start trying to make that difference  extraordinary things can happen  a few years after i graduated from college i had this crazy idea that i wanted to be a community organizer  my friends had all applied for jobs on wall street and my mother and grandparents thought i should go to law school  but i went ahead and wrote letters to every organization in the country that i could think of  and finally  this small group of churches on the south side of chicago wrote back and gave me a job for   a year helping to turn around neighborhoods that had been devastated by steel plant closings  and i can still remember the conversation i had with an older man i had met before i moved to chicago  i told him about my plans  and he looked at me and said   let me tell something  you look like a nice clean cut young man  and you've got a nice voice  so let me give you a piece of advice   forget this community organizing business  you can't change the world  and people won't appreciate you trying  what you should do is go into television broadcasting  i'm telling you  you've got a future  now  no offense to my friends with the microphones in the back of the room  but boy am i glad i didn't listen to that old man  i kept going to chicago  and when i got there and saw the joblessness and hopelessness that existed in those neighborhoods  i knew my job wouldn't be easy  but i worked hard to build coalitions with all kinds of community leaders  and we kept working  and we set up child care and job training programs  and we taught people to stand up to their government when it wasn't standing up for them  we didn't change the world  but we changed those neighborhoods  and i proved that old man wrong  and i've done the same thing ever since  when i got to the illinois state senate  people said it was too tough to take on the issue of money in politics   that i couldn't do anything about a law that actually allowed politicians to pocket the money in their campaign accounts for personal use  but i brought people together  and i found a few folks on the other side of the aisle who were willing to listen  and we passed the first major ethics reform in twenty five years  people told me i couldn't reform a death penalty system that had sent   innocent people to death row  but we did that  they told me that trying to pass laws to stop racial profiling would stir up too much controversy  but we did that too  they doubted whether we could put government back on the side of average people   but we put tax cuts in the pockets of the working families who needed them instead of the folks who didn't  and i passed health care reform that insured another   children and parents  so i want you to know that i've been where you are  i looked at the world as a young man and i wanted to make a difference  and i was often told that change wasn't possible  but i learned that it was  i believe that it still is  and i'm ready to join you in changing the course that we're on by bringing a new generation of leadership to the united states of america  the reason this president has failed to lead our country is because he has not been able to unite our country  he has polarized us when he could've pulled us together  he has put what's right for his friends and supporters ahead of what's right for america  that's why the experience we need in the next president is the ability to bring this country together  to find common ground so we can meet common challenges  that's the kind of experience i will bring to the white house  i know it's not enough to just change parties or even presidents  i know that to truly change the way washington works  we need to build a movement of everyday americans who are committed to that change long after the last ballot is counted  and that's what we're doing in this campaign  we've had more people sign up and contribute than any other campaign in history  we've had countless people show up at our events who are coming to the first political event of their lifetime  they are young and old  rich and poor  gay and straight  black  white  latino  and asian  these americans are saying it's time for a change  it's time to turn the page  it's time for a new generation of leadership in washington  it's time for a new generation of leadership to solve this health care crisis once and for all  it's time to move past the failed debates of yesterday  bring everyone to the table  and finally let the drug and insurance companies know that while they get a seat at that table  the don't get to buy every chair  i have a universal health care plan that will cover every american and cut the cost of a typical family's premiums by up to   a year  it's a plan that lets the uninsured buy insurance that's similar to the kind members of congress give themselves  if you can't afford that  you'll get a subsidy to pay for it  and here's something we included after hearing about it from young people across the country   if you graduate and don't find a job that provides health insurance right away  you'll be able to stay on your parents' insurance until you're twenty five  i can't promise they'll let you live at home for that long  but i can promise you this   i will sign this universal health care bill by the end of my first term in office as your president  it's time to get that done  it's time for a new generation of leadership to make college more affordable for any american who wants to go  it's time to tell all those private lenders and banks that we're not going to give them eight billion in taxpayer dollars every year so that they can bribe colleges to get business giving students loans at inflated prices  we're not going to make college an unaffordable opportunity or saddle our students with a lifetime of debt  it's time to end those high priced loans and use the savings to help more kids afford a college education  and it's time we had a president who fights for that proposal instead of threatening to veto it  the very first bill i introduced when i got to the u s  senate was a bill to make college more affordable and provide more grants to students  that's the kind of leadership we need  it's time for a new generation of leadership to save our generation from global catastrophe  it's time to tell the auto and oil industry lobbyists that they don't get to stand in the way of higher fuel standards  and renewable sources of energy  and lower carbon emissions anymore  it's time to let them know that our economy  our security  and our planet come before their profits  as president  i will place a cap on carbon emissions  and require companies who can't meet the cap to buy credits from those who can  this will generate millions of dollars to invest in renewable sources of energy and create new jobs and even a new industry in the process  i'll put in place a low carbon fuel standard that will take   million cars' worth of pollution off the road  and i'd raise the fuel efficiency standards for our cars and trucks because we know we have the technology to do it and it's time we did  and one more thing  it is time for a new generation of leadership to end this war in iraq and restore american leadership in the world  i opposed this war back in   when i was running for the united states senate  and people told me that position might cost me the election  but i believed then that being a leader means that you do what's right and leave the politics aside because you don't get a do over on an issue as important as war  i introduced a plan in january that would've already started bringing our troops home by now  with the goal of bringing all combat brigades home by march  st    george bush vetoed a bipartisan plan just like that   but he doesn't get the last word here  we are fifteen votes away in the senate from ending this war without him  so we need to keep turning up the pressure on all those republican congressmen and senators who aren't voting the right way  and i'm asking you all to help me with this  you can help bring this war to an end  some of these senators are already changing their mind  so i need you to call them up  and write them  and tell them that if they don't switch their votes on iraq  you'll be switching your votes next november  it's time to start getting our troops out of iraq so we can start focusing on the growing threat from al qaeda   because we can't win a war against the terrorists if we're on the wrong battlefield  it's time to turn the page on the era of bush cheney diplomacy and reach out to the rest of the world again  refusing to engage in tough  smart diplomacy with world leaders we don't like doesn't show your strength  it shows your stubbornness  and we don't need another eight years of that  whether it's terrorism or climate change  global aids or the spread of weapons of mass destruction  america cannot meet the threats of this new century alone  but the world cannot meet them without america  it's time for america to show the world that we're still the last  best hope of earth  it's time for america to lead again  and we need a new generation of leadership to make that happen  that's where you come in  this country needs you  as someone who is ready to serve as your next president  i need you  we need your energy  your enthusiasm  and your commitment to this movement for change  we need you to get involved  and join or start up a students for obama chapter of your own  and i'd like to especially ask each of you to go back to your college campuses and register ten  or fifteen  or fifty new voters  i led a voter registration drive when i wasn't much older than you and we registered   new voters when no one thought it was possible  so let's prove the cynics wrong again  let's show them you do make a difference   that your vote does count   that america better start listening to the next generation of americans  this is our moment to make a difference  throughout america's story  there have been some generations that just fade into history  and others that have changed the course of that history forever  in the face of secession and slavery  a generation answered their president's call to the better angels of our nature by saving a union and freeing a people  in the face of depression and fascism  a generation answered a leader who said that fear itself was the only thing standing our way by conquering that fear  lifting our nation from despair  and liberating a continent  in the face of inequality and injustice  a generation answered a king's dream of brotherhood by taking freedom rides  and sitting at lunch counters  and marching in the streets until justice rolled down like water  and righteousness like a mighty stream  and now  in this election  it is our generation's turn to answer this call  it is our turn to write a new chapter in the america story  let's write that next chapter  let's turn that next page  let's bring a new generation of leadership to america  and let's change this country together  thank you   em as prepared for delivery em "], ["obama1", "thank you lee  for hosting me here at the wilson center  and for your leadership of both the   commission and the iraq study group  you have been a steady voice of reason in an unsteady time let me also say that my thoughts and prayers are with your colleague  haleh esfandiari  and her family  i have made my position known to the iranian government  it is time for haleh to be released  it is time for haleh to come home  thanks to the   commission  we know that six years ago this week president bush received a briefing with the headline   bin ladin determined to strike in u s  it came during what the commission called the  summer of threat  when the  system was blinking red  about an impending attack  but despite the briefing  many felt the danger was overseas  a threat to embassies and military installations  the extremism  the resentment  the terrorist training camps  and the killers were in the dark corners of the world  far away from the american homeland  then  one bright and beautiful tuesday morning  they were here  i was driving to a state legislative hearing in downtown chicago when i heard the news on my car radio  a plane had hit the world trade center  by the time i got to my meeting  the second plane had hit  and we were told to evacuate  people gathered in the streets and looked up at the sky and the sears tower  transformed from a workplace to a target  we feared for our families and our country  we mourned the terrible loss suffered by our fellow citizens  back at my law office  i watched the images from new york  a plane vanishing into glass and steel  men and women clinging to windowsills  then letting go  tall towers crumbling to dust  it seemed all of the misery and all of the evil in the world were in that rolling black cloud  blocking out the september sun  what we saw that morning forced us to recognize that in a new world of threats  we are no longer protected by our own power  and what we saw that morning was a challenge to a new generation  the history of america is one of tragedy turned into triumph  and so a war over secession became an opportunity to set the captives free  an attack on pearl harbor led to a wave of freedom rolling across the atlantic and pacific  an iron curtain was punctured by democratic values  new institutions at home  and strong international partnerships abroad after   our calling was to write a new chapter in the american story  to devise new strategies and build new alliances  to secure our homeland and safeguard our values  and to serve a just cause abroad  we were ready  americans were united  friends around the world stood shoulder to shoulder with us  we had the might and moral suasion that was the legacy of generations of americans  the tide of history seemed poised to turn  once again  toward hope  but then everything changed  we did not finish the job against al qaeda in afghanistan  we did not develop new capabilities to defeat a new enemy  or launch a comprehensive strategy to dry up the terrorists' base of support  we did not reaffirm our basic values  or secure our homeland  instead  we got a color coded politics of fear  patriotism as the possession of one political party  the diplomacy of refusing to talk to other countries  a rigid  th century ideology that insisted that the  st century's stateless terrorism could be defeated through the invasion and occupation of a state  a deliberate strategy to misrepresent   to sell a war against a country that had nothing to do with  and so  a little more than a year after that bright september day  i was in the streets of chicago again  this time speaking at a rally in opposition to war in iraq  i did not oppose all wars  i said  i was a strong supporter of the war in afghanistan  but i said i could not support  a dumb war  a rash war  in iraq  i worried about a   u s  occupation of undetermined length  at undetermined cost  with undetermined consequences  in the heart of the muslim world  i pleaded that we  finish the fight with bin ladin and al qaeda the political winds were blowing in a different direction  the president was determined to go to war  there was just one obstacle  the u s  congress  nine days after i spoke  that obstacle was removed  congress rubber stamped the rush to war  giving the president the broad and open ended authority he uses to this day  with that vote  congress became co author of a catastrophic war  and we went off to fight on the wrong battlefield  with no appreciation of how many enemies we would create  and no plan for how to get out  because of a war in iraq that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged  we are now less safe than we were before   according to the national intelligence estimate  the threat to our homeland from al qaeda is  persistent and evolving  iraq is a training ground for terror  torn apart by civil war  afghanistan is more violent than it has been since   al qaeda has a sanctuary in pakistan  israel is besieged by emboldened enemies  talking openly of its destruction  iran is now presenting the broadest strategic challenge to the united states in the middle east in a generation  groups affiliated with or inspired by al qaeda operate worldwide  six years after   we are again in the midst of a  summer of threat  with bin ladin and many more terrorists determined to strike in the united states  what's more  in the dark halls of abu ghraib and the detention cells of guantanamo  we have compromised our most precious values  what could have been a call to a generation has become an excuse for unchecked presidential power  a tragedy that united us was turned into a political wedge issue used to divide us  it is time to turn the page  it is time to write a new chapter in our response to   just because the president misrepresents our enemies does not mean we do not have them  the terrorists are at war with us  the threat is from violent extremists who are a small minority of the world's   billion muslims  but the threat is real  they distort islam  they kill man  woman and child  christian and hindu  jew and muslim  they seek to create a repressive caliphate  to defeat this enemy  we must understand who we are fighting against  and what we are fighting for  the president would have us believe that every bomb in baghdad is part of al qaeda's war against us  not an iraqi civil war  he elevates al qaeda in iraq   which didn't exist before our invasion   and overlooks the people who hit us on   who are training new recruits in pakistan  he lumps together groups with very different goals  al qaeda and iran  shiite militias and sunni insurgents  he confuses our mission  and worse   he is fighting the war the terrorists want us to fight  bin ladin and his allies know they cannot defeat us on the field of battle or in a genuine battle of ideas  but they can provoke the reaction we've seen in iraq  a misguided invasion of a muslim country that sparks new insurgencies  ties down our military  busts our budgets  increases the pool of terrorist recruits  alienates america  gives democracy a bad name  and prompts the american people to question our engagement in the world  by refusing to end the war in iraq  president bush is giving the terrorists what they really want  and what the congress voted to give them in   a u s  occupation of undetermined length  at undetermined cost  with undetermined consequences  it is time to turn the page  when i am president  we will wage the war that has to be won  with a comprehensive strategy with five elements  getting out of iraq and on to the right battlefield in afghanistan and pakistan  developing the capabilities and partnerships we need to take out the terrorists and the world's most deadly weapons  engaging the world to dry up support for terror and extremism  restoring our values  and securing a more resilient homeland  the first step must be getting off the wrong battlefield in iraq  and taking the fight to the terrorists in afghanistan and pakistan  i introduced a plan in january that would have already started bringing our troops out of iraq  with a goal of removing all combat brigades by march     if the president continues to veto this plan  then ending this war will be my first priority when i take office  there is no military solution in iraq  only iraq's leaders can settle the grievances at the heart of iraq's civil war  we must apply pressure on them to act  and our best leverage is reducing our troop presence  and we must also do the hard and sustained diplomatic work in the region on behalf of peace and stability  in ending the war  we must act with more wisdom than we started it  that is why my plan would maintain sufficient forces in the region to target al qaeda within iraq  but we must recognize that al qaeda is not the primary source of violence in iraq  and has little support   not from shia and kurds who al qaeda has targeted  or sunni tribes hostile to foreigners  on the contrary  al qaeda's appeal within iraq is enhanced by our troop presence  ending the war will help isolate al qaeda and give iraqis the incentive and opportunity to take them out  it will also allow us to direct badly needed resources to afghanistan  our troops have fought valiantly there  but iraq has deprived them of the support they need and deserve  as a result  parts of afghanistan are falling into the hands of the taliban  and a mix of terrorism  drugs  and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country  as president  i would deploy at least two additional brigades to afghanistan to re enforce our counter terrorism operations and support nato's efforts against the taliban  as we step up our commitment  our european friends must do the same  and without the burdensome restrictions that have hampered nato's efforts  we must also put more of an afghan face on security by improving the training and equipping of the afghan army and police  and including afghan soldiers in u s  and nato operations  we must not  however  repeat the mistakes of iraq  the solution in afghanistan is not just military   it is political and economic  as president  i would increase our non military aid by   billion  these resources should fund projects at the local level to impact ordinary afghans  including the development of alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers  and we must seek better performance from the afghan government  and support that performance through tough anti corruption safeguards on aid  and increased international support to develop the rule of law across the country  above all  i will send a clear message  we will not repeat the mistake of the past  when we turned our back on afghanistan following soviet withdrawal  as   showed us  the security of afghanistan and america is shared  and today  that security is most threatened by the al qaeda and taliban sanctuary in the tribal regions of northwest pakistan  al qaeda terrorists train  travel  and maintain global communications in this safe haven  the taliban pursues a hit and run strategy  striking in afghanistan  then skulking across the border to safety  this is the wild frontier of our globalized world  there are wind swept deserts and cave dotted mountains  there are tribes that see borders as nothing more than lines on a map  and governments as forces that come and go  there are blood ties deeper than alliances of convenience  and pockets of extremism that follow religion to violence  it's a tough place  but that is no excuse  there must be no safe haven for terrorists who threaten america  we cannot fail to act because action is hard  as president  i would make the hundreds of millions of dollars in u s  military aid to pakistan conditional  and i would make our conditions clear  pakistan must make substantial progress in closing down the training camps  evicting foreign fighters  and preventing the taliban from using pakistan as a staging area for attacks in afghanistan  i understand that president musharraf has his own challenges  but let me make this clear  there are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered   americans  they are plotting to strike again  it was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al qaeda leadership meeting in   if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and president musharraf won't act  we will  and pakistan needs more than f s to combat extremism  as the pakistani government increases investment in secular education to counter radical madrasas  my administration will increase america's commitment  we must help pakistan invest in the provinces along the afghan border  so that the extremists' program of hate is met with one of hope  and we must not turn a blind eye to elections that are neither free nor fair   our goal is not simply an ally in pakistan  it is a democratic ally  beyond pakistan  there is a core of terrorists   probably in the tens of thousands   who have made their choice to attack america  so the second step in my strategy will be to build our capacity and our partnerships to track down  capture or kill terrorists around the world  and to deny them the world's most dangerous weapons i will not hesitate to use military force to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to america  this requires a broader set of capabilities  as outlined in the army and marine corps's new counter insurgency manual  i will ensure that our military becomes more stealth  agile  and lethal in its ability to capture or kill terrorists  we need to recruit  train  and equip our armed forces to better target terrorists  and to help foreign militaries to do the same  this must include a program to bolster our ability to speak different languages  understand different cultures  and coordinate complex missions with our civilian agencies  to succeed  we must improve our civilian capacity  the finest military in the world is adapting to the challenges of the  st century  but it cannot counter insurgent and terrorist threats without civilian counterparts who can carry out economic and political reconstruction missions   sometimes in dangerous places  as president  i will strengthen these civilian capacities  recruiting our best and brightest to take on this challenge  i will increase both the numbers and capabilities of our diplomats  development experts  and other civilians who can work alongside our military  we can't just say there is no military solution to these problems  we need to integrate all aspects of american might  one component of this integrated approach will be new mobile development teams that bring together personnel from the state department  the pentagon  and usaid  these teams will work with civil society and local governments to make an immediate impact in peoples' lives  and to turn the tide against extremism  where people are most vulnerable  where the light of hope has grown dark  and where we are in a position to make a real difference in advancing security and opportunity   that is where these teams will go  i will also strengthen our intelligence  this is about more than an organizational chart  we need leadership that forces our agencies to share information  and leadership that never   ever   twists the facts to support bad policies  but we must also build our capacity to better collect and analyze information  and to carry out operations to disrupt terrorist plots and break up terrorist networks  this cannot just be an american mission  al qaeda and its allies operate in nearly   countries  the united states cannot steal every secret  penetrate every cell  act on every tip  or track down every terrorist   nor should we have to do this alone  this is not just about our security  it is about the common security of all the world  as president  i will create a shared security partnership program to forge an international intelligence and law enforcement infrastructure to take down terrorist networks from the remote islands of indonesia  to the sprawling cities of africa  this program will provide   billion over three years for counter terrorism cooperation with countries around the world  including information sharing  funding for training  operations  border security  anti corruption programs  technology  and targeting terrorist financing  and this effort will focus on helping our partners succeed without repressive tactics  because brutality breeds terror  it does not defeat it  we must also do more to safeguard the world's most dangerous weapons  we know al qaeda seeks a nuclear weapon  we know they would not hesitate to use one  yet there is still about   tons of highly enriched uranium  some of it poorly secured  at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries  there are still about   to   nuclear weapons and stockpiles of uranium and plutonium scattered across   time zones in the former soviet union  that is why i worked in the senate with dick lugar to pass a law that would help the united states and our allies detect and stop the smuggling of weapons of mass destruction  that is why i am introducing a bill with chuck hagel that seeks to prevent nuclear terrorism  reduce global nuclear arsenals  and stop the spread of nuclear weapons  and that is why  as president  i will lead a global effort to secure all nuclear weapons and material at vulnerable sites within four years  while we work to secure existing stockpiles  we should also negotiate a verifiable global ban on the production of new nuclear weapons material  and i won't hesitate to use the power of american diplomacy to stop countries from obtaining these weapons or sponsoring terror  the lesson of the bush years is that not talking does not work  go down the list of countries we've ignored and see how successful that strategy has been  we haven't talked to iran  and they continue to build their nuclear program  we haven't talked to syria  and they continue support for terror  we tried not talking to north korea  and they now have enough material for   to   more nuclear weapons  it's time to turn the page on the diplomacy of tough talk and no action  it's time to turn the page on washington's conventional wisdom that agreement must be reached before you meet  that talking to other countries is some kind of reward  and that presidents can only meet with people who will tell them what they want to hear  president kennedy said it best   let us never negotiate out of fear  but let us never fear to negotiate  only by knowing your adversary can you defeat them or drive wedges between them  as president  i will work with our friend and allies  but i won't outsource our diplomacy in tehran to the europeans  or our diplomacy in pyongyang to the chinese  i will do the careful preparation needed  and let these countries know where america stands  they will no longer have the excuse of american intransigence  they will have our terms  no support for terror and no nuclear weapons  but america must be about more than taking out terrorists and locking up weapons  or else new terrorists will rise up to take the place of every one we capture or kill  that is why the third step in my strategy will be drying up the rising well of support for extremism when you travel to the world's trouble spots as a united states senator  much of what you see is from a helicopter  so you look out  with the buzz of the rotor in your ear  maybe a door gunner nearby  and you see the refugee camp in darfur  the flood near djibouti  the bombed out block in baghdad  you see thousands of desperate faces  al qaeda's new recruits come from africa and asia  the middle east and europe  many come from disaffected communities and disconnected corners of our interconnected world  and it makes you stop and wonder  when those faces look up at an american helicopter  do they feel hope  or do they feel hate  we know where extremists thrive  in conflict zones that are incubators of resentment and anarchy  in weak states that cannot control their borders or territory  or meet the basic needs of their people  from africa to central asia to the pacific rim   nearly   countries stand on the brink of conflict or collapse  the extremists encourage the exploitation of these hopeless places on their hate filled websites  and we know what the extremists say about us  america is just an occupying army in muslim lands  the shadow of a shrouded figure standing on a box at abu ghraib  the power behind the throne of a repressive leader  they say we are at war with islam  that is the whispered line of the extremist who has nothing to offer in this battle of ideas but blame   blame america  blame progress  blame jews  and often he offers something along with the hate  a sense of empowerment  maybe an education at a madrasa  some charity for your family  some basic services in the neighborhood  and then  a mission and a gun  we know we are not who they say we are  america is at war with terrorists who killed on our soil  we are not at war with islam  america is a compassionate nation that wants a better future for all people  the vast majority of the world's   billion muslims have no use for bin ladin or his bankrupt ideas  but too often since   the extremists have defined us  not the other way around  when i am president  that will change  we will author our own story  we do need to stand for democracy  and i will  but democracy is about more than a ballot box  america must show   through deeds as well as words   that we stand with those who seek a better life  that child looking up at the helicopter must see america and feel hope  as president  i will make it a focus of my foreign policy to roll back the tide of hopelessness that gives rise to hate  freedom must mean freedom from fear  not the freedom of anarchy  i will never shrug my shoulders and say   as secretary rumsfeld did    freedom is untidy  i will focus our support on helping nations build independent judicial systems  honest police forces  and financial systems that are transparent and accountable  freedom must also mean freedom from want  not freedom lost to an empty stomach  so i will make poverty reduction a key part of helping other nations reduce anarchy  i will double our annual investments to meet these challenges to   billion by   and i will support a   billion global education fund to counter the radical madrasas   often funded by money from within saudi arabia   that have filled young minds with messages of hate  we must work for a world where every child  everywhere  is taught to build and not to destroy  and as we lead we will ask for more from our friends in europe and asia as well   more support for our diplomacy  more support for multilateral peacekeeping  and more support to rebuild societies ravaged by conflict  i will also launch a program of public diplomacy that is a coordinated effort across my administration  not a small group of political officials at the state department explaining a misguided war  we will open  america houses  in cities across the islamic world  with internet  libraries  english lessons  stories of america's muslims and the strength they add to our country  and vocational programs  through a new   america's voice corps  we will recruit  train  and send out into the field talented young americans who can speak with   and listen to   the people who today hear about us only from our enemies as president  i will lead this effort  in the first   days of my administration  i will travel to a major islamic forum and deliver an address to redefine our struggle  i will make clear that we are not at war with islam  that we will stand with those who are willing to stand up for their future  and that we need their effort to defeat the prophets of hate and violence  i will speak directly to that child who looks up at that helicopter  and my message will be clear   you matter to us  your future is our future  and our moment is now  this brings me to the fourth step in my strategy  i will make clear that the days of compromising our values are over  major general paul eaton had a long and distinguished career serving this country  it included training the iraqi army  after abu ghraib  his senior iraqi advisor came into his office and said   you have no idea how this will play out on the streets of baghdad and the rest of the arab world  how can this be  this was not the america he had looked up to  as the counter insurgency manual reminds us  we cannot win a war unless we maintain the high ground and keep the people on our side  but because the administration decided to take the low road  our troops have more enemies  because the administration cast aside international norms that reflect american values  we are less able to promote our values  when i am president  america will reject torture without exception  america is the country that stood against that kind of behavior  and we will do so again i also will reject a legal framework that does not work  there has been only one conviction at guantanamo  it was for a guilty plea on material support for terrorism  the sentence was   months  there has not been one conviction of a terrorist act  i have faith in america's courts  and i have faith in our jags  as president  i will close guantanamo  reject the military commissions act  and adhere to the geneva conventions  our constitution and our uniform code of military justice provide a framework for dealing with the terrorists  this administration also puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand  i will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our constitution and our freedom  that means no more illegal wire tapping of american citizens  no more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime  no more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war  no more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient  that is not who we are  and it is not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists  the fisa court works  the separation of powers works  our constitution works  we will again set an example for the world that the law is not subject to the whims of stubborn rulers  and that justice is not arbitrary  this administration acts like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance our security  it is not  there are no short cuts to protecting america  and that is why the fifth part of my strategy is doing the hard and patient work to secure a more resilient homeland  too often this administration's approach to homeland security has been to scatter money around and avoid hard choices  or to scare americans without telling them what to be scared of  or what to do  a department set up to make americans feel safer didn't even show up when bodies drifted through the streets in new orleans  that's not acceptable  my administration will take an approach to homeland security guided by risk  i will establish a quadrennial review at the department of homeland security   just like at the pentagon   to undertake a top to bottom review of the threats we face and our ability to confront them  and i will develop a comprehensive national infrastructure protection plan that draws on both local know how and national priorities  we have to put resources where our infrastructure is most vulnerable  that means tough and permanent standards for securing our chemical plants  improving our capability to screen cargo and investing in safeguards that will prevent the disruption of our ports  and making sure our energy sector   our refineries and pipelines and power grids   is protected so that terrorists cannot cripple our economy  we also have to get past a top down approach  folks across america are the ones on the front lines  on   it was citizens   empowered by their knowledge of the world trade center attacks   who protected our government by heroically taking action on flight   to keep it from reaching our nation's capital  when i have information that can empower americans  i will share it with them  information sharing with state and local governments must be a two way street  because we never know where the two pieces of the puzzle are that might fit together   the tip from afghanistan  and the cop who sees something suspicious on michigan avenue  i will increase funding to help train police to gather information and connect it to the intelligence they receive from the federal government  i will address the problem in our prisons  where the most disaffected and disconnected americans are being explicitly targeted for conversion by al qaeda and its ideological allies  and my administration will not permit more lives to be lost because emergency responders are not outfitted with the communications capability and protective equipment their job requires  or because the federal government is too slow to respond when disaster strikes  we've been through that on   we've been through it during katrina  i will ensure that we have the resources and competent federal leadership we need to support our communities when american lives are at stake  but this effort can't just be about what we ask of our men and women in uniform  it can't just be about how we spend our time or our money  it's about the kind of country we are we are in the early stages of a long struggle  yet since   we've heard a lot about what america can't do or shouldn't do or won't even try  we can't vote against a misguided war in iraq because that would make us look weak  or talk to other countries because that would be a reward  we can't reach out to the hundreds of millions of muslims who reject terror because we worry they hate us  we can't protect the homeland because there are too many targets  or secure our people while staying true to our values  we can't get past the america of red and blue  the politics of who's up and who's down  that is not the america that i know  the america i know is the last  best hope for that child looking up at a helicopter  it's the country that put a man on the moon  that defeated fascism and helped rebuild europe  it's a country whose strength abroad is measured not just by armies  but rather by the power of our ideals  and by our purpose to forge an ever more perfect union at home  that's the america i know  we just have to act like it again to write that next chapter in the american story  if we do  we can keep america safe while extending security and opportunity around the world  we can hold true to our values  and in doing so advance those values abroad  and we can be what that child looking up at a helicopter needs us to be  the relentless opponent of terror and tyranny  and the light of hope to the world  to make this story reality  it's going to take americans coming together and changing the fundamental direction of this country  it's going to take the service of a new generation of young people  it's going to take facing tragedy head on and turning it into the next generation's triumph  that is a challenge that i welcome  because when we do make that change  we'll do more than win a war   we'll live up to that calling to make america  and the world  safer  freer  and more hopeful than we found it em as prepared for delivery em "], ["obama1", "thank you  commander kurpius  for that introduction and for your leadership  and let me acknowledge the incoming national commander george lisicki  i want to thank all of the members of the veterans of foreign wars of the united states of america for inviting me here today  i'm glad to see rich coombe  the state commander for illinois  and let me say a word of acknowledgment to the   illinoisans who are vfw members  to america's veterans  our country must speak with one voice  we honor your service  and we enter into a sacred trust with you from the moment you put on that uniform  that trust is simple  america will be there for you just as you have been there for america  as a candidate for the presidency  i know that i am running to become commander in chief   to safeguard this nation's security  and to keep that sacred trust  there is no responsibility that i take more seriously  we know that the america we live in is the legacy of those who have borne the burden of battle  you are part of an unbroken line ofamericans who threw off the tyranny of a king  who held the country together and set the captives free  who faced down fascism and fought for freedom in korea and vietnam  who liberated kuwait and stopped ethnic cleansing in the balkans  and who fight bravely and brilliantly under our flag today in iraq and afghanistan  keeping faith with those who serve must always be a core american value and a cornerstone of american patriotism  because america's commitment to its servicemen and women begins at enlistment  and it must never end  without that commitment  i probably wouldn't be here today  my grandfather   stanley dunham   enlisted after pearl harbor and went on to march in patton's army  my mother was born at fort leavenworth and my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line  after my grandfather stood up for his country  america stood by him  he went to college on the gi bill  bought his first home with help from the federal housing authority  then he moved his family west to hawaii  where i was born  and where he and my grandmother helped raise me  he is buried in the punchbowl  the national memorial cemetery of the pacific  where   victims of pearl harbor are laid to rest  i knew him when he was older  but i think about him now and then as he enlisted   a man of   fresh faced with a wise guy grin   when i see young men and women signing up to serve today  these sons and daughters of america are the best and bravest among us  and they are signing up at a time when the dangers that america faces are great  since the end of the cold war  threats from distant corners of the world increasingly pose a direct danger to america  killing fields in rwanda  congo and darfur have offended our common humanity and set back the world's sense of collective security  weak and failing states from africa to central asia to the pacific rim are incubators of resentment and anarchy that can endanger those countries and ours  an assertive russia and a rising china remind us   through words and deeds   that the primacy of our power does not mean our power will go unchallenged  a new age of nuclear proliferation has left the world's most deadly weapons unlocked by more and more countries  with thousands of weapons and stockpiles poorly secured all over the world  at the dawn of the  st century  the threats we face can no longer be contained by borders and boundaries  that is the lesson of   we will never forget the   americans killed on     more than we lost at pearl harbor  the threat did not come from a dictator  a state  or an empire   it came from stateless terrorists  these violent extremists are a small minority in the muslim world  they distort islam  they hate america  they kill man  woman and child  and they seek a repressive caliphate that would resemble afghanistan under the taliban  our brave young men and women have signed up to make these burdens their own  they have come face to face with the threats of the  st century  and they have been asked to bear an evolving and ever increasing load  peacekeeping missions  intelligence gathering  training foreign militaries  earthquake and tsunami relief  fighting with afghan allies to topple the taliban  persevering in the deserts and cities of iraq  the u s  military has answered when called  and the verdict on their performance is clear  through their commitment  their courage  and their capability they have done us all proud  what we need is civilian leadership that lives up this service  we had a chance to deliver a decisive blow to the taliban and al qaeda and to bring this country together with unity of effort and purpose  instead  we went to war in iraq   a war that i opposed   with no plan for how to win the peace  shifting our focus  straining our military  splitting our country  and sacrificing our global standing  i want to be clear  our troops have performed brilliantly in iraq  they have done everything we have asked of them  they have won every battle they have fought  they have built schools and trained battalions  i know there are honest differences about the next steps that we should take  and the truth is   there are no good options  all of our top military commanders recognize that there is no military solution in iraq  and no matter how brilliantly and bravely our troops and their commanders perform  they cannot and should not bear the responsibility of resolving grievances at the heart of iraq's civil war  no military surge can succeed without political reconciliation and a surge of diplomacy in iraq and the region  iraq's leaders are not reconciling  they are not achieving political benchmarks  the only thing they seem to have agreed on is to take a vacation  that is why i have pushed for a careful and responsible redeployment of troops engaged in combat operations out of iraq  joined with direct and sustained diplomacy in the region  and that is why i will continue to push the president to change our policy  one reason to stop fighting the wrong war is so that we can fight the right war against terrorism and extremism  and my judgment   based in part on the clear findings of the national intelligence estimate   is that the most direct terrorist threat to our homeland comes from al qaeda operating in afghanistan and pakistan  that's why earlier this month  i laid out a comprehensive counter terrorism strategy  that plan has five elements  first  we need to end the war in iraq and focus on the terrorists in afghanistan and pakistan  and i would re enforce our mission in afghanistan with at least two brigades  second  we need to develop our capabilities to take down terrorist networks and secure nuclear weapons  third  we need to dry up support for extremism  because we cannot win the long war unless we win more hearts and minds in the muslim world  fourth  we need to restore our values  because as the counter insurgency manual reminds us  torture sets back our mission to keep the people on our side  and fifth  we need to protect our homeland by setting common sense priorities  in laying out this strategy  i am guided by the understanding that there is no more awesome responsibility that is placed in a president's hand than protecting our country and our security  i believe that this strategy is one that we must pursue  guided by the principle that we must act swiftly and strongly against clear and imminent threats to our security  i will act with proper regard for the costs and consequences of action  based on the advice of military commanders and with a clear statement of purpose and policy to the american people  because a president can choose to go to war  but the country must be prepared to sustain it  that depends upon knowing why we are fighting  what clear goal we are fighting for  and how we plan to win the peace  and as we implement this comprehensive strategy  and phase out of iraq and bolster our mission in afghanistan  i believe we can then focus on rebuilding our military and taking better care of our servicemen and women  in an obama administration  i will ensure that america goes to war with the armed forces it needs  our troops should not be over stretched  we need to ensure that our ability to respond to threats around the world is never compromised  and i will always respect   and not ignore   the advice of military commanders  but i will also make clear that when i am president  the buck will stop in the oval office  we know our troops will answer the call  but we must issue that call responsibly  the wars in iraq and afghanistan have been marked by repeated and unpredictable deployments  aircraft bound for home have been turned around  soldiers and marines have served two  three or four tours  retention rates of west point graduates are approaching records lows  we need to keep these battle hardened majors and captains so they can become tomorrow's generals  we need predictable rotations  we need to deploy troops at an appropriate state of readiness  i will add   soldiers and   marines to relieve the strain on our ground forces  i will maintain our technological edge and invest in the capabilities we need to succeed in the missions of the  st century  that means training for critical languages like arabic  for civil affairs  and for increased special forces  and i will heed the call for greater civilian capacity  our troops  trained for war  are serving as water and electricity experts in baghdad and agricultural advisors in kandahar  the finest military in the world needs civilian partners who can carry out critical missions  we need to strengthen and integrate all aspects of american might  and this is not just about programs and policies  it's about people  part of our sacred trust with the men and women who serve is also providing the equipment they need  we've had troops deploying to iraq who had to buy life saving equipment on line  that's not america  that's not who we are  as president  i will ensure that every service member has what they need to do the job safely and successfully  and the strain of service is great in a place where a threat can come from a pile by the side of the road  a seemingly friendly face in the crowd  or a mortar lobbed into a base  just the other day we learned there were at least   suicides in the army last year   the most in a quarter century  to keep our sacred trust  i will improve mental health screening and treatment at all levels  from enlistment  to deployment  to reentry into civilian life  no service member should be kicked out of the military because they are struggling with untreated ptsd  no veteran should have to fill out a  page claim to get care  or wait months   even years   to get an appointment at the va  we need more mental health professionals  more training to recognize signs and to reject the stigma of seeking care  and to treat a signature wound of these wars  we need clear standards of care for traumatic brain injury  we also need to provide more services to our military families  let me thank the vfw for helping families with everything from repairs and errands to calling cards that bring a loved one nearer  efforts like operation uplink make a huge difference  you are filling in some of the painful spaces in peoples' lives  and anyone who has visited our military hospitals has seen wonderful spouses who don't see visiting hours as part time  that's why i passed a bill to provide family members with a year of job protection  so they never have to face a choice between caring for a loved one and keeping a job  i have also fought to improve shameful care for wounded warriors  i led a bipartisan effort to improve outpatient facilities  slash red tape  and reform the disability review process   because recovering troops should always go to the front of the line  and they shouldn't have to fight to get there  but we know that the sacred trust cannot expire when the uniform comes off  when we fail to keep faith with our veterans  the bond between our nation and our nation's heroes becomes frayed  when a veteran is denied care  we are all dishonored  it's not enough to lay a wreath on memorial day  or to pay tribute to our veterans in speeches  a proud and grateful nation owes more than ceremonial gestures and kind words  caring for those who serve   and for their families   is a fundamental responsibility of the commander in chief  it is not a separate cost  it is a cost of war  it is something i've fought for as a member of the senate committee on veterans' affairs  and it is something i will fight for as president of the united states  it's time for comprehensive reform  when i am president  building a  st century va to serve our veterans will be an equal priority to building a  st century military to fight our wars  my secretary of veteran's affairs will be just as important as my secretary of defense  no more shortfalls   it's time to fully fund the va medical center  no more delays   it's time to pass on time va budgets each and every year  no more means testing   it's time to allow all veterans back into the va  i will immediately reverse a policy that led the va to turn away nearly   million middle and low income veterans since   the va will also be at the cutting edge of my plan for universal health care  with better preventive care  more research and specialty treatment  and more vet centers  particularly in rural areas  i will revamp an overburdened benefits system  the vfw has done a remarkable job helping more than   veterans a year navigate the broken vba bureaucracy  but you shouldn't have to do it alone  i will hire additional workers  and create an electronic system that is fully linked up to military records and the va's health network  one of the most admired principles of the u s  military is that no one gets left behind  yet too often america does not keep faith with this principle  on any given night  more than   veterans are homeless  we're already hearing about hundreds of homeless iraq war vets  that's not right  that's not keeping our sacred trust  we must not leave these men and women behind  my principle will be simple  zero tolerance  zero tolerance for veterans sleeping on the streets  i've fought for this in the senate  and as president i'll expand housing vouchers  and i'll launch a new supportive services housing program to prevent at risk veterans and their families from sliding into homelessness  i'll also keep faith with america's veterans by helping them achieve their dreams  we need a g i  bill for the  st century  an obama administration will expand access to education for our veterans  and increase benefits to keep pace with rising costs  all who wear the uniform of the united states are entitled to the same opportunity that my grandfather had under the g i  bill  and our sacred trust does not end when a service member dies  the graves of our veterans are hallowed ground  when men and women who die in service to this country are laid to rest  there must be no protests near the funerals  it's wrong and it needs to stop    over   years ago  a handful of veterans from the spanish american war came together in places like a tailor shop in columbus  ohio  at the time  america had no medical care  no pensions for its returning warriors  folks could raise their voice  but washington didn't listen  so these men banded together and started a movement  they cared for each other and made the case for their rights  they founded local organizations all across this country  in   there were   members  today  you have nearly   million members  the veterans of foreign wars represents the best of america   the courage to fight for our country abroad  and coming together at home for a cause  oliver wendell holmes once remarked that  to fight out a war  you must believe something and want something with all your might  the americans who fight today believe in this country deeply  and no matter how many you meet  or how many stories of heroism you hear  every encounter reminds you that they are truly special  that through their service  they are living out the ideals that stir so many of us as americans   pride  duty  and sacrifice  some of the most inspiring are those you meet at places like walter reed medical center  young men and women who may have lost a limb or even their ability to take care of themselves  but will never lose the pride they feel for serving their country  they're not interested in self pity  but yearn to move forward with their lives  and it's this classically american optimism that makes you realize the quality of person we have serving in the united states armed forces  i know all of us don't agree on everything  i have heard those of you who disagree with me  i want you to know that i respect the views of all who come to this hall today  i will listen to them as a candidate  and i will listen to them as president  and i will be clear that whatever disagreements we have on policy  there will be no daylight between us when it comes to honoring these men and women who serve  and keeping faith with our veterans  this is not a partisan issue  this is a moral obligation  this must be a beachhead for bringing our country together  some like to say this country is divided  but that is not how i choose to see it  i see a country that all of us love   a country that my grandfather served  and that my father crossed an ocean to reach  i see values that all of us share   values of liberty  equality  and service to a common good and a greater good  i see a flag that we fly with pride  i see an america that is the strongest nation in the history of the world   not just because of our arms  but because of the strength of our values  and of the men and women who serve  as president franklin roosevelt said in his final inaugural   the almighty god has blessed our land in many ways  he has given our people stout hearts and strong arms with which to strike mighty blows for freedom and truth  he has given to our country a faith which has become the hope of all peoples in an anguished world  with that strength comes great responsibility   to join our strength with wisdom  and to keep that light of hope burning as a beacon to the world  and there is no responsibility greater than keeping faith with the men and women who serve  so that our country serves them as well as you have served us  let that be our calling  and let history find us never wanting   em as prepared for delivery em "], ["obama1", "a few months ago  i met a woman who told me her nephew was leaving for iraq  as she started to tell me about how much she'd miss him and how worried she was about him  she began to cry   i can't breathe ' she said   i want to know when i am going to be able to breathe again ' i have her on my mind when i think about what we've gone through as a country and where we need to go  because we've been holding our breath over iraq for five years  as we go through yet another debate about yet another phase of this misguided war  we've got a familiar feeling  again  we're told that progress is upon us  again  we're asked to hold our breath a little longer  again  we're reminded of what's gone wrong with our policies and our politics  it was five years ago today   on september       that president bush made his case for war at the united nations  standing in front of a world that stood with us after   he said   in the attacks on america a year ago  we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies ' then he talked about saddam hussein   a man who had nothing to do with   but citing the lesson of   he and others said we had to act   to suggest otherwise ' the president said   is to hope against the evidence ' george bush was wrong  the people who attacked us on   were in afghanistan  not iraq  al qaeda in iraq didn't exist before our invasion  the case for war was built on exaggerated fears and empty evidence   so much so that bob graham  the chairman of the senate intelligence committee  decided to vote against the war after he read the national intelligence estimate  but conventional thinking in washington lined up for war  the pundits judged the political winds to be blowing in the direction of the president  despite   or perhaps because of how much experience they had in washington  too many politicians feared looking weak and failed to ask hard questions  too many took the president at his word instead of reading the intelligence for themselves  congress gave the president the authority to go to war  our only opportunity to stop the war was lost  i made a different judgment  i thought our priority had to be finishing the fight in afghanistan  i spoke out against what i called  a rash war' in iraq  i worried about   an occupation of undetermined length  with undetermined costs  and undetermined consequences ' the full accounting of those costs and consequences will only be known to history  but the picture is beginning to come into focus  nearly   americans have been killed in iraq  five times that number have suffered horrible wounds  seen and unseen  loved ones have been lost  dreams denied  children will grow up without fathers and mothers  parents have outlived their children  that is a cost of this war  when all is said and done  the price tag will run over a trillion dollars  a trillion dollars  that's money not spent on homeland security and counter terrorism  on providing health care to all americans and a world class education to every child  on investments in energy to save ourselves and our planet from an addiction to oil  that is a cost of this war  the excellence of our military is unmatched  but as a result of this war  our forces are under pressure as never before  our national guard and reserves have half of the equipment they need to respond to emergencies at home and abroad  retention among west point graduates is down  our powers of deterrence and influence around the world are down  that is a cost of this war  america's standing has suffered  our diplomacy has been compromised by a refusal to talk to people we don't like  our alliances have been compromised by bluster  our credibility has been compromised by a faulty case for war  our moral leadership has been compromised by abu ghraib  that is a cost of this war  perhaps the saddest irony of the administration's cynical use of   is that the iraq war has left us less safe than we were before   osama bin ladin and his top lieutenants have rebuilt a new base in pakistan where they freely train recruits  plot new attacks  and disseminate propaganda  the taliban is resurgent in afghanistan  iran has emerged as the greatest strategic challenge to america in the middle east in a generation  violent extremism has increased  terrorism has increased  all of that is a cost of this war  after   instead of the politics of unity  we got a political strategy of division with the war in iraq as its centerpiece  the only thing we were asked to do for our country was support a misguided war  we lost that sense of common purpose as americans  and we're not going to be a truly united and resolute america until we can stop holding our breath  until we can come together to reclaim our foreign policy and our politics and end this war that has cost us so much  so there is something unreal about the debate that's taking place in washington  with all that our troops and their families have sacrificed  with all this war has cost us  and with no discernible end in sight  the same people who told us we would be greeted as liberators  about democracy spreading across the middle east  about striking a decisive blow against terrorism  about an insurgency in its last throes   those same people are now trumpeting the uneven and precarious containment of brutal sectarian violence as if it validates all of their failed decisions  the bar for success is so low that it is almost buried in the sand  the american people have had enough of the shifting spin  we've had enough of extended deadlines for benchmarks that go unmet  we've had enough of mounting costs in iraq and missed opportunities around the world  we've had enough of a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged  i opposed this war from the beginning  i opposed the war in   i opposed it in   i opposed it in   i opposed it in   i opposed it in   i introduced a plan in january to remove all of our combat brigades by next march  and i am here to say that we have to begin to end this war now  my plan for ending the war would turn the page in iraq by removing our combat troops from iraq's civil war  by taking a new approach to press for a new accord on reconciliation within iraq  by talking to all of iraq's neighbors to press for a compact in the region  and by confronting the human costs of this war  first  we need to immediately begin the responsible removal of our troops from iraq's civil war  our troops have performed brilliantly  they brought saddam hussein to justice  they have fought for over four years to give iraqis a chance for a better future  but they cannot   and should not   bear the responsibility for resolving the grievances at the heart of iraq's civil war  recent news only confirms this  the administration points to selective statistics to make the case for staying the course  killings and mortar attacks and car bombs in certain districts are down from the highest levels we've seen  but they're still at the same horrible levels they were at   months ago or two years ago  experts will tell you that the killings are down in some places because the ethnic cleansing has already taken place  that's hardly a cause for triumphalism  the stated purpose of the surge was to enable iraq's leaders to reconcile  but as the recent report from the government accountability office confirms  the iraqis are not reconciling  our troops fight and die in the   degree heat to give iraq's leaders space to agree  but they aren't filling it  they are not moving beyond their centuries old sectarian conflicts  they are falling further back into them  we hear a lot about how violence is down in parts of anbar province  but this has little to do with the surge   it's because sunni tribal leaders made a political decision to turn against al qaeda in iraq  this only underscores the point   the solution in iraq is political  it is not military  violence is contained in some parts of baghdad  that's no surprise  our troops have cleared these neighborhoods at great costs  but our troops cannot police baghdad indefinitely   only iraqis can  rather than use our presence to make progress  the iraqi government has put off taking responsibility   that's the finding of a commission headed by general jim jones  and our troop presence cannot be sustained without crippling our military's ability to respond to other contingencies  let me be clear  there is no military solution in iraq  and there never was  the best way to protect our security and to pressure iraq's leaders to resolve their civil war is to immediately begin to remove our combat troops  not in six months or one year   now  we should enter into talks with the iraqi government to discuss the process of our drawdown  we must get out strategically and carefully  removing troops from secure areas first  and keeping troops in more volatile areas until later  but our drawdown should proceed at a steady pace of one or two brigades each month  if we start now  all of our combat brigades should be out of iraq by the end of next year  we will need to retain some forces in iraq and the region  we'll continue to strike at al qaeda in iraq  we'll protect our forces as they leave  and we will continue to protect u s  diplomats and facilities  if   but only if   iraq makes political progress and their security forces are not sectarian  we should continue to train and equip those forces  but we will set our own direction and our own pace  and our direction must be out of iraq  the future of our military  our foreign policy  and our national purpose cannot be hostage to the inaction of the iraqi government  removing our troops is part of applying real pressure on iraq's leaders to end their civil war  some argue that we should just replace prime minister maliki  but that wouldn't solve the problem  we shouldn't be in the business of supporting coups  and remember   before maliki  we said that we just needed to replace the last prime minister to make everything all right  it didn't work  the problems in iraq are bigger than one man  iraq needs a new constitutional convention that would include representatives from all levels of iraqi society   in and out of government  the united nations should play a central role in convening and participating in this convention  which should not adjourn until a new accord on national reconciliation is reached  to reconcile  the iraqis must also meet key political benchmarks outside of the constitutional process  including new local elections and revising debaathification  now the iraqis may come out of this process choosing some kind of soft partition into three regions   one sunni  one shia  one kurd  but it must be their choice  america should not impose the division of iraq  while we change the dynamic within iraq  we must surge our diplomacy in the region  at every stage of this war  we have suffered because of disdain for diplomacy  we have not brought allies to the table  we have refused to talk to people we don't like  and we have failed to build a consensus in the region  as a result  iraq is more violent  the region is less stable  and america is less secure  we need to launch the most aggressive diplomatic effort in recent history to reach a new compact in the region  this effort should include all of iraq's neighbors  and we should also bring in the united nations security council  all of us have a stake in iraq's stability  it's time to make this less about what america is trying to do for iraq  and more about what the world can do with iraq  this compact must secure iraq's borders  keep neighbors from meddling  isolate al qaeda  and support iraq's unity  that means helping our turkish and kurdish friends reach an understanding  that means pressing sunni states like saudi arabia to stop the flow of foreign fighters into iraq  increase their financial support of reconstruction efforts  and encourage iraqi sunnis to reconcile with their fellow iraqis  and that means turning the page on the bush cheney policy of not talking to syria and iran  conventional thinking in washington says presidents cannot lead this diplomacy  but i think the american people know better  not talking doesn't make us look tough   it makes us look arrogant  and it doesn't get results  strong presidents tell their adversaries where they stand  and that's what i would do  that's how tough and principled diplomacy works  and that's what we need to press syria and iran to stop being part of the problem in iraq  iran poses a grave challenge  it builds a nuclear program  supports terrorism  and threatens israel with destruction  but we hear eerie echoes of the run up to the war in iraq in the way that the president and vice president talk about iran  they conflate iran and al qaeda  ignoring the violent schism that exists between shiite and sunni militants  they issue veiled threats  they suggest that the time for diplomacy and pressure is running out when we haven't even tried direct diplomacy  well george bush and dick cheney must hear   loud and clear   from the american people and the congress  you don't have our support  and you don't have our authorization for another war  george bush suggests that there are two choices with regard to iran  stay the course in iraq or cede the region to the iran  i reject this choice  keeping our troops tied down in iraq is not the way to weaken iran   it's precisely what has strengthened it  president ahmadinejad may talk about filling a vacuum in the region after an american drawdown  but he's badly mistaken  it's time for a new and robust american leadership  and that should begin with a new cooperative security framework with all of our friends and allies in the persian gulf  now is the time for tough and sustained diplomacy backed by real pressure  it's time to rally the region and the world to our side  and it's time to deliver a direct message to tehran  america is a part of a community of nations  america wants peace in the region  you can give up your nuclear ambitions and support for terror and rejoin the community of nations  or you will face further isolation  including much tighter sanctions  as we deliver this message  we will be stronger   not weaker   if we are disengaging from iraq's civil war  the final part of my plan is a major international initiative to address iraq's humanitarian crisis  president bush likes to warn of the dire consequences of ending the war  he warns of rising iranian influence  but that has already taken place  he warns of growing terrorism  but that has already taken place  and he warns of huge movements of refugees and mass sectarian killing  but that has already taken place  these are not the consequences of a future withdrawal  they are the reality of iraq's present  they are a direct consequence of waging this war  two million iraqis are displaced in their own country  another two million iraqis have fled as refugees to neighboring countries  this mass movement of people is a threat to the security of the middle east and to our common humanity  we have a strategic interest   and a moral obligation   to act  the president would have us believe there are two choices  keep all of our troops in iraq or abandon these iraqis  i reject that choice  we cannot continue to put this burden on our troops alone  i'm tired of this notion that we either fight foolish wars or retreat from the world  we are better than that as a nation  there's no military solution that can reunite a family or resettle an orphaned child  it's time to form an international working group with the countries in the region  our european and asian friends  and the united nations  the state department says it has invested   million on displaced iraqis this year   but that is not nearly enough  we can and must do more  we should up our share to at least   billion to support this effort  to expand access to social services for refugees in neighboring countries  and to ensure that iraqis displaced inside their own country can find safe haven  iraqis must know that those who engage in mass violence will be brought to justice  we should lead in forming a commission at the u n  to monitor and hold accountable perpetrators of war crimes within iraq  we must also put strict conditions on u s  assistance to direct our support to those who want to hold iraq together   not those who are tearing it apart  the risk of greater atrocities in the short term cannot deter us from doing what we must to minimize violence in the long term  yet as we drawdown  we must declare our readiness to intervene with allies to stop genocidal violence  we must also keep faith with iraqis who kept faith with us  one tragic outcome of this war is that the iraqis who stood with america   the interpreters  embassy workers  and subcontractors   are being targeted for assassination  an iraqi named laith who worked for an american organization told a journalist   sometimes i feel like we're standing in line for a ticket  waiting to die ' and yet our doors are shut  in april  we admitted exactly one iraqi refugee   just one  that is not how we treat our friends  that is not how we take responsibility for our own actions  that is not who we are as americans  it's time to at least fill the   slots that we pledged to iraqi refugees and to be open to accepting even more iraqis at risk  it's also time to go to our friends and allies   and all the members of our original coalition in iraq   to find homes for the many iraqis who are in desperate need of asylum  keeping this moral obligation is a key part of how we turn the page in iraq  because what's at stake is bigger than this war   it's our global leadership  now is a time to be bold  we must not stay the course or take the conventional path because the other course is unknown  to quote dr  brzezinski   we must not allow ourselves to become  prisoners of uncertainty ' george bush is afraid of this future  that is why all he can do is drag up the past  after all the flawed justifications for his failed policy  he now invokes vietnam as a reason to stay in iraq  let's put aside the strange reasoning   that all would have been well if we had just stayed the course in vietnam  let's put it aside and leave it where it belongs   in the past  now is not the time to reargue the vietnam war   we did that in the   election  and it wasn't pretty  i come from a new generation of americans  i don't want to fight the battles of the  s  i want to reclaim the future for america  because we have too many threats to face and too many opportunities to seize  just think about what we can accomplish together when we end this war  when we end this war in iraq  we can finally finish the fight in afghanistan  that is why i propose stepping up our commitment there  with at least two additional combat brigades and a comprehensive program of aid and support to help afghans help themselves  when we end this war in iraq  we can more effectively tackle the twin demons of extremism and hopelessness that threaten the peace of the world and the security of america  that is why i have proposed a program to spread hope   not hate   in the islamic world  to build schools that teach young people to build and not destroy  to support the rule of law and economic development  and to launch a program of outreach to the islamic world that i will lead as president  when we end this war in iraq  we can once again lead the world against the common challenges of the  st century  against the spread of nuclear weapons and climate change  against genocide in darfur  against ignorance and intolerance  corruption and greed  poverty and despair  when we end this war  we can reclaim the cause of freedom and democracy  we can be that beacon of hope  that light to all the world  when we end this war  we can recapture our unity of effort as americans  the american people have the right instincts on iraq  it's time to heed their judgment  it's time to move beyond iraq so that we can move forward together  i will be a president who listens to the american people  not a president who ignores them  and when we end the war in iraq  we can come together to give our full attention to advancing the cause of health care for every american  an energy policy that does not bankroll hostile nations while we melt the polar ice caps  and a world class education for our children  above all  we can turn the page to a new kind of politics of unity  not division  of hope  not fear  you know  i welcome all of the folks who have changed their position on the war over these last months and years  and we need more of those votes to change if we're going to change the direction of this war  that is why i will keep speaking directly to my colleagues in the congress  both republican and democratic  historically  we have come together in a bipartisan way to deal with our most monumental challenges  we should do so again  we have the power to do this   not as republicans or democrats  but as americans  we don't have to wait until george bush is gone from office   we can begin to end this war today  right now  but if we have learned anything from iraq  it is that the judgment that matters most is the judgment that is made first  martin luther king once stood up at riverside church and said   in this unfolding conundrum of life and history  there is such a thing as being too late ' we are too late to stop a war that should never have been fought  too late to undo the pain of battle  the anguish of so many families  or the price of the fight  too late to redo the years of division and distraction at home and abroad  but i'm here today because it's not too late to come together as americans  because we're not going to be able to deal with the challenges that confront us until we end this war  what we can do is say that we will not be prisoners of uncertainty  that we reject the conventional thinking that led us into iraq and that didn't ask hard questions until it was too late  what we can say is that we are ready for something new and something bold and something principled  it's time for us to breathe again  that begins with ending this war   but it does not end there  it's time reclaim our foreign policy  it's time to reclaim our politics  and it's time to lead this country   and this world   again  to a new dawn of peace and unity   em as prepared for delivery em "], ["obama1", "seventy five years ago this week  governor franklin delano roosevelt took his campaign for the presidency to the commonwealth club in san francisco  it was a time when faith in the american economy was shaken   a time when too many of our leaders clung to the conventional thinking that said all we could do is sit idly by and wish that our problems would go away on their own  but franklin roosevelt challenged that cynicism  amid a crisis of confidence roosevelt called for a  re appraisal of values  he made clear that in this country  our right to live must also include the right to live comfortably  that government must favor no small group at the expense of all its citizens  and that in order for us to prosper as one nation   the responsible heads of finance and industry  instead of acting each for himself  must work together to achieve the common end this vision of america would require change that went beyond replacing a failed president  it would require a renewed trust in the market and a renewed spirit of obligation and cooperation between business and workers  between a people and their government  as fdr put it   faith in america  faith in our tradition of personal responsibility  faith in our institutions  and faith in ourselves demands that we all recognize the new terms of the old social contract  seventy five years later  this faith is calling us to act once more  we certainly do not face a test of the magnitude that roosevelt's generation did  but we are tested still  we meet at a time when much of wall street is holding its collective breath  here at the nasdaq and all across america  the tickers are being watched with heightened anxiety and considerable uncertainty  there is much anticipation about tomorrow's meeting of the fed  and with each new day  there is hope that the headlines will bring better news than the last  it is a hope shared by millions of americans  men and women  who have experienced this kind of anxiety and uncertainty long before it arrived on wall street  they are the families i meet every day who are working longer hours for a paycheck that isn't getting any bigger and can't seem to cover the rising cost of health care and tuition and taxes  they are the maytag workers i've met in galesburg  illinois and newton  iowa   workers who believed they would retire and never have to work again  workers who now compete with their teenagers for minimum wage jobs at wal mart because their factory moved overseas these americans and many others were already struggling before the problems on wall street arose  now they are looking at their homes and wondering if their greatest source of wealth will still have the same value in another year  or even another month  and we're all wondering whether this will spill over to the wider economy  so we know there is a need right now to restore confidence in our markets  we know there is a need to renew public trust in our markets  but i also think that this is another moment that requires  in fdr's words  a re appraisal of our values as a nation i believe that america's free market has been the engine of america's great progress  it's created a prosperity that is the envy of the world  it's led to a standard of living unmatched in history  and it has provided great rewards to the innovators and risk takers who have made america a beacon for science  and technology  and discovery  but i also know that in this country  our grand experiment has only worked because we have guided the market's invisible hand with a higher principle  it's the idea that we are all in this together  from ceos to shareholders  from financiers to factory workers  we all have a stake in each other's success because the more americans prosper  the more america prospers  that's why we've had titans of industry who've made it their mission to pay well enough that their employees could afford the products they made  that's why employees at companies like google don't mind the vast success of their ceos   because they share in that success just the same  and that's why our economy hasn't just been the world's greatest wealth creator   it's been the world's greatest job generator  it's been the tide that has lifted the boats of the largest middle class in history  we have not come this far because we practice survival of the fittest  america is america because we believe in creating a framework in which all can succeed  our free market was never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get  however you can get it  and so from time to time  we have put in place certain rules of the road to make competition fair  and open  and honest  we have done this not to stifle prosperity or liberty  but to foster those things and ensure that they are shared and spread as widely as possible in recent years  we have seen a dangerous erosion of the rules and principles that have allowed our market to work and our economy to thrive  instead of thinking about what's good for america or what's good for business  a mentality has crept into certain corners of washington and the business world that says   what's good for me is good enough  in our government  we see campaign contributions and lobbyists used to cut corners and win favors that stack the deck against businesses and consumers who play by the rules  massive tax cuts are shoved outside the budget window and accounting shenanigans are used to hide the full cost of this war  in the business world  it's a mentality that sees conflicts of interest as opportunities for profit  the quick kill is prized without regard to long term consequences for the financial system and the economy  and while this may benefit the few who push the envelope as far as it will go  it's doesn't benefit america and it doesn't benefit the market  just because it makes money doesn't mean it's good for business it's bad for business when boards allow their executives to set the price of their stock options to guarantee that they'll get rich regardless of how they perform  it's bad for the bottom line when ceos receive massive severance packages after letting down shareholders  firing workers and dumping their pensions  or when they throw lavish birthday parties with company funds it's bad for competition when you have an administration that's willing to approve merger after merger with barely any scrutiny  such an approach stifles innovation  it robs consumers of choice  it means higher prices  and we have to guard against it  and it's bad for the market when there are over   trillion worth of loopholes in the corporate tax code  or when some companies get to set up a mailbox in a foreign country to avoid paying any taxes at all  this means a greater share of taxes for americans and small businesses that are trying to compete but can't afford to lobby their way to more loopholes  it also means that investment goes to the companies that are best connected instead of the ones that are most productive  economics   tells us special interest politics distorts the free market  after all  why would an oil company invest in research for alternative fuels that could save our environment when they can get billions of dollars in subsidies to keep drilling for oil and gas these anti market  anti business practices are wasteful  unproductive  and antithetical to the very spirit of capitalism  they benefit the undeserving few at the expense of hardworking americans and entrepreneurs who play by the rules  in fact  the danger with this mentality isn't just that it offends our morals  it's that it endangers our markets  markets can't thrive without the trust of investors and the public  at a most basic level  capital markets work by steering capital to the place where it is most productive  without transparency  that cannot happen  if the information is flawed  if there is fraud  or if the risks facing financial institutions are not fully disclosed  people stop investing because they fear they're being had  when the public trust is abused badly enough  it can bring financial markets to their knees  we all suffer when we do not ensure that markets are transparent  open and honest we saw this during the dotcom boom of the  s when conflicts of interest between securities analysts  whose research was supposed to guide investors  and the banks they worked for led investors to doubt the markets in general  we saw it during the enron and worldcom scandals when major public companies artificially pumped up their earnings  disguised their losses and otherwise engaged in accounting fraud to make their profits look better   a practice that ultimately led investors to question the balance sheets of all companies and we cannot help but see some reflections of these practices when we look at the subprime mortgage fiasco today  subprime lending started off as a good idea   helping americans buy homes who couldn't previously afford to  financial institutions created new financial instruments that could securitize these loans  slice them into finer and finer risk categories and spread them out among investors around the country and around the world  in theory  this should have allowed mortgage lending to be less risky and more diversified  but as certain lenders and brokers began to see how much money could be made  they began to lower their standards  some appraisers began inflating their estimates to get the deals done  some borrowers started claiming income they didn't have just to qualify for the loans  and some were engaging in irresponsible speculation  but many borrowers were tricked into glossing over the fine print  and ratings agencies began rating bundles of different kinds of these loans as low risk even though they were very high risk most everyone knew that some of these deals were just too good to be true  but all that money flowing in made it tempting to look the other way and ignore the unscrupulous practice of some bad actors and yet  time and again we were warned this could happen  ned gramlich  the former fed governor who sadly passed away two weeks ago  wrote an entire book predicting this very situation  repeated calls for better disclosure and stronger oversight were met with millions in mortgage industry lobbying  far too many continued to put their own short term gain ahead of what they knew the long term consequences would be when those rates exploded  those consequences are now clear  nearly   million homeowners could lose their homes  millions more who had nothing to do with this could see the value of their own home decline   with some estimates projecting a cost of nearly   billion  primarily in lost home equity  the projected cost to investors is nearly   billion worldwide  and the impact on the housing market and wider economy has been so great that some economists are now predicting a possible recession   a prediction all of us hope does not come to pass  there are a number of lessons that we must learn from this going forward  we know that much of this could have been avoided if the market operated with more honesty and accountability  we also know we would have been far better off if there were greater transparency and more information had been available to the american people  to that extent  i believe there are a few steps we should take to prevent future crises of this kind and restore some measure of public trust in the market  first  we need more disclosure and accountability in the housing market  to ensure that potential homeowners aren't tricked into purchasing loans they can't afford  i've proposed updating the current mortgage rules to establish a federal definition of mortgage fraud and enact tough penalties against lenders who knowingly act in bad faith  i've also proposed a home score system that would create a simplified  standardized metric for home mortgages  sort of like the apr  this would empower americans to make smart decisions by allowing prospective buyers to easily compare various mortgage products so they can find out whether they can afford the payments  and i believe we should finally enact the meaningful mortgage disclosure laws that the mortgage industry has been lobbying against for far too long  second  i believe that if we hope to restore trust in the markets  we must be able to trust the judgment of our rating agencies  the failure of government to exercise adequate oversight over the rating agencies will cost investors and public pension funds billions of dollars   losses we have not yet fully recognized  we cannot let the public trust be lost by a conflict of interest between the rating agencies and the people they're rating  as arthur levitt recently reminded us  this happened when rating agencies continued to give a rosy outlook for enron despite its impending bankruptcy  and of course we saw it this year when subprime mortgage loans continued to receive strong ratings despite repeated warnings of the instability of the mortgages and the impending slowdown of the housing market  here's the real danger   if the public comes to view this like the accounting analyses of enron  the markets will be ravished by a crisis in confidence  we must take steps to avoid that at all costs  and that is why i believe there should be an immediate investigation of the relationship and business practices of rating agencies and their clients  the third thing we need to do is look at other areas in the market where a lack of transparency could lead to similar problems  many of the people who hold these subprime mortgages are now shifting their debt to credit cards  and if they do not understand the commitments they're taking on  or are subjected to predatory practices  this could fester into a second crisis down the road  that's why i'm proposing a five star credit card rating system to inform consumers about the level of risk involved in every credit card they sign up for  including how easily the company can change the interest rate  if more americans were armed with this kind of information before they purchased risky mortgage loans  the current crisis might not have happened  now that so many are in debt  we shouldn't let the same lax standards create another  finally  while it's not my place to comment on the actions of the fed  i have heard many of you say that you hope for a sizable rate cut tomorrow to soothe the market turmoil  but i also know that there are nearly   million americans who may lose their homes no matter what happens tomorrow  and so for those institutions that are holding these mortgages  i ask them to show some flexibility to folks trying to sell or refinance their houses  they are in the same liquidity pinch as companies are  but they don't have the same resources available to protect themselves now  in addition to these immediate steps  i also believe there is a larger lesson to be learned from the subprime crisis  in this modern  interconnected economy  there is no dividing line between main street and wall street  the decisions that are made in new york's high rises and hedge funds matter and have consequences for millions of americans across the country  and whether those americans keep their homes or their jobs  whether they can spend with confidence and avoid falling into debt   that matters and has consequences for the entire market  we all have a stake in each other's success  we all have a stake in ensuring that the market is efficient and transparent  that it inspires trust and confidence  that it rewards those who are truly successful instead of those who are just successful at gaming the system  because if the last few months have taught us anything  it's that we can all suffer from the excesses of a few  turning a blind eye to the cronyism in our midst can put us all in jeopardy  and we cannot accept that in the united states of america  so i promise you this  i will be a president who believes in your success  i will value your contribution to this country and i will do what i can to encourage it  because i understand that how well you do is inextricably linked to how well america does  and i will always be a strong advocate for a market that is free and open  but today i am asking you to join me in saying that in this country  we will not tolerate a market that is fixed  we will not tolerate a market that is rigged by lobbyists who don't represent the interests of real americans or most businesses  and we will not tolerate  what's good for me is good enough  any longer   because the only thing that's good enough is what's best for america  i am also asking you to join me in doing something else today  i am asking you to remind yourselves that in this country  we rise or fall as one people  and i am asking you to join me in ushering in a new era of mutual responsibility in america  right now there are millions of hardworking americans who have been struggling to get by for quite some time  they have watched their wages stagnate and their health costs rise and their pensions disappear  some have seen jobs shipped overseas and others have found new ones that pay much less  some tell their children they won't be able to afford college this year  others send their youngest to a school that is crumbling around them  i meet these americans every single day   people who believe they have been left on the sidelines by a global economy that has forever changed the rules of the game  they understand that revolutions in technology and communication have torn borders and opened up new markets and new opportunities  they know we can't go back to yesterday or wall off our economy from everyone else  their problem is not that our world is flat  it's that our playing field isn't level  it's that opportunity is no longer equal  and that's something we cannot accept anymore for too long we have had a president who has clung to the belief that there is nothing america can do about this  he has looked away from these challenges and peddled a philosophy of  what's bad for you is not my problem and if we are honest  i think we must admit that those who have benefited from the new global marketplace   and that includes almost everyone in this room   have not always concerned themselves with the losers in this new economy  there has been a tendency  during the boom times  to consider the casualties of a changing economy to be inevitable  and to justify outsized paydays or lower tax rates on wall street earnings as part of the natural order of things  indeed  rather than addressing this growing sense of uncertainty and constricting opportunity for millions of working class and middle class americans  this administration has accelerated these trends through its tax policies and spending priorities   to the point where there is greater income inequality now than at any time since the gilded age  it may be true  as some have argued  that larger forces are at work here   that technological advance and globalization have triggered a fundamental change in the economy  it is true as well that we cannot simply look backwards for solutions   to try to fence off the world beyond our borders  or to hope that the new deal programs born of a different era are  by themselves  somehow adequate to meet the challenges of the future  no  we are going to have to adapt our institutions to a new world as we always have  and in doing so  we have to remind ourselves that we rise and fall as one nation  that a country in which only a few prosper is antithetical to our ideals and our democracy  that those of us who have benefited greatly from the blessings of this country have a solemn obligation to open the doors of opportunity  not just for our children  but to all of america's children  and that unless we take immediate steps to realign the interests of all americans in growth and prosperity  we may generate a political climate that is inimical to both  and so  in the coming weeks  i will be laying out a  st century economic agenda for america  it's an agenda that will level the playing field for more americans to ensure that america can compete and thrive in a global economy  it will focus on three broad areas  tomorrow  i'll lay out the first part of my agenda   a plan to modernize and simplify our tax code so that it provides greater opportunity and more relief to more americans  for far too long  our tax code has been so riddled with special interest loopholes and giveaways that it's shifted the tax burden to small businesses and middle class americans  at a time when most americans are facing stagnant wages and rising costs  that's not fair and it doesn't benefit our economy  my plan will give a break to middle class americans  seniors  and the homeowners who are feeling today's anxiety and uncertainty  because i believe that we all have a stake in restoring their confidence and investing in their prosperity  the second part of my agenda will be to ensure america's competitive edge in the  st century  this starts with providing every american with a world class education from cradle to adulthood  we know that in this economy  countries that out educate us today will out compete us tomorrow  and we also know that china is already graduating four times as many engineers as we do and that our share of twenty four year olds with college degrees now falls somewhere between bulgaria and costa rica  we can't allow ourselves to fall behind  that means investing in early child education  it means recruiting an army of new  qualified teachers who we pay more and support more because we know how important their job is to the future of this country  and it means finally making a college education affordable and available to every american  tony blair once said that  talent is the  st century wealth  and i believe we all have a stake in nurturing that talent if we hope to prosper in this century  ensuring our competitive edge also means investing more in the science and technology that has fueled so much of our nation's economic growth  and one place where that investment would make an enormous difference to the future of this country is in a renewable energy policy that ends our addiction on foreign oil  we know this addiction isn't sustainable for our security  we know it's not sustainable for the planet  and i've talked to countless ceos and business leaders who know it's not sustainable for our economy to be held hostage to the spot oil market  i believe that we all have a stake in a renewable future that will create thousands of new jobs and entire new industries that can fuel our prosperity well into the next century  finally  the third part of my agenda will be to modernize and strengthen america's safety net for working americans  like all of you  i believe in free trade  but we have to acknowledge that for millions of americans  its burdens outweigh its benefits  and so if we want to avoid rising protectionism in this country  if we expect working americans to accept and even embrace free trade  then i believe we all have a stake in embracing policies that will provide them with a sense of security  that means health insurance and a pension that they can always count on  that means skills and training that can actually help people find a job  and that means wages that actually make work pay i ask for your support for this economic agenda  both in this campaign and if i should get the chance to enact these policies as your president  i will not pretend it will come without cost  but i do believe we can do achieve this in a fiscally responsible way   certainly more so than the current administration that's given us deficits as far as the eye can see  i know some may say it's anathema to come to wall street and call for shared sacrifice so that all americans can benefit from this new economy of ours  but i believe that all of you are as open and willing to listen as anyone else in america  i believe you care about this country and the future we are leaving to the next generation  i believe your work to be a part of building a stronger  more vibrant  and more just america  i think the problem is that no one has asked you to play a part in the project of american renewal  i also realize that there are some who will say that achieving all of this is far too difficult  that it is too hard to build consensus  that we are too divided and self interested to think about the responsibilities we have to each other and to our country  that the times are simply too tough  but then i am reminded that we have been in tougher times and we have faced far more difficult challenges  and each time we have emerged stronger  more united  and more prosperous than the last  it is faith in the american ideal that carries us through  as well as the belief that was voiced by franklin roosevelt all those years ago this week   failure is not an american habit  and in the strength of great hope we must all shoulder our common load  that is the strength and the hope we seek both today   and in all the days and months to come "], ["obama1", "yesterday i spoke about the future of the american economy at the nasdaq  and in many ways  nasdaq is a symbol of the new economy that's taking hold   the wealth created  the booms and bubbles  the technology that's helping to drive growth  and the interconnectedness that now spans the globe  it's no secret that a fundamental transformation of our economy is taking place  in books and on balance sheets  at policy institutes and around kitchen tables  people are trying to make sense of where the swift and strong currents of globalization are taking us  what we do know is that americans are living and working in a rapidly changing economic reality  this isn't the first time this has happened  time and again  the american economy has undergone upheaval   from slave to free  from agriculture to industry  from peace to war time  and from war time to peace  and time and again  the american economy has emerged stronger  the one constant has been the advancement of individual opportunity  there are few principles more basic to our country  and there is none more basic to our economy  we believe that there is a place in the american economy for every american's dream  and we know that when we extend that dream of opportunity to more americans  all of us gain  americans also know that opportunity doesn't come easy  you have to work for it  here i think of my father in law  fraser robinson  he raised his two children with his wife marian in  s chicago  they faced what other african american families faced at the time   both hidden and overt forms of racism that limited their effort to get ahead  and they faced an additional obstacle  at age   fraser was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis  and yet  every day of his life  even when he had to leave an hour earlier in the morning and rely on a walker to get him there  he went to work at the local water filtration plant while marian stayed home with the children  and on that single salary  fraser robinson provided for his family  sending my wife michelle and her brother craig to princeton  this is an american story that plays out in millions of families each and every day  it is a story that is shared by the caregiver who is up before dawn and the teacher who never misses the bell  by the trader who works late and the janitor on the night shift  it is the story of a society that values work  and of people who work to create a better future for their families  this story could not exist without a basic social compact in this country  that compact says that if you work hard  your work will be rewarded  that everybody has an opportunity to make a decent living  to raise a family  to give their children the best chance at success  and to look forward to a secure retirement  that people like fraser and marian robinson can give their children the chance to dream bigger  and to reach new horizons  that social compact is starting to crumble  in our new economy  there is no shortage of new wealth  but wages are not keeping pace  workers are more vulnerable to job loss and more worried about retirement  those americans fortunate enough to have health care are paying more for it   health care premiums have risen nearly   in the last six years  americans are facing deeper personal debt  from filling up the gas tank to paying for a college education  everything seems to cost more  this is not just happening by chance  it's not something we can just chalk up to temporary shocks  it's happening in part because of the choices we're making  and the way that we're making those choices  it's happening because we've gone too far from being a country where we're all in this together  to a country where everyone's on their own  today  i'm going to focus on one aspect of our economic policy where we need to make different choices  because nowhere is this shift in our priorities more evident than in our tax policies  instead of working to find ways to relieve the burden on the middle class  we've developed creative ways to remove the burden from the well off  instead of having all of us pay our fair share  we've got over   trillion worth of loopholes in the corporate tax code  this isn't the invisible hand of the market at work  it's the successful work of special interests  for decades  we've seen a successful strategy to ride anti tax sentiment in this country toward tax cuts that favor wealth  not work  and for decades  we've seen the gaps in wealth in this country grow wider  while the costs to working people are greater  we've got a shift in our tax values that disproportionately benefits the wealthiest americans  corporate carve outs that serve no national purpose  tax breaks that allow companies to stash their profits overseas  a government that's paralyzed when dealing with offshore tax haven countries  an overloaded tax code that's too complicated for ordinary folks to understand  but just complicated enough to work for someone who knows how to work the system  when big business doesn't like something in the tax code  they can hire a lobbyist to get it changed  but most working people can't afford a high priced lobbyist  instead of honoring that core american value   opportunity for all   we've had a system in washington where our laws and regulations have carved out opportunities for the few  the numbers don't lie  at a time when income inequality is growing sharper  the bush tax cuts gave the wealthiest   percent of americans a tax cut that was twice as large as the middle class  at a time when americans are working harder than ever  we are taxing income from work at nearly twice the level that we're taxing gains for investors  talk about this in polite company  and sooner or later you'll get accused of waging class warfare  as if it's distasteful to point out that some ceos make more in ten minutes than a worker makes in ten months  or  as my friend warren buffet put it to me    if there's class warfare going on in america  then my class is winning  what warren buffett knows is what all americans have to remember   to get through these uncertain times  we have to recognize that we all have a stake in one another's success  when folks are hurting out there on main street  that's not good for wall street  when the changes in our economy are leaving too many people behind  the competitiveness of our country risks falling behind  when that dream of opportunity is denied to too many americans  then ultimately that pain has a way of trickling up  we welcome success stories here in america  we admire those who have climbed to the top of the ladder  we just need to be sure that the ladder doesn't get taken away from the rest of us  we want a system based on fairness   not special favors  to steer a course through the change that's taking hold  we have to hold tight to that core principle  that our economy must advance opportunity for all americans  my own experience over two decades tells me that when you give people a chance at that opportunity  they will take it  that's what i found as a community organizer on the south side of chicago  where we set up job training programs and after school programs and counseling programs to bring hope to places that had been hurt by change  that's what i found as a state senator in illinois when we created the state earned income tax credit so we could put   million of tax cuts into the pockets of working families  that's what i've been focused on as a united states senator  as i've worked to expand the child tax credit to include children in minimum wage families  and to close loopholes that shift the tax burden on to working people  and that's what i'll do as president  because when it comes to our economy  the american people are not the problem   they are the answer  i'll restore simplicity to the tax code  and fairness for the american middle class  it's time to stand up to special interest carve outs  i'll end the preferential treatment that's built into our tax code by eliminating corporate loopholes and tax breaks  we shouldn't be distorting our tax code to benefit a few powerful interests   we should be insisting that everyone pays their fair share  and when i'm president  they will  and it's time to shed some sunlight not only on companies that abuse the tax code  but also on the secretive offshore tax havens that shelter them  we'll create a list of countries where tax evaders hide their income and cost america untold billions of dollars every year  we'll lead the international community to new standards of information sharing  and we'll penalize companies and individuals who use those havens and illegally evade their tax obligations  if we're going to keep that social compact for a new century  we need a tax code that's fair   a tax code that rewards work and advances opportunity  every american who is ready to work for their american dream should be able to trust that they have a government that works for them  i'll keep that trust by cutting taxes for working people  homeowners  and seniors  and by simplifying tax filing for middle class americans  first  i'll give a tax cut to working people  the american people work longer and harder than the people of any other wealthy nation in the world  but their hours are getting longer and their wages aren't getting any higher  their costs are going up  but their economic security is going down  when a single mom gets her paycheck  that check gets taxed  when she goes to buy groceries  that purchase gets taxed  when she reaches her retirement  her social security benefit gets taxed  meanwhile  her boss's investments get taxed at a lower rate  and the corporation she works for has all kinds of loopholes built into the tax code because they've got lobbyists in washington sticking up for their interests  it's time for that to change  it's time for americans to have a president in the oval office who makes decisions based on their interest  not the special interests  let's not forget that even in this era of economic change  our wealth as a nation remains founded on work  i'd reward work by providing an income tax cut of up to   per person   or   for each working family   to offset the payroll tax that they're already paying  at a time when confidence in the american economy is unsteady  this will give middle class americans a break  and help them deal with the rising costs of energy  education  and saving for retirement  under my plan    million americans   and their families   will get a tax cut  and because this credit would be greater than their income tax bill  my proposal would eliminate all income taxes for   million working americans  in so many working families  two parents are working full time  trying to bring up their children  and trying to keep up with so many costs that keep growing while their paychecks don't  this tax credit will strengthen working families by increasing the money in their pockets  and reducing the worry that hangs over so many americans  and this tax credit will be a particular boost to single working moms  who put in the hours to provide the best opportunities possible for their kids  but struggle to stretch a paycheck that can't cover their growing needs  the second thing i'll do to ease the burden on the middle class is provide a universal homeowners' tax credit  if work is how most americans seek their dream  a home is how many families realize it  a home is a source of stability  a building block for communities  and the most valuable thing that most middle class folks will own  but   as has been made painfully clear through the sub prime crisis   that source of stability can quickly become the source of economic insecurity  too many americans are struggling under the weight of their mortgages  homeowners need a break  today  we have a mortgage interest deduction  but it only goes to people who itemize on their taxes  like so much in our tax code  this tilts the scales toward the well off  only a third of homeowners take advantage of this credit  i'll create a mortgage interest credit so that both itemizers and non itemizers get a break  this will immediately benefit   million homeowners in america  the vast majority of these are folks who make under   per year  who will get a break of   percent of their mortgage interest rate  for most middle class families  this will add up to about   each year  this credit will also extend a hand to many of the millions of americans who are stuck in the subprime crisis by giving them some breathing room to refinance or sell their homes  the third thing i'll do is provide a progressive tax cut for america's seniors  since the new deal  we've had a basic understanding in america  if you work hard and pay into the system  you've earned the right to a secure retirement  but even though they've held up their end of the bargain  many seniors are struggling to keep pace with costs  and as so many americans know  their worry becomes an entire family's worry  this strain has been greater since   when taxes on social security benefits were raised  millions of seniors saw their net benefits go down  they also had to take on the added strain   and sometimes cost   of filing a complicated tax return  it's time to give america's seniors a break  so i'll give retired folks the same kind of relief i'll offer to working people  when i'm president  we'll work to see that no retiree making less than   each year has to pay income tax  this will eliminate income taxes for about   million americans  at a savings rate of roughly   each year  and   million seniors won't even have to file a return and hire an expensive tax preparer  the final part of my plan will be simplifying the process of filing a tax return for all americans  the tax code has become far too complex  deductions and exemptions are built into the system  but ordinary people don't have the time to figure them out without going to an expert preparer   yet another cost at tax time  in   the irs estimated that it took   hours for an individual to complete her tax filing  according to the irs national taxpayer advocate   the most serious problem facing taxpayers today is the complexity of the internal revenue code  this past year  usa today had five different professionals add up the tax bill for one working family   and they all got different answers  it's time to cut through the complexity  when i'm president  we'll put in place a system where   million americans with a job and a bank account who take the standard deduction can do their taxes in less than five minutes  the government already collects wage and bank account information  so there's no reason the irs can't send americans prefilled tax forms to verify  this mean's no more worry  no more wasted time  no more extra expenses for a tax preparer  making this change would save americans more than   billion in tax preparer fees  more than   million hours of work  and an incalculable amount of headache and heartburn  all of these proposals are about making america's tax code simpler  and making it work better for working americans  as we simplify the tax code so that it works for the middle class  we'll have to address shifting costs  americans are tired of an attitude toward taxing and spending in washington that is leaving a legacy of debt to our children and grandchildren  to ensure that we are fiscally responsible  we'll gain revenue by shutting down corporate loopholes and tax havens  we'll also turn the page on an approach that gives repeated tax cuts to the wealthiest   percent of americans even though they don't need them and didn't ask for them  we've lost the balance between work and wealth  i will close the carried interest loophole  and adjust the top dividends and capital gains rate to something closer to   but no greater than   the rates ronald reagan set in   as we make these changes  we'll be sure to encourage growth and innovation  so we'll exempt start up companies and small businesses from capital gains to give them an added boost  because when more americans tap that well of opportunity  all of us are better off  you know  the truth is  most americans aren't asking for a lot  they don't need overseas tax shelters or a long list of loopholes  they just want a fair shake  and they could stand a break  because most americans have simple dreams  a job  a place to raise their family  a secure retirement  a chance to create opportunities for their kids that might extend a little further than their own  after all  the wealth of our nation is rooted in the work of our people  in his first state of the union message to congress  abraham lincoln laid out a core principle   capital is only the fruit of labor  and could never have existed if labor had not first existed  labor is the superior of capital  and deserves much the higher consideration  it's a simple proposition  that the wealth we earn comes from the work that we do  it's a proposition that is lived  day in and day out  in the homes of millions of working americans  the steady pursuit of simple dreams  the american economy is the tally of all of those dreams  now   at a time of rising costs and rising uncertainty   it's time for polices from washington that put a little wind at the backs of the american people  now is the time for us to come together as a nation behind a new compact for the  st century   one that gives the american people a lift  so they can lift up this country anew "], ["obama1", "it's a privilege to be a part of today's convocation and an honor to receive this degree from howard  there are few other universities that have played so central a role in breaking down yesterday's barriers and inching this country closer to the ideals we see inscribed on the monuments throughout this city  it was howard that sent the first african american to the united states senate  it was howard that graduated the first african american to become governor and the first to become mayor of the largest city in the country  it was here  within the halls of this campus  where thurgood marshall huddled with the brilliant minds of his day to craft the arguments in brown v  board that ignited a movement that changed the world  and it is because of these victories that a black man named barack obama can stand before you today as a candidate for president of the united states of america  but i am not just running to make history  i'm running because i believe that together  we can change history's course  it's not enough just to look back in wonder of how far we've come   i want us to look ahead with a fierce urgency at how far we have left to go  i believe it's time for this generation to make its own mark   to write our own chapter in the american story  after all  those who came before us did not strike a blow against injustice only so that we would allow injustice to fester in our time  thurgood marshall did not argue brown so that we would accept a country where too many african american men end up in prison because we'd rather spend more to jail a  year old than to educate a five year old  dr  king did not take us to the mountaintop so that we would allow a terrible storm to ravage those who were stranded in the valley  he would not have expected that it would take a breach in our levees to reveal a breach in our compassion  that it would take a hurricane to reveal the hungry god asks us to feed  the sick he asks us to care for  the least of these he commands us to treat as our own  the teenagers and college students who left their homes to march in the streets of birmingham and montgomery  the mothers who walked instead of taking the bus after a long day of doing somebody else's laundry and cleaning somebody else's kitchen   they didn't brave fire hoses and billy clubs so that their grandchildren and their great grandchildren would still wonder at the beginning of the  st century whether their vote would be counted  whether their civil rights would be protected by their government  whether justice would be equal and opportunity would be theirs  and i am certain that nine children did not walk through the doors of a school in little rock so that our children would have to see nooses hanging at a school in louisiana  we have more work to do  it's a fitting reminder that the fiftieth anniversary of little rock fell on this week  because when the doors to that school finally opened  a nation responded  the president sent the united states army to stand on the side of justice  the congress passed the civil rights act of   the department of justice created a civil rights division  and millions of americans took to the streets in the following months and years so that more children could walk through more doors  these were not easy choices to make at the time  president eisenhower was warned by some that sending the army down to little rock would be political suicide  the resistance to civil rights reform was fierce  and we know that those who marched for freedom did so at great risk to themselves and their families  but they did it because they understood that sometimes there are moments when what's truly risky is not to act  what's truly risky is to let the same injustice remain year after year  what's truly risky is to walk away and pretend it never happened  what's truly risky is to accept things as they are instead of working for what could be  in a media driven culture that's more obsessed with who's beating who in washington and how long paris hilton is going to jail  these moments are harder to spot today  but every so often  they do appear  sometimes it takes a hurricane  and sometimes it takes a travesty of justice like the one we've seen in jena  louisiana  there are some who will make jena about the fight itself  and it's true that we have to do more as parents to instill in our children that violence is always wrong  it's wrong when it happens on the streets of chicago and it's wrong when it happens at a schoolyard in louisiana  violence is not the answer  non violence was the soul of the civil rights movement  and we have to do a better job of teaching our children that virtue  but we also know that to truly understand jena  you have to look at what happened both before and after that fight  you have to listen to the hateful slurs that flew through the halls of a school  you have to know the full measure of the damage done by that arson  you have to look at those nooses hanging on that schoolyard tree  and you have to understand how badly our system of justice failed those six boys in the days after that fight   the outrageous charges  the unreasonable and excessive sentences  the public defender who did not call a single witness  like katrina did with poverty  jena exposed glaring inequities in our justice system that were around long before that schoolyard fight broke out  it reminds us of the fact that we have a system that locks away too many young  first time  non violent offenders for the better part of their lives   a decision that's made not by a judge in a courtroom  but by politicians in washington  it reminds us that we have certain sentences that are based less on the kind of crime you commit than on what you look like and where you come from  it reminds us that we have a justice department whose idea of prosecuting civil rights violations is trying to rollback affirmative action programs at our college and universities  a justice department whose idea of prosecuting voting rights violations is to look for voting fraud in black and latino communities where it doesn't exist  we know these inequities are there  we know they're wrong  and yet they go largely unnoticed until people find the courage to stand up and say they're wrong  until someone finally says   it's wrong that scooter libby gets no jail time for compromising our national security  but a  year old honor student is still sitting in a georgia prison for something that wasn't even a felony  that's wrong  it's not always easy to stand up and say this  i commend those of you here at howard who have spoken out on jena   or traveled to the rally in louisiana  i commend those of you who've spoken out on the genarlow wilson case  i know it can be lonely protesting this kind of injustice  i know there's not a lot of glamour in it  when i was a state senator in illinois  we had a death penalty system that had sent thirteen innocent people to death row  thirteen innocent men   that we know of  i wanted to reform the system  and i was told by almost everyone that it wasn't possible  that i wouldn't be able to get police officers and civil rights advocates  democrats and republicans to all agree that we should videotape confessions to make sure they weren't coerced  folks told me that there was too much political risk involved  but i believed that it was too risky not to act  and after awhile people with opposing views came together and started listening  and we ended up reforming that death penalty system  and we did the same thing when i passed a law to expose racial profiling  so don't ever let anyone tell you that change isn't possible  don't let them tell you that speaking out and standing up against injustice is too risky  what's too risky is keeping quiet  what's too risky is looking the other way  i don't want to be standing here and talking about another jena four years from now because we didn't have the courage to act today  i don't want this to be another issue that ends up being ignored once the cameras are turned off and the headlines disappear  it's time to seek a new dawn of justice in america  from the day i take office as president  america will have a justice department that is truly dedicated to the work it began in the days after little rock  i will rid the department of ideologues and political cronies  and for the first time in eight years  the civil rights division will actually be staffed with civil rights lawyers who prosecute civil rights violations  and employment discrimination  and hate crimes  and we'll have a voting rights section that actually defends the right of every american to vote without deception or intimidation  when flyers are placed in our neighborhoods telling people to vote on the wrong day  that won't only be an injustice  it will be a crime  as president  i will also work every day to ensure that this country has a criminal justice system that inspires trust and confidence in every american  regardless of age  or race  or background  there's no reason that every single person accused of a crime shouldn't have a qualified public attorney to defend them  we'll recruit more public defenders to the profession by forgiving college and law school loans   and i will ask some of the brilliant minds here at howard to take advantage of that offer  there's also no reason we can't pass a racial profiling law like i did in illinois  or encourage state to reform the death penalty so that innocent people do not end up on death row  when i'm president  we will no longer accept the false choice between being tough on crime and vigilant in our pursuit of justice  dr  king said it's not either or  it's both and  we can have a crime policy that's both tough and smart  if you're convicted of a crime involving drugs  of course you should be punished  but let's not make the punishment for crack cocaine that much more severe than the punishment for powder cocaine when the real difference between the two is the skin color of the people using them  judges think that's wrong  republicans think that's wrong  democrats think that's wrong  and yet it's been approved by republican and democratic presidents because no one has been willing to brave the politics and make it right  that will end when i am president  i think it's time we also took a hard look at the wisdom of locking up some first time  non violent drug users for decades  someone once said that  long minimum sentences for first time users may not be the best way to occupy jail space and or heal people from their disease  that someone was george w  bush   six years ago  i don't say this very often  but i agree with the president  the difference is  he hasn't done anything about it  when i'm president  i will  we will review these sentences to see where we can be smarter on crime and reduce the blind and counterproductive warehousing of non violent offenders  and we will give first time  non violent drug offenders a chance to serve their sentence  where appropriate  in the type of drug rehabilitation programs that have proven to work better than a prison term in changing bad behavior  so let's reform this system  let's do what's smart  let's do what's just  now  there is no doubt that taking these steps will restore a measure of justice and equality to america  they will also restore a sense of confidence to the american people that the system doesn't just work   it works for everyone  but there is a broader point i want to make today  if i have the opportunity to lead this nation  i will always be a president who hears your voice and understands your concerns  a president whose story is like so many of your own   whose life's work has been the unfinished work of our long march towards justice  and i will stand up for you  and fight for you  and wake up every day thinking about how to make your lives better  but the truth is  one man cannot make a movement  no single law can erase the prejudice in the heart of a child who hangs a noose on a tree  or the callousness of a prosecutor who bypasses justice in the pursuit of vengeance  no one leader  no matter how shrewd or experienced  can prevent teenagers from killing other teenagers on the streets of our cities  or free our neighborhoods from the grip of hopelessness  or make real the promise of opportunity and equality for every citizen  only a country can do these things  only this country can do these things  and that is why if you give me the chance to serve this nation  the most important thing i will do as your president is ask you to serve it too  the most important thing i'll do is call on you every day to take a risk and do your part to carry this movement forward  against great odds and amidst deep cynicism  i will ask you to believe again that we can right the wrongs we see in america  i would not have driven out to chicago after college to organize jobless neighborhoods if i didn't believe this was possible  i wouldn't have organized a voter registration drive  or become a civil rights lawyer  or a constitutional law professor  or a state senator  or a u s  senator if i didn't believe this was possible  i would not be standing here today if i didn't believe this was possible  and i know that you believe it's possible too  one of the most inspiring things about the response to jena was that it did not begin with the actions of any one leader  the call went out to thousands across the internet and black radio and on college campuses like this one  and like the young americans of another era  you left your homes  and got on buses  and traveled south  it's what happened two years earlier when students here at howard and americans from every walk of life took it upon themselves to try and rescue a city that was drowning  it's how real change and true justice have always come about  it takes a movement to lift a nation  it will take a movement to go into our cities and say that it's not enough to just fix our criminal justice system  what we really need is to make sure that our kids don't end up there in the first place  we need to set up child care and after school programs and job training and drug counseling to give our children a place to turn to  and we need parents to start acting like parents and spend more time with their children and read to them once in awhile  it will take a movement to finish what began in topeka  kansas and little rock  arkansas  it will take a movement of americans from every city and town  of every race and background to stand up and say that no matter what you look like or where you come from  every child in america should have the opportunity to receive the best education this country has to offer  every child  it will take a movement to demand that we rebuild our crumbling schools  that we invest in early childhood education  that we recruit an army of new teachers  and pay them better  and support them more  it will take a movement to ensure that every young person gets the chance that howard gave all of you  to say that at the beginning of the  st century  a college education is no longer a luxury for those who can afford it  it is the birthright of every american  so when you go back to your classrooms and your dorm rooms and you begin another year at howard university  i ask you to remember how far we've come  but i urge you to think hard about where we need to go  i urge you to think about the risks you will take and the role you will play in building the movement that will get us there  and i ask you remember the story of moses and joshua  most of you know that moses was called by god to lead his people to the promised land  and in the face of a pharaoh and his armies  across an unforgiving desert and along the walls of an angry sea  he succeeded in leading his people out of bondage in egypt  he led them through great dangers  and they got far enough so that moses could point the way towards freedom on the far banks of the river jordan  and yet  it was not in god's plan to have moses cross the river  instead he would call on joshua to finish the work that moses began  he would ask joshua to take his people that final distance  everyone in this room stands on the shoulders of many moses  they are the courageous men and women who marched and fought and bled for the rights and freedoms we enjoy today  they have taken us many miles over an impossible journey  but you are members of the joshua generation  and it is now up to you to finish the work that they began  it is up to you to cross the river  when joshua discovered the challenge he faced  he had his doubts and his worries  but the lord told joshua not to fear  he said   be strong and have courage  for i am with you wherever you go  those are the words i will leave you with today  be strong and have courage  be strong and have courage in the face of injustice  be strong and have courage in the face of prejudice and hatred  be strong and have courage in the face of joblessness and helplessness and hopelessness  be strong and have courage  in the face of our doubts and fears  in the face of skepticism  in the face of cynicism  in the face of a mighty river  be strong and have courage and let us cross over to that promised land together  congratulations on another year  and thank you so much "], ["obama1", "thank you  ted  ted sorensen has been counselor to a president in some of our toughest moments  and he has helped define our national purpose at pivotal turning points  let me also welcome all of the elected officials from illinois who are with us  let me give a special welcome to all of the organizers and speakers who joined me to rally against going to war in iraq five years ago  and i want to thank depaul university and depaul's students for hosting this event  we come together at a time of renewal for depaul  a new academic year has begun  professors are learning the names of new students  and students are reminded that you actually do have to attend class  that cold is beginning to creep into the chicago air  the season is changing  depaul is now filled with students who have not spent a single day on campus without the reality of a war in iraq  four classes have matriculated and four classes have graduated since this war began  and we are reminded that america's sons and daughters in uniform  and their families  bear the heavy burden  the wife of one soldier from illinois wrote to me and said that her husband  feels like he's stationed in iraq and deploys home  that's a tragic statement  and it could be echoed by families across our country who have seen loved ones deployed to tour after tour of duty  you are students  and the great responsibility of students is to question the world around you  to question things that don't add up  with iraq  we must ask the question  how did we go so wrong  there are those who offer up easy answers  they will assert that iraq is george bush's war  it's all his fault  or that iraq was botched by the arrogance and incompetence of donald rumsfeld and dick cheney  or that we would have gotten iraq right if we went in with more troops  or if we had a different proconsul instead of paul bremer  or if only there were a stronger iraqi prime minister  these are the easy answers  and like most easy answers  they are partially true  but they don't tell the whole truth  because they overlook a harder and more fundamental truth  the hard truth is that the war in iraq is not about a catalog of many mistakes   it is about one big mistake  the war in iraq should never have been fought  five years ago today  i was asked to speak at a rally against going to war in iraq  the vote to authorize the war in congress was less than ten days away and i was a candidate for the united states senate  some friends of mine advised me to keep quiet  going to war in iraq  they pointed out  was popular  all the other major candidates were supporting the war at the time  if the war goes well  they said  you'll have thrown your political career away  but i didn't see how saddam hussein posed an imminent threat  i was convinced that a war would distract us from afghanistan and the real threat from al qaeda  i worried that iraq's history of sectarian rivalry could leave us bogged down in a bloody conflict  and i believed the war would fan the flames of extremism and lead to new terrorism  so i went to the rally  and i argued against a  rash war    a  war based not on reason  but on politics     an occupation of undetermined length  with undetermined costs  and undetermined consequences  i was not alone  though not a majority  millions of americans opposed giving the president the authority to wage war in iraq  twenty three senators  including the leader of the senate intelligence committee  shared my concerns and resisted the march to war  for us  the war defied common sense  after all  the people who hit us on   were in afghanistan  not iraq  but the conventional thinking in washington has a way of buying into stories that make political sense even if they don't make practical sense  we were told that the only way to prevent iraq from getting nuclear weapons was with military force  some leading democrats echoed the administration's erroneous line that there was a connection between saddam hussein and al qaeda  we were counseled by some of the most experienced voices in washington that the only way for democrats to look tough was to talk  act and vote like a republican  as ted sorensen's old boss president kennedy once said    the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war   and frequently the words of the pursuer fall on deaf ears  in the fall of   those deaf ears were in washington  they belonged to a president who didn't tell the whole truth to the american people  who disdained diplomacy and bullied allies  and who squandered our unity and the support of the world after   but it doesn't end there  because the american people weren't just failed by a president   they were failed by much of washington  by a media that too often reported spin instead of facts  by a foreign policy elite that largely boarded the bandwagon for war  and most of all by the majority of a congress   a coequal branch of government   that voted to give the president the open ended authority to wage war that he uses to this day  let's be clear  without that vote  there would be no war  some seek to rewrite history  they argue that they weren't really voting for war  they were voting for inspectors  or for diplomacy  but the congress  the administration  the media  and the american people all understood what we were debating in the fall of   this was a vote about whether or not to go to war  that's the truth as we all understood it then  and as we need to understand it now  and we need to ask those who voted for the war  how can you give the president a blank check and then act surprised when he cashes it  with all that we know about what's gone wrong in iraq  even today's debate is divorced from reality  we've got a surge that is somehow declared a success even though it has failed to enable the political reconciliation that was its stated purpose  the fact that violence today is only as horrific as in   is held up as progress  washington politicians and pundits trip over each other to debate a newspaper advertisement while our troops fight and die in iraq  and the conventional thinking today is just as entrenched as it was in   this is the conventional thinking that measures experience only by the years you've been in washington  not by your time spent serving in the wider world  this is the conventional thinking that has turned against the war  but not against the habits that got us into the war in the first place   the outdated assumptions and the refusal to talk openly to the american people  well i'm not running for president to conform to washington's conventional thinking   i'm running to challenge it  i'm not running to join the kind of washington groupthink that led us to war in iraq   i'm running to change our politics and our policy so we can leave the world a better place than our generation has found it  so there is a choice that has emerged in this campaign  one that the american people need to understand  they should ask themselves  who got the single most important foreign policy decision since the end of the cold war right  and who got it wrong  this is not just a matter of debating the past  it's about who has the best judgment to make the critical decisions of the future  because you might think that washington would learn from iraq  but we've seen in this campaign just how bent out of shape washington gets when you challenge its assumptions  when i said that as president i would lead direct diplomacy with our adversaries  i was called na ve and irresponsible  but how are we going to turn the page on the failed bush cheney policy of not talking to our adversaries if we don't have a president who will lead that diplomacy  when i said that we should take out high level terrorists like osama bin laden if we have actionable intelligence about their whereabouts  i was lectured by legions of iraq war supporters  they said we can't take out bin laden if the country he's hiding in won't  a few weeks later  the co chairmen of the   commission   tom kean and lee hamilton   agreed with my position  but few in washington seemed to notice  some people made a different argument on this issue  they said we can take out bin laden  we just can't say that we will  i reject this  i am a candidate for president of the united states  and i believe that the american people have a right to know where i stand  and when i said that we can rule out the use of nuclear weapons to take out a terrorist training camp  it was immediately branded a  gaffe  because i did not recite the conventional washington speak  but is there any military planner in the world who believes that we need to drop a nuclear bomb on a terrorist training camp  we need to question the world around us  when we have a debate about experience  we can't just debate who has the most experience scoring political points  when we have a debate about experience  we can't just talk about who fought yesterday's battles   we have to focus on who can face the challenges and seize the opportunities of tomorrow  because no matter what we think about george bush  he's going to be gone in january   he's not on the ballot  this election is about ending the iraq war  but even more it's about moving beyond it  and we're not going be safe in a world of unconventional threats with the same old conventional thinking that got us into iraq  we're not going to unify a divided america to confront these threats with the same old conventional politics of just trying to beat the other side  in   we will have a window of opportunity to renew our global leadership and bring our nation together  if we don't seize that moment  we may not get another  this election is a turning point  the american people get to decide  are we going to turn back the clock  or turn the page  i want to be straight with you  if you want conventional washington thinking  i'm not your man  if you want rigid ideology  i'm not your man  if you think that fundamental change can wait  i'm definitely not your man  but if you want to bring this country together  if you want experience that's broader than just learning the ways of washington  if you think that the global challenges we face are too urgent to wait  and if you think that america must offer the world a new and hopeful face  then i offer a different choice in this race and a different vision for our future  the first thing we have to do is end this war  and the right person to end it is someone who had the judgment to oppose it from the beginning  there is no military solution in iraq  and there never was  i will begin to remove our troops from iraq immediately  i will remove one or two brigades a month  and get all of our combat troops out of iraq within   months  the only troops i will keep in iraq will perform the limited missions of protecting our diplomats and carrying out targeted strikes on al qaeda  and i will launch the diplomatic and humanitarian initiatives that are so badly needed  let there be no doubt  i will end this war  but it's also time to learn the lessons of iraq  we're not going to defeat the threats of the  st century on a conventional battlefield  we cannot win a fight for hearts and minds when we outsource critical missions to unaccountable contractors  we're not going to win a battle of ideas with bullets alone  make no mistake  we must always be prepared to use force to protect america  but the best way to keep america safe is not to threaten terrorists with nuclear weapons   it's to keep nuclear weapons and nuclear materials away from terrorists  that's why i've worked with republican senator dick lugar to pass a law accelerating our pursuit of loose nuclear materials  and that's why i'll lead a global effort to secure all loose nuclear materials during my first term in office  but we need to do much more  we need to change our nuclear policy and our posture  which is still focused on deterring the soviet union   a country that doesn't exist  meanwhile  india and pakistan and north korea have joined the club of nuclear armed nations  and iran is knocking on the door  more nuclear weapons and more nuclear armed nations mean more danger to us all  here's what i'll say as president  america seeks a world in which there are no nuclear weapons  we will not pursue unilateral disarmament  as long as nuclear weapons exist  we'll retain a strong nuclear deterrent  but we'll keep our commitment under the nuclear non proliferation treaty on the long road towards eliminating nuclear weapons  we'll work with russia to take u s  and russian ballistic missiles off hair trigger alert  and to dramatically reduce the stockpiles of our nuclear weapons and material  we'll start by seeking a global ban on the production of fissile material for weapons  and we'll set a goal to expand the u s russian ban on intermediate range missiles so that the agreement is global  as we do this  we'll be in a better position to lead the world in enforcing the rules of the road if we firmly abide by those rules  it's time to stop giving countries like iran and north korea an excuse  it's time for america to lead  when i'm president  we'll strengthen the nuclear non proliferation treaty so that nations that don't comply will automatically face strong international sanctions  this will require a new era of american diplomacy  to signal the dawn of that era  we need a president who is willing to talk to all nations  friend and foe  i'm not afraid that america will lose a propaganda battle with a petty tyrant   we need to go before the world and win those battles  if we take the attitude that the president just parachutes in for a photo op after an agreement has already been reached  then we're only going to reach agreements with our friends  that's not the way to protect the american people  that's not the way to advance our interests  just look at our history  kennedy had a direct line to khrushchev  nixon met with mao  carter did the hard work of negotiating the camp david accords  reagan was negotiating arms agreements with gorbachev even as he called on him to  tear down this wall  it's time to make diplomacy a top priority  instead of shuttering consulates  we need to open them in the tough and hopeless corners of the world  instead of having more americans serving in military bands than the diplomatic corps  we need to grow our foreign service  instead of retreating from the world  i will personally lead a new chapter of american engagement  it is time to offer the world a message of hope to counter the prophets of hate  my experience has brought me to the hopeless places  as a boy  i lived in indonesia and played barefoot with children who could not dream the same dreams that i did  as an adult  i've returned to be with my family in their small village in kenya  where the promise of america is still an inspiration  as a community organizer  i worked in south side neighborhoods that had been left behind by global change  as a senator  i've been to refugee camps in chad where proud and dignified people can't hope for anything beyond the next handout  in the  st century  progress must mean more than a vote at the ballot box   it must mean freedom from fear and freedom from want  we cannot stand for the freedom of anarchy  nor can we support the globalization of the empty stomach  we need new approaches to help people to help themselves  the united nations has embraced the millennium development goals  which aim to cut extreme poverty in half by   when i'm president  they will be america's goals  the bush administration tried to keep the un from proclaiming these goals  the obama administration will double foreign assistance to   billion to lead the world to achieve them  in the  st century  we cannot stand up before the world and say that there's one set of rules for america and another for everyone else  to lead the world  we must lead by example  we must be willing to acknowledge our failings  not just trumpet our victories  and when i'm president  we'll reject torture   without exception or equivocation  we'll close guantanamo  we'll be the country that credibly tells the dissidents in the prison camps around the world that america is your voice  america is your dream  america is your light of justice  we cannot   we must not   let the promotion of our values be a casualty of the iraq war  but we cannot secure america and show our best face to the world unless we change how we do business in washington  we all know what iraq has cost us abroad  but these last few years we've seen an unacceptable abuse of power at home  we face real threats  any president needs the latitude to confront them swiftly and surely  but we've paid a heavy price for having a president whose priority is expanding his own power  the constitution is treated like a nuisance  matters of war and peace are used as political tools to bludgeon the other side  we get subjected to endless spin to keep our troops at war  but we don't get to see the flag draped coffins of our heroes coming home  we get secret task forces  secret budgeting  slanted intelligence  and the shameful smearing of people who speak out against the president's policies  all of this has left us where we are today  more divided  more distrusted  more in debt  and mired in an endless war  a war to disarm a dictator has become an open ended occupation of a foreign country  this is not america  this is not who we are  it's time for us to stand up and tell george bush that the government in this country is not based on the whims of one person  the government is of the people  by the people and for the people  we thought we learned this lesson  after vietnam  congress swore it would never again be duped into war  and even wrote a new law   the war powers act   to ensure it would not repeat its mistakes  but no law can force a congress to stand up to the president  no law can make senators read the intelligence that showed the president was overstating the case for war  no law can give congress a backbone if it refuses to stand up as the co equal branch the constitution made it  that is why it is not enough to change parties  it is time to change our politics  we don't need another president who puts politics and loyalty over candor  we don't need another president who thinks big but doesn't feel the need to tell the american people what they think  we don't need another president who shuts the door on the american people when they make policy  the american people are not the problem in this country   they are the answer  and it's time we had a president who acted like that  i will always tell the american people the truth  i will always tell you where i stand  it's what i'm doing in this campaign  it's what i'll do as president  i'll lead a new era of openness  i'll give an annual  state of the world  address to the american people in which i lay out our national security policy  i'll draw on the legacy of one our greatest presidents   franklin roosevelt   and give regular  fireside webcasts  and i'll have members of my national security team do the same  i'll turn the page on a growing empire of classified information  and restore the balance we've lost between the necessarily secret and the necessity of openness in a democratic society by creating a new national declassification center  we'll protect sources and methods  but we won't use sources and methods as pretexts to hide the truth  our history doesn't belong to washington  it belongs to america  i'll use the intelligence that i do receive to make good policy   i won't manipulate it to sell a bad policy  we don't need any more officials who tell the president what they want to hear  i will make the director of national intelligence an official with a fixed term  like the chairman of the federal reserve   not someone who can be fired by the president  we need consistency and integrity at the top of our intelligence agencies  we don't need politics  my test won't be loyalty   it will be the truth  and i'll turn the page on the imperial presidency that treats national security as a partisan issue   not an american issue  i will call for a standing  bipartisan consultative group of congressional leaders on national security  i will meet with this consultative group every month  and consult with them before taking major military action  the buck will stop with me  but these discussions have to take place on a bipartisan basis  and support for these decisions will be stronger if they draw on bipartisan counsel  we're not going to secure this country unless we turn the page on the conventional thinking that says politics is just about beating the other side  it's time to unite america  because we are at an urgent and pivotal moment  there are those who suggest that there are easy answers to the challenges we face  we can look  they say  to washington experience   the same experience that got us into this war  or we can turn the page to something new  to unite this country and to seize this moment  i am not a perfect man and i won't be a perfect president  but my own american story tells me that this country moves forward when we cast off our doubts and seek new beginnings  it's what brought my father across an ocean in search of a dream  it's what i saw in the eyes of men and women and children in indonesia who heard the word   america  and thought of the possibility beyond the horizon  it's what i saw in the streets of the south side  when people who had every reason to give in decided to pick themselves up  it's what i've seen in the united states senate when republicans and democrats of good will do come together to take on tough issues  and it's what i've seen in this campaign  when over half a million americans have come together to seek the change this country needs  now i know that some will shake their heads  it's easy to be cynical  when it comes to our foreign policy  you get it from all sides  some folks on the right will tell you that you don't love your country if you don't support the war in iraq  some folks on the left will tell you that america can do no right in the world  some shrug their shoulders because washington says   trust us  we'll take care of it  and we know happened the last time they said that  yes  it's easy to be cynical  but right now  somewhere in iraq  there's someone about your age  he's maybe on his second or third tour  it's hot  he would rather be at home  but he's in his uniform  got his combat gear on  he's getting in a humvee  he's going out on patrol  he's lost a buddy in this war  maybe more  he risked his life yesterday  he's risking his life today  and he's going to risk it tomorrow  so why do we reject the cynicism  we reject it because of men and women like him  we reject it because the legacy of their sacrifice must be a better america  we reject it because they embody the spirit of those who fought to free the slaves and free a continent from a madman  who rebuilt europe and sent peace corps volunteers around the globe  because they are fighting for a better america and a better world  and i reject it because i wouldn't be on this stage if  throughout our history  america had not made the right choice over the easy choice  the ambitious choice over the cautious choice  i wouldn't be here if i didn't think we were ready to move past the fights of the  s and the  s  i wouldn't be here if  time and again  the torch had not been passed to a new generation   to unite this country at home  to show a new face of this country to the world  i'm running for the presidency of the united states of america so that together we can do the hard work to seek a new dawn of peace and prosperity for our children  and for the children of the world "], ["obama1", "two weeks ago  representatives from some of the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases were invited to washington by the president for a global conference on climate change  for a brief moment  there was a hope that maybe this conference would be different   that maybe america would finally commit to the steps that nearly every scientist and expert believes we must take  that maybe the planet's only superpower would finally lead the world   or at the very least  follow it   in taking on the planet's greatest threat  instead  the world traveled thousands of miles to washington only to find that washington is still miles away from the world in its willingness to address one of the most urgent challenges of our generation  some of the attendees said they were amazed at how isolated the white house view had become  others dismissed the president's credibility entirely  and another headline noted that when it comes to the global debate on climate change  our country is struggling just to stay relevant  struggling just to stay relevant  that is not the america we know  it is not the america we believe in  we are a nation that has led the world ever since the moment a lowly band of colonists proved that freedom could triumph over tyranny  we are the country that summoned the courage of its people to build an arsenal of democracy that freed a continent and brought peace to a world at war  we are a land of moon shots and miracles of science and technology that have touched the lives of millions across the planet  and when that planet is challenged or when it is threatened  the eyes of the world have always turned to this nation as the  last  best hope of earth  that is the america i want to lead as president  i believe that when it comes to the issue that will determine the very future of life on this earth  we are still earth's best hope  and when the world arrives at the doorstep of the white house to hear what america has to say about climate change  i will let them know that america is up to the challenge  that america is ready to lead again  we have not fallen behind on energy due to a lack of ingenuity or initiative from the american people  i have seen too much innovation and possibility in this country to believe that  right here in new hampshire  i've filled up at a biodiesel pump at unh  where this year students and faculty will remove over   tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  new hampshire is already reducing its greenhouse gas pollution as part of the regional greenhouse gas initiative  and thanks to the leadership of senator martha fuller clark and governor lynch  you'll get   of your energy from renewable sources by   keene is one of america's greenest cities  and i understand that   towns have now passed a resolution demanding that washington take action on climate change but washington hasn't acted  and that is the real reason why america hasn't led  washington's failure to lead on energy is the failure of a president who spent most of his time in office denying the very existence of global warming   a president who put more faith in the spin of a science fiction writer than the science facts of real experts  it's the failure of an administration that developed america's energy policy with a secret task force that opened the door to oil lobbyists and then shut it to every other viewpoint  it's a failure of leadership that has never called on the american people to do anything more than go shopping  and it's also a failure of our politics that pre dates the presidency of george w  bush  we have heard promises about energy independence from every single u s  president since richard nixon   republicans and democrats  we've heard proposals to curb our use of fossil fuels in nearly every state of the union address since the oil embargo of   back then we imported about a third of our oil  now we import over half  back then global warming was just the theory of a few scientists  now it is a fact that threatens our very existence  the truth is  our energy problem has become an energy crisis because no matter how well intentioned the promise   no matter how bold the proposal   they all fall victim to the same washington politics that has only become more divided and dishonest  more timid and calculating  more beholden to the powerful interests that have the biggest stake in the status quo  there are some in this race who actually make the argument that the more time you spend immersed in the broken politics of washington  the more likely you are to change it  i always find this a little amusing  i know that change makes for good campaign rhetoric  but when these same people had the chance to actually make change happen  they didn't lead  when they had the chance to stand up and require automakers to raise their fuel standards  they refused  when they had multiple chances to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by investing in renewable fuels that we can literally grow right here in america  they said no  now  i know that some of these policies are difficult politically  they aren't easy  but being president of the united states isn't about doing what's easy  it's about doing what's hard  it's about doing what's right  leadership isn't about telling people what they want to hear   it's about telling them what they need to hear  when i arrived in the u s  senate  i wanted to do whatever i could to make real progress toward energy independence  i reached across the aisle to pass a law that will give more americans the chance to fill up their cars with clean biofuels  i passed a law that will fuel the research needed to develop a car that will get   miles to the gallon  i even voted for an energy bill that was far from perfect because i was able to ensure that it contained some real investments in renewable sources of energy  and i've fought to eliminate the tax giveaways to oil companies that were slipped into that bill   oil companies that have spent half a billion dollars lobbying congress in the last ten years while their profits have risen to record highs  and i did something else  i knew that america hadn't raised the fuel standards for our cars in twenty years  even though we had the technology on the shelf  even though japanese car companies that make more fuel efficient cars are running circles around our own car companies  even though we send hundreds of millions of dollars a day to some of the world's most dangerous regimes for their oil  so i decided to try something new  i reached across the aisle to come up with a plan to raise our fuel standards that won support of lawmakers who had never supported raising fuel standards before  and i didn't just give a speech about it in front of some environmental audience in california  i went to detroit  i stood in front of a group of automakers  and i told them that when i am president  there will be no more excuses   we will help them retool their factories  but they will have to make cars that use less oil  now i have to admit   the room was pretty quiet after that  but i said what i did because i believe america has had enough of politicians who just tell everyone what they want to hear  we have to tell people the truth  and the truth is that we can't afford to let the same old politics stand in the way of our future anymore  we can't afford the same kind of caution when the future of our security is at stake  we know that the money that america spends on foreign oil is funding both sides of the war on terror  that it pays for everything from the madrassas that plant the seeds of terror in young minds to the sunni insurgents that attack our troops in iraq  we know this money corrupts budding democracies and allows dictators from hostile regimes to threaten the international community  it even presents a target for osama bin laden  who has told al qaeda to   focus your operations on oil  since this will cause  the americans  to die off on their own  we can't be afraid to stand up to the oil and auto industry when the future of our economy is at stake  when we let these companies off the hook  when we tell them they don't have to build fuel efficient cars or transition to renewable fuels  it may boost their short term profits  but it is killing their long term chances for survival and threatening too many american jobs  the global market is already moving away from fossil fuels  the question is not if a renewable energy economy will thrive in the future  it's where  and if we want that place to be the united states of america  we can't afford to wait any longer  most of all  we cannot afford more of the same timid politics when the future of our planet is at stake  global warming is not a someday problem  it is now  in a state like new hampshire  the ski industry is facing shorter seasons and losing jobs  we are already breaking records with the intensity of our storms  the number of forest fires  the periods of drought  by   famine could force more than   million from their homes   famine that will increase the chances of war and strife in many of the world's weakest states  the polar ice caps are now melting faster than science had ever predicted  and if we do nothing  sea levels will rise high enough to swallow large portions of every coastal city and town  this is not the future i want for my daughters  it's not the future any of us want for our children  and if we act now and we act boldly  it doesn't have to be  but if we wait  if we let campaign promises and state of the union pledges go unanswered for yet another year  if we let the same broken politics that's held us back for decades win one more time  we will lose another chance to save our planet  and we might not get many more  i reject that future  i would not be running for president if i didn't believe that this time could be different  not because i have some perfect solution that every other expert and candidate has somehow missed  not because i think i can lock myself in the white house with a secret task force and get this done on my own  but because i believe the american people are ready for a president who can unite us around a common purpose again  i believe that we are ready to lead again  make no mistake   developing the next generation of energy will be one of the greatest challenges that this generation of americans will ever face  it will not be easy  it will not come without cost or without sacrifice  and if anyone tries to tell you otherwise  they are either fooling themselves or trying to fool you  i will set big goals for this country as president   some so large that the technology to reach them does not yet exist  but that has not stopped us before  when president roosevelt's advisors informed him that his goals for wartime production were impossible to meet  he waved them off and said  believe me  the production people can do it if they really try  and they did  when the scientists and engineers told john f  kennedy that they had no idea how to put a man on the moon  he told them they would find a way  and we found one  i believe we will again  in the speech i gave in detroit  i laid out the first part of my comprehensive energy plan   a proposal that will require our cars to use less oil and our fuels to use less carbon  it's a proposal that alone removes   million cars' worth of pollution from the road and reduces our oil consumption   million barrels a day by     the equivalent of all the oil we import from the persian gulf today  today i want to lay out the second part of my plan   a set of proposals that will allow america to lead the world in combating global climate change  from the moment i take office as president  i will call together scientists and entrepreneurs  heads of industry and labor  democrats  republicans and americans from all walks of life to help develop and deploy the next generation of energy that will allow us to build the next generation's economy  after all  in meeting the challenges of earlier generations  we didn't just end a costly war or beat the soviets to the moon   we also unleashed opportunities we had never dreamed of  the gi bill sent an entire generation of americans   including my grandfather   to college and then on to the middle class  legions of scientists and engineers emerged from our race to space whose discoveries and innovations have forever changed the world  this same opportunity exists today  that's why my plan isn't just about making dirty energy expensive  it's about making clean energy affordable   a project that will create millions of new jobs and entire new industries right here in america  the first step in doing this is to phase out a carbon based economy that's causing our changing climate  as president  i will set a hard cap on all carbon emissions at a level that scientists say is necessary to curb global warming   an   reduction by   to ensure this isn't just talk  i will also commit to interim targets toward this goal in     and   these reductions will start immediately  and we'll continue to follow the recommendations of top scientists to ensure that our targets are strong enough to meet the challenge we face  in addition to this cap  all polluters will have to pay based on the amount of pollution they release into the sky  the market will set the price  but unlike the other cap and trade proposals that have been offered in this race  no business will be allowed to emit any greenhouses gases for free  businesses don't own the sky  the public does  and if we want them to stop polluting it  we have to put a price on all pollution  it's time to make the cleaner way of doing business the more profitable way of doing business  there is no doubt that this transition will be costly in the short term  to make it easier  we will provide assistance to americans who need help with their energy bills  we'll help families make their homes more energy efficient  and we'll help workers and factories retool their facilities so they can compete and thrive in a clean energy economy  and once we make america more energy efficient and start producing more renewable energy  we will save money and bring energy costs down in the long run  but we must act now  once we make dirty energy expensive  the second step in my plan is to invest   billion over the next decade to ensure the development and deployment of clean  affordable energy  that starts with the next generation of biofuels  we know that corn ethanol has been the most successful alternative fuel we have ever developed  i've been a champion for ethanol  in just two years  the renewable fuel standard i helped pass has sparked an historic expansion of ethanol production  it has helped displace foreign oil and strengthen our rural economy  and we should fight the efforts of big oil and big agri business to undermine this emerging industry  but the truth is  corn ethanol is neither the perfect nor the permanent answer to our energy challenge  there are legitimate economic and ecological concerns about an over reliance on corn based ethanol  and even if we double or triple its production  it won't replace even a tenth of our demand for gasoline  that's why we must invest in the next generation of advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol that can be made from things like switchgrass and woodchips  the struggling paper mills in new hampsire would be back in business if they could use wood to produce biofuels  we should set a goal to produce the first two billion gallons of advanced biofuels by   and we should make sure that more local farms and local refineries have the chance to be a part of this new industry  we'll also invest in clean energy sources like wind power and solar power  so that by   america can meet a new standard that will require   of all our electricity to come from renewable sources  and we must find a way to stop coal from polluting our atmosphere without pretending that our nation's most abundant energy source will just go away  it won't  it will also require taking steps to ensure that china's coal emissions are curbed as well  already  some coal pollution from china's dirty plants is making its way to california  that's why we must invest in clean coal technologies that we can use at home and share with the world  until those technologies are available  i will rely on the carbon cap and whatever tools are necessary to stop new dirty coal plants from being built in america   including a ban on new traditional coal facilities  we will also explore safer ways to use nuclear power  which right now accounts for more than   of our non carbon generated electricity  we should accelerate research into technologies that will allow for the safe  secure treatment of nuclear waste  as president  i'll continue the work i began in the senate to ensure that all nuclear material is stored  secured and accounted for   both at home and around the world  there should be no short cuts or regulatory loopholes   period  many of these clean energy technologies   from biofuels to solar power to carbon sequestration   are being developed in research labs and facilities all across america at this very moment  the problem is they might never get further than that  u s  venture capital funding does a great job investing in research and development  but we don't do enough to take the risk out of bringing new discoveries to the wider marketplace  and so we see technologies that are invented here in america   like wind turbines  solar panels  and compact fluorescent bulbs   developed overseas and then sold back to american consumers  this will change when i am president  i will launch a clean technologies venture capital fund that will provide   billion a year for five years to get the most promising clean energy technologies off the ground  this venture capital fund will get new technologies from the lab to the marketplace so that in the next few years  the american economy can benefit from america's innovations  the third step in my plan to combat climate change is to call on businesses  government  and the american people to make america   more energy efficient by   this is by far the fastest  easiest  and cheapest way to curb our emissions and save money at the same time  since dupont implemented an energy efficiency program in   the company has significantly reduced its pollution and cut its energy bills by   billion  and cities like keene and portland  oregon have led in meeting new efficiency standards  there is no reason the rest of america can't do the same  we will start by dramatically improving the efficiency of our buildings  which currently account for nearly half of all carbon emissions in america today  when i am president  we'll set a goal of making our new buildings   more efficient within several years  the federal government will lead by making all of its buildings carbon neutral by   and i will set a national goal of making all new buildings in america carbon neutral by   we will also start replacing our outdated power grid with a digital smart grid so that we don't lose precious energy and billions of dollars like we did in the   new york city blackout  we'll follow the lead of states like california and change the way utilities make money so that their profits aren't tied to how much energy we use  but how much energy we save  finally  we know that if every home in america replaced just five incandescent light bulbs with five compact fluorescent bulbs  it would eliminate the need for twenty one power plants  we'll do one better  i will immediately sign a law that begins to phase out all incandescent light bulbs   a measure that will save american consumers   billion a year on their electric bills  now  none of these steps will happen overnight  they will take time  they will take sacrifice  and they will take a sustained commitment from the american people  as president  i will lead this commitment  i will not be outlining these goals in my state of the union and then walk away when they become too difficult  i will report to the american people every year on the state of our energy future  and let you know the progress we've made toward an   emissions reduction by   toward replacing over a third of our oil consumption by   and toward improving our energy efficiency   by   i will also make america's energy security a fundamental tenet of our national security by preparing our military to deal with threats posed by climate change  and there is one step i will take as soon as possible  from the moment i take office  i will invite the world back to washington and let it be known that the united states of america is ready to lead again  that we are ready to rejoin the community of nations in taking on the greatest challenge of this generation  i will personally reach out to the leaders of the biggest carbon emitting nations in both the developed and developing world and ask them to join america in creating a new global energy forum that will lay the foundation for the next generation of climate protocols  it will complement   and ultimately merge with   the much larger negotiation process underway at the un to develop a post kyoto framework  i will be in constant contact with these leaders to develop concrete  feasible emissions targets that all of us will meet  we will also work to build an alliance of oil importing nations and work together to reduce our demand  just like the opec nations strategize on supply  and as we develop new forms of clean energy here at home  we will share our technology and our innovations with all the nations of the world  if we can build a clean coal plant in america  china should be able to as well  if we find a way to harness the next generation of biofuels  india will know how to do it too  and as we tackle under development in impoverished nations  we will use what we know to help them reduce the negative impacts of climate change and build a clean energy future  recently  the director of a nonprofit that helps promote clean energy policies in china said that the most frequent question he gets from the chinese about every policy initiative he suggests is   if it is so good  why aren't you doing it  and it's the hardest question to answer  he said   we can point to good examples that some american states  or cities  or companies are implementing but we can't point to america  i believe it's time the world could point to america again  i want the engineer in new delhi to point to our green buildings as the kind he'd like to design for his country  i want the automaker in tokyo to point to our cars as the model for all the world  i want the leaders of europe and asia  of africa and south america to point to our diplomacy and our engagement and our ingenuity as the light that led us toward a new energy future in our time  and most of all  i want our children and our children's children to point to this generation and this moment as the time when america found its way again  as the time when america overcame the division and the politics and the pettiness of an earlier era so that a new generation could come together and take on the most urgent challenge of this era  i am running for president of the united states to lead us toward this new era  and i ask all of you to join me in taking on the challenge that lies ahead  thank you "], ["obama1", "let me start by congratulating a great american  al gore  for being named this year's winner of the nobel peace prize  vice president gore has been an extraordinary leader for this country  through his many years of public service  his early and vocal opposition to the war in iraq  and   above all   his singular leadership in drawing attention to the global climate crisis  al gore has advanced the cause of peace at home and around the world  this award is richly deserved  you know  it was five years ago yesterday that the united states senate voted to give president bush the authority to wage war in iraq  at the time  i was a candidate for the u s  senate and i spoke out strongly in opposition to going to war  nearly all of my opponents for the democratic nomination for president made a different choice  and voted to authorize the war  now  some have asked me   why are you always reminding us that you opposed the war  isn't that yesterday's news  is that experience really relevant  and what i always say is this   this isn't just about the past  it's about the future  i don't talk about my opposition to the war to say  i told you so  i wish the war had gone differently  but the reason i talk about it is because i truly believe that the judgment  and the conviction  and the accountability that each of us showed on the most important foreign policy decision of our lives is the best indicator you have of how each of us will make those decisions going forward  how we made that decision  and how we talk about it  is critical to understanding what we would do as president  will we carefully evaluate the evidence and the consequences of action  or will we skip over the intelligence and scare people with the consequences of inaction  will we make these decisions based on polls  or based on our principles  will we have the courage to make the tough choice  or will we just choose the course that makes us look tough  these decisions aren't just washington parlor games about who's up and who's down  these are life and death decisions  they impact your safety and security  above all  they impact the soldier from iowa  or the airman from illinois  and every single one of our brave young men and women who are in harm's way  and all of their families and friends back home  now  it's easy to oppose a war after it has gone wrong  it's easy to say   years later   that the war shouldn't have happened  given what we know now about how badly it has turned out  but every single one of us running for president only had one chance to make a judgment about whether or not to go to war  as i travel around the country  so many americans ask me  how did we go so wrong in iraq  and they're not just asking because they want to understand the past   they're asking because they don't want their leaders to make the same mistakes again in the future  they don't want leaders who will bog us down in unnecessary wars  they don't want leaders who allow america to lose its standing  and they don't want leaders who tell the american people anything less than the full truth about where they stand and what they'll do  that is a big part of what this campaign is about  because we need to learn the painful lessons of the iraq war if we're going to secure this country and renew america's leadership  the first thing we have to understand is what happened in iraq  because there are two ways to look at this  the first way is to say that iraq is a disaster because of george bush's mismanagement  or because of the arrogance and incompetence of dick cheney or donald rumsfeld in prosecuting the war  or because iraq's prime minister just hasn't been up to the job  but i take a different view  i think the problem isn't just  em how em  we've fought the war   it's that we fought the war in the first place  because the truth is  the war in iraq should never have been authorized  and it should never have been waged  the iraq war had nothing to do with al qaeda or   it was based on exaggerated fears and unconvincing intelligence  and it has left america less safe  and less respected around the world  five years ago  my friends warned me not to speak up against the war  going to war was popular  so was president bush  you'll be putting your political career on the line  they said  but i just didn't see how saddam hussein posed an imminent threat  i was convinced that a war would distract us from afghanistan and al qaeda  and fan the flames of extremism and terrorism  and i didn't get into politics to stay silent on the tough issues  or to tailor my positions to the polls  i didn't want to look back  after an unnecessary war had been waged  and regret that i didn't speak out against going to war just because going to war was popular  so i spoke out against what i called a  rash war    a  war based not on reason but on politics    but the conventional thinking in washington lined up for war  the president and his advisors told us that the only way to stop saddam hussein from getting a nuclear weapon was to go to war  that we couldn't let the smoking gun be a mushroom cloud  leading democrats   including senator clinton   echoed the erroneous line that there was a connection between saddam hussein and al qaeda  we were counseled by some of the most experienced voices in washington that the only way for democrats to look tough was to talk  act  and vote like republicans  there is no doubt that president bush failed us in the run up to war  but the american people weren't just failed by the president   they were failed by the congress  too many members of congress failed to ask hard questions  too many members of congress  including some of my opponents in this race  failed to read the national intelligence estimate for themselves   an intelligence report that was so unconvincing  and so filled with qualifications  that the chairman of the senate intelligence committee decided to vote against the war when he read it for himself  too many democrats fell in line with george bush  and voted to give him the open ended authority to wage war that he uses to this day  so let's be clear  without that vote  there would be no war  senator edwards voted for the war in   he has renounced that vote  instead of pretending that it was a vote for anything but war  but senator clinton makes a different argument  she says that she wasn't really voting for war back in   she was voting for more inspections  or she was voting for more diplomacy  but all of us know what was being debated in the congress in the fall of   we didn't need to authorize a war in order to have united nations weapons inspections  no one thought congress was debating whether or not to conduct diplomacy  the headlines on october     did not read   congress authorizes diplomacy with iraq    the headlines on october     read  congress backs war  in the course of this campaign  we haven't just seen different candidates talk about their vote in different ways   we've seen how different candidates have drawn different lessons from their experience of the iraq war  five years later  we should all have learned the lessons of that vote   we should all have learned that you can't give this administration an excuse to wage war  but just last month  the senate voted for an amendment that raises the risk that we could repeat the mistake of iraq  here is why this amendment is so reckless  it opens with seventeen findings that highlight iran's influence inside of iraq  then it says we have to structure our military presence inside iraq to counter iran  it goes on to say that it is  a critical national interest of the united states  to prevent the iranian government from exerting influence inside iraq  why is this amendment so dangerous  because george bush and dick cheney could use this language to justify keeping our troops in iraq as long as they can point to a threat from iran  and because they could use this language to justify an attack on iran as a part of the ongoing war in iraq  i don't want to give this president any excuse  or any opening for war  because as we learned with the authorization of the iraq war   when you give this president a blank check  you can't be surprised when he cashes it  senator clinton is the only democratic candidate for president who supports this amendment  she said  like she did five years ago  that it is a way to support diplomacy  i disagree  we all know that iran poses a threat  we do need to mount international pressure to stop iran's nuclear program  we do need to tighten sanctions on the iranian regime   particularly on iran's revolutionary guard  which supports terrorism  but this must be done separately from any saber rattling about checking iranian influence with our military presence in iraq  we should not be arguing that our troops have to stay in iraq to counter iran  now is the time to end the war in iraq  now is the time to start bringing our troops out of iraq   immediately  that's why i have a plan to remove one or two combat brigades a month so that we get all of our combat troops out of iraq within   months   that's as quickly and responsibly as we can do this  the only troops i will keep in iraq for a limited time will protect our diplomats and carry out targeted strikes on al qaeda   not sustained combat  and i will launch the diplomatic and humanitarian initiatives that are so badly needed  so let there be no doubt  i will end this war  now is not the time to give george bush and dick cheney any excuse to escalate this war  now is not the time for the congress to send mixed messages  that's why my position today is the same as it was when i stood up in iowa on september   and said   george bush and dick cheney must hear   loud and clear   from the american people and the congress  you don't have our support  and you don't have our authorization for another war  five years after that vote for war  we should all have learned the lesson that the cowboy diplomacy of not talking to people we don't like doesn't work  we do need tougher diplomacy with iran  but the way to support tough diplomacy is not to vote for reckless amendments   the way to support diplomacy is to actually pursue it  that's what i've called for throughout this campaign   direct diplomacy  without preconditions  and that's what i'll do as president  not the bush cheney diplomacy of talking to our friends and ignoring our enemies  real  direct  and sustained diplomacy  a couple of months ago  senator clinton called me  na ve and irresponsible  for taking this position  and said that we could lose propaganda battles if we met with leaders we didn't like  just yesterday  though  she called for diplomacy with iran without preconditions  so i'm not sure if any of us knows exactly where she stands on this  but i can tell you this  when i am president of the united states  the american people and the world will always know where i stand  i don't see how we can rally the world unless we have a president who is willing to lead  i'm not afraid that america will lose a propaganda battle with a petty tyrant   we need to go before the world and win those battles  and as president  i will  you know  the cautious  conventional thinking in washington says that democrats can't take these positions  or that we need to say one thing in a caucus and primary campaign  but another in a general election  this is the conventional thinking that said that democrats had to vote for war in   because there was an election coming up   an election that we lost  the conventional thinking that says that democrats can't win elections  unless they talk  act and vote like republicans when it comes to foreign policy and national security  well  i'm not running to conform to washington's conventional thinking   i'm running to challenge it  that's what i did in   that's what i did in   and that's what i will do as president of the united states  because i think the pundits have it wrong  i think the american people have had enough of politicians who go out of their way to look tough  who say one thing in a caucus and another in a general election  when i am the nominee of our party  the choice will be clear  my republican opponent won't be able to say that we both supported this war in iraq  he won't be able to say that we really agree about using the war in iraq to justify military action against iran  or about the diplomacy of not talking and saber rattling  he won't be able to say that i haven't been open and straight with the american people  or that i've changed my positions  and you know what  the american people want that choice  because i believe that's what we need in our next president  we've had enough of a misguided war in iraq that never should have been fought   a war that needs to end  we've had enough of presidents who put tough talk ahead of real diplomacy  and we've had enough of politicians who put power over principle  of a government in washington that shuts you out  and of presidents who don't hold themselves accountable  this is about what we stand for as democrats  but much more than that   it's about what we stand for as americans  because there are plenty of democrats and plenty of independents and  yes  plenty of republicans out there who are ready to turn the page on the broken politics and blustering foreign policy coming from washington  that's how we're going to bring this country together  that's how we're going to restore our security and renew our standing in the world  not by shifting with the political winds  but by standing strong in any storm  and standing up for what we believe  i would not be on this stage today if the promise of america had not brought my father across an ocean  i would not be on this stage if generations of americans had not fought before me so that the american dream could be extended to a man named barack obama  that's why i have spent my own life fighting for that dream  no matter how difficult it's been  no matter how tough it was to take a stand  that's why i will always tell you where i stand and what i believe  and when i am president  that is how we will meet the hard challenges  and reclaim that dream  and make the united states of america a light to the world once more "], ["obama1", "it's a special honor to be here in clarendon county  because clarendon county is the place that showed me and showed america that when ordinary people come together  they can do extraordinary things  that's the clarendon county i know  i know how sixty years ago  the naacp's james hinton dared to ask why white children could ride buses to school but black children had to walk  i know how reverend j a  delaine  a preacher and teacher in summerton  heard that call and joined with levi pearson  a father who was sick and tired of seeing his children walk nine miles to school  and with harry and eliza briggs and more than a dozen other black parents to challenge unequal education  i know that because of that challenge  harry briggs lost his job at the local service station  eliza briggs lost hers at a local hotel  and reverend delaine's home was burned to the ground while the fire department stood by and watched  it would have been easy for them to stay home  to heed the voices of caution and convenience that said   wait   the timing isn't right  or  the country just isn't ready  it would have been easy for them to give in to the fears that no doubt kept them awake some nights  but i know that because they were willing to overcome their fears and reach for a larger dream  the supreme court overturned  separate but equal  and congress passed the civil rights act and the voting rights act and i know that i stand on their shoulders  that their courage and sacrifice six decades ago makes it possible for me to run today for president of the united states  so i know clarendon county  the clarendon county that showed a nation how to look up rather than down  the clarendon county that made a claim on the american dream  the clarendon county that changed the course of history  but i also know another clarendon county  i know schools in the corridor of shame  i know j v  martin junior high school in dillon was built more than a century ago  and for years had shattered windows  leaking ceilings  and broken bathrooms  i know south carolina has the worst high school dropout rate in america  i know that all across this nation  one out of every four children go to schools just like j  v  martin  and take away the same message that we don't care enough about their education to do better by them  i know that america today is still blind to the poverty in our midst  and that we still tolerate jena justice for some and scooter libby justice for others  i know that black parents in clarendon are still having to go to court to give their children an equal education   fifty years after brown v  board of education  there is another side of clarendon county  another side of america  still waiting for what harry and eliza briggs hoped for  the hope that our children's destinies aren't written before they are born  the hope that one day the world as it is and the world as it should be might be one and the same  that is why i stand before you today as a candidate for president of the united states of america  i am running because i refuse to accept that the way it is  is the way it has to be  i refuse to accept it when i hear adults say things like  these kids can't learn  or  these kids come from tough backgrounds  or  these kids are too far behind  we need to start treating  these kids  like  our kids  i am running because i want a sense of urgency about our kids in washington  when i'm in the white house  we'll reform no child left behind so we don't leave the money behind  we'll recruit an army of new teachers   and make sure they come teach here in manning   because the most important factor in a child's education is the person standing at the head of the classroom  we'll invest in early childhood education because for every dollar we put there  we get seven dollars back in reduced dropout rates  reduced delinquency  and reduced prison rates  and more young people can go to college and get good jobs  and we'll rebuild our broken schools  we know why this matters  it's not just that a good education is essential to helping the children of today compete more effectively as the workers of tomorrow  it's that the promise of a good education makes it possible for every child to transcend the barriers of race and class and background and achieve their god given potential  that's why harry and eliza briggs put their names on that lawsuit  that's why so many others risked so much to give their children an equal education  that's my story  that's what the american story is supposed to be about  that cause is worth fighting for  a quality education is worth fighting for  universal health care is worth fighting for  economic opportunity is worth fighting for  equality is still worth fighting for  and when i'm president  we're going to have a government that helps us win these fights  not because it's up to me alone  not because i have a corner on all the best ideas  but because i understand that we need more than a new campaign or candidate   we need a movement  we need a president ready to partner with you and not too important to do so  ready to move the american people to common cause on these issues  and willing to ask you to do your part   not just as voters  but as citizens  because the truth is  no matter how many government programs we launch or how many tax dollars we spend  we can still fall short if each of us is unwilling to do our own part  if we're unwilling to be responsible parents and turn off the tv  put away the video games  read to our child  and attend those parent teacher conferences  we can still fall short if we don't heal the hole in the hearts of all those young men standing on street corners in every city in this country without a sense of any destiny other than ending up in jail or dead  and healing that hole is going to take more than a change in policy  it's going to take a change of heart  we're going to have to reclaim in our own lives the belief that i am my brother's keeper  i am my sister's keeper  it's the belief that led folks in clarendon not to turn their backs on harry briggs and his fellow foot soldiers  but to offer them money when their credit was cut at the local store  and a place to stay when they were kicked off the land  it's the belief that led a white judge named j  waites waring to stand by their side even after a cross was burned on his lawn and shots were fired into his living room  and it's the belief that led me into public service more than two decades ago  as some of you may know  after college  i walked away from a career on wall street  and went to work with a group of churches as a community organizer on the south side of chicago so i could fight for folks who had lost their jobs when the local steel plant closed  and ever since  i've been fighting to put the american dream within reach for every american  that's why i went to work as a civil rights lawyer  and as a state senator and as a u s  senator  that's why i expanded health care to   children and their parents in illinois  that's why i led the fight to reform a death penalty system that had sentenced   innocent men to death  that's why i led the fight to reform racial profiling  and that's why you can trust that i'll fight for you as president  now  i've heard that some folks aren't sure america is ready for an african american president  so let me be clear  i never would have begun this campaign if i weren't confident i could win  but you see  i am not asking anyone to take a chance on me  i am asking you to take a chance on your own aspirations  just imagine what we could do as partners in an obama administration  imagine a president who was raised like i was by a single mom who had to work and go to school and raise her kids and accept food stamps for a while  imagine a president who could go into holly courts apartments here in manning or scott's branch high school in summerton  and give the young men and women there someone to look up to  imagine a president who fought each day to narrow the gap between the world as it is and the world as it should be  narrowing that gap is not going to be easy  but real change never is  i can still remember one of the early days when i was just starting out as a community organizer in chicago  we had set up a meeting to figure out how to rebuild our neighborhoods  but no one showed up  and our volunteers felt so defeated  they wanted to quit  and i was tired too  but at that moment  i looked outside and saw some young boys playing in a vacant lot across the street  tossing stones at a boarded up apartment building  and i turned to the volunteers  and i asked them   before you quit  i want you to answer one question  what's gonna happen to those boys  i thought  if we cannot put aside our doubts and our cynicism  if we cannot see that we have a stake in those children  if we don't realize that the fight for their future is the fight for our own  who will  one by one  the volunteers decided to stay  and block by block  we began to turn those neighborhoods around  so today  sixty years after james hinton issued his challenge  i want to issue a challenge of my own  if you're tired of the politics of fear and division  if you're tired of a government that stands idly by while our schools go underfunded  our children go unemployed  and our communities are neglected  if you feel as i do that if we don't fight for that next generation of children  who will    then i'm asking you to join me  and if you can do that   if you can overcome your doubts  cast away your fears  and believe once again that real change is possible in this country   then i truly believe we can bring about the world that harry and eliza briggs dreamed of for their children "], ["obama1", "one year from now  you will have the chance to walk into a voting booth  pull back the curtain  and choose the next president of the united states  here's the good news   for the first time in a long time  the name george bush will not appear on the ballot  the name dick cheney will not appear on the ballot  the era of scooter libby justice  and brownie incompetence  and the karl rove politics of fear and cynicism will be over  but the question you will have to ask yourselves when you pick up your ballot a year from today is   what next  how do we repair the enormous damage of these dismal years and recapture that sense of common purpose that has seen america through our toughest times  i'm running for president because i believe we find ourselves in a moment of great challenge and great promise   a moment that comes along once in a generation  it's a moment of challenge because america is less safe and less respected than at any time in recent history  we are more dependent on oil from dictators and closer to the day when climate change becomes a climate catastrophe  in the midst of great prosperity  families all across this country feel further from the american dream  you know this from your own lives  most americans are working harder for less and paying more for health care and college than ever before  it's harder to save  harder to retire  and the policies of the last seven years have added to that unfairness  george bush said whatever the politics of the moment required in order to get elected in   and those seven years of broken promises have left the american people with less trust in their leaders and less faith in their government than they have in years  we were promised compassion and conservatism but we got katrina and wiretaps  we were promised a uniter  but we got a divider who couldn't even lead the half of the country who voted for him  we were promised a kinder  gentler washington but got a town that's more bitter  secretive  and corrupt than ever before  and the only mission ever accomplished was using fear and falsehoods to take us to a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged  this catastrophic failure of leadership has led us to a moment where it's not just democrats who are listening to what we have to say  but independents and republicans who have never been more disillusioned with what the state of our leadership in washington has done to this country  that's why this is also a moment of great promise  it's a chance to turn the page by offering the american people a fundamentally different choice in     not just in the policies we offer  but in the kind of leadership we offer  it's a chance to come together and finally solve the challenges that were made worse by george bush  but existed long before he took office   challenges like health care and energy and education that we haven't met for decades because of a political system in washington that has failed the american people  and that's what this debate in our party right now is all about  much has been said about the exchanges between senator clinton and myself this week  now  understand that hillary clinton is a colleague and a friend  she's also a skilled politician  and she's run what washington would call a  textbook  campaign  but the problem is the textbook itself  it's a textbook that's all about winning elections  but says nothing about how to bring the country together to solve problems  as we saw in the debate last week  it encourages vague  calculated answers to suit the politics of the moment  instead of clear  consistent principles about how you would lead america  it teaches you that you can promise progress for everyday people while striking a bargain with the very special interests who crowd them out  now  senator clinton is certainly not the only one in washington to play this game  it's gone on for years  and i understand the reasoning behind it  it's a game that usually gets politicians where they need to go  but i don't believe it gets america where we need to go  when it comes to issues like war and diplomacy  energy and health care  i don't believe we can bring about real change if all we do is change our positions based on what's popular or politically convenient  if we are going to seize this moment of challenge and promise  the american people deserve more when they head to the voting booth in   i believe that our party has made the most difference in people's lives and the life of this country when we have led not by polls but by principle  not by calculation but by conviction  when we've been able to summon the entire nation to a common purpose   a higher purpose  that's how roosevelt led us through war and lifted us from depression  it's how kennedy called on a new generation to ask what they could do for america  and i am running for the democratic nomination for president of the united states because that's the kind of leadership america needs right now  i don't pretend to be a perfect man  and i will not be a perfect president  but i am in this race because i believe that if we want to break from the failures of the past and finally make progress as a country  we can't keep telling different people what we think they want to hear   we have to tell every american what they need to know  we have to be honest about the challenges we face  when i called for higher fuel standards so we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil  i didn't say it to some environmental group in california   i said it in front of automakers in detroit  when i called for corporate responsibility so that middle class americans could get a tax cut  i said it in front of ceos on wall street  and when i was invited to speak out against george bush's plan to invade iraq as a senate candidate five years ago  i didn't listen to those who warned me that it was politically risky position to take  i listened to my gut  and i said loud and clear that this was the wrong war at the wrong time and congress should stand up and say so  that's the kind of leadership we need right now  that's why i'm this race  because i don't think you should settle for a president who's only there for you when it's easy or convenient or popular   i think you deserve a president who's willing to fight for you every hour of every day for the next four years  that's the change we can offer in     not change as a slogan  but change we can believe in  one year from now  we have the chance to tell all those corporate lobbyists that the days of them setting the agenda in washington are over  i have done more to take on lobbyists than any other candidate in this race   and i've won  i don't take a dime of their money  and when i am president  they won't find a job in my white house  because real change isn't another four years of defending lobbyists who don't represent real americans   it's standing with working americans who have seen their jobs disappear and their wages decline and their hope for the future slip further and further away  that's the change we can offer in   when i am president  i will end the tax giveaways to companies that ship our jobs overseas  and i will put the money in the pockets of working americans  and seniors  and homeowners who deserve a break  i won't wait ten years to raise the minimum wage   i'll raise it to keep pace every single year  and if american workers are being denied their right to organize when i'm in the white house  i will put on a comfortable pair of shoes and i will walk on that picket line with you as president of the united states  one year from now  we can stop campaigning on the outrage of   million uninsured americans and finally start doing something about it  i reformed health care in illinois  and i didn't do it alone   i did it by reaching out to democrats and republicans  we took on the insurance industry  and we won  that's how i'll pass a universal health care bill that allows every american to get the same kind of health care that members of congress get for themselves and cuts every family's premiums by up to   and mark my words   i will sign this bill by the end of my first term as president  that's the change we can offer in   one year from now  we can stop sending our children down corridors of shame and start putting them on a pathway to success  when i am president  we will stop passing bills called no child left behind that leave the money behind and start making real investments in education from cradle to adulthood  that means early childhood education  that means recruiting an army of new teachers  and paying them better  and supporting them more so they're not just teaching to test  but teaching to teach  and it means finally putting a college education within reach of every american  that's the change we can offer in   one year from now  we can stop sending hundreds of millions of dollars to dictators for their oil while we melt the polar ice caps in the bargain  i will raise our fuel standards  and put a cap on carbon emissions to reduce then   by   we'll tell polluters that they have to pay for their pollution  because they don't own the skies  the american people own the skies  and we'll use the money to invest in the clean  renewable fuels that are our future  that's the change we can offer in   in this election  we have the chance to turn the page on the last six years of being told that the only way for democrats to look tough on national security is to talk  and act  and vote like george bush republicans  when i'm your nominee  my opponent won't be able to say that i was for the war in iraq before i was against it  or that i supported an extension of the iraq war into iran  or that i support the bush cheney diplomacy of not talking to leaders we don't like  and he won't be able to say that i flip flopped on something as fundamental as whether our nation should use torture  because we are not a nation that makes excuses for torture  we are a nation that rejects it  that's the change we can offer in   when i am president  i will end this war in iraq  i will bring our troops home within sixteen months  i'll finish the fight against al qaeda in afghanistan  and i will lead the world against the common threats of the  st century   nuclear weapons and terrorism  climate change and poverty  genocide and disease  that's what democrats must stand for  and that's what america must stand for  and i'll be a president who finally sends a message to the black  white  and brown faces beyond our shores  from the halls of power to the huts of africa that says   you matter to america  your future is our future  and our moment is now  america  our moment is now  now is our chance to turn the page  now is our chance to write a new chapter  i am in this race because i don't want to see us spend the next year re fighting the washington battles of the  s  i don't want to pit blue america against red america  i want to lead a united states of america  i don't want this election to be about the past  because if it's about the future  we all win  if this election is about whether or not to end this war  or pass universal health care  or make more college affordable  it won't just be a democratic victory  it will be an american victory  that's the victory this country needs right now  this election and this moment are too important to settle for what we already know  the time has come to reach for what we know is possible  i am not running for this office to fulfill any long held plans or because i believe it is somehow owed to me  i never expected to be here  and i always knew the journey would be improbable  i've never been on one that wasn't  i am running because of what dr  king called  the fierce urgency of now  i am running because i do believe there's such a thing as being too late  and that hour is almost here  i'm running because i don't want to wake up one morning four years from now  and turn on one of those cable talk shows  and see that washington is still stuck in the same food fight it's been in for over a decade  i don't want to see that more americans lost their health care and fell into bankruptcy because we let the insurance industry spend millions to stop us for yet another year  i don't want to see that  i don't want to see that the oceans rose another few inches and the planet has reached the point of no return because we couldn't find a way to stop ourselves from buying oil from dictators  i don't want to see that  i don't want to see that we risked more american lives in another misguided war because no one had the judgment to ask the tough questions before we sent our troops to fight  i don't want to see that  i don't want to see homeless veterans on the street  i don't want to send another generation of children through corridors of shame  i don't want this future for my daughters and i do not accept this future for america  it is time to turn the page  i run for the presidency for the same reason i drove halfway across the country over two decades ago to bring jobs to the jobless and hope to the hopeless on the streets of chicago  for the same reason i stood up for justice and equality as a civil rights lawyer  for the same reason i've fought for illinois families for over a decade  because i will never forget that the only reason i am standing here today is because someone  somewhere stood up when it wasn't popular  when it was risky  when it was hard  and because that someone stood up  a few more did  and then a few thousand  and then a few million  and together  they changed the world  that's why i run in this election  i run to give my children and their children the same chances that someone  somewhere gave me  i run so that a year from today  there is a chance that the world will look at america differently  and that america will look at itself differently  and i run to keep the promise of the united states of america alive for all those who still hunger for opportunity and thirst for equality and long to believe again  that is the change that's possible in this election  that is the moment i want to seize as president  and i ask you all to join me in this journey  thank you   em as prepared for delivery em "], ["obama1", "thank you so much  to the great governor of iowa and lieutenant  governor of iowa  to my dear friend tom harkin for the outstanding work that he does  to the congressional delegation of iowa that is doing outstanding work and to nancy pelosi  madam speaker  thank you all for the wonderful welcome and the wonderful hospitality   responding to audience i love you back  a little less than one year from today  you will go into the voting booth and you will select the president of the united states of america  now  here's the good news   the name george w  bush will not be on the ballot  the name of my cousin dick cheney will not be on the ballot  we've been trying to hide that for a long time  everybody has a black sheep in the family  the era of scooter libby justice  and brownie incompetence  and karl rove politics will finally be over  but the question you're going to have to ask yourself when you caucus in january and you vote in november is   what's next for america  we are in a defining moment in our history  our nation is at war  the planet is in peril  the dream that so many generations fought for feels as if it's slowly slipping away  we are working harder for less  we've never paid more for health care or for college  it's harder to save and it's harder to retire  and most of all we've lost faith that our leaders can or will do anything about it  we were promised compassionate conservatism and all we got was katrina and wiretaps  we were promised a uniter  and we got a president who could not even lead the half of the country that voted for him  we were promised a more ethical and more efficient government  and instead we have a town called washington that is more corrupt and more wasteful than it was before  and the only mission that was ever accomplished is to use fear and falsehood to take this country to a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged  it is because of these failures that america is listening  intently  to what we say here today   not just democrats  but republicans and independents who've lost trust in their government  but want to believe again  and it is because of these failures that we not only have a moment of great challenge  but also a moment of great opportunity  we have a chance to bring the country together in a new majority   to finally tackle problems that george bush made far worse  but that had festered long before george bush ever took office   problems that we've talked about year after year after year after year  and that is why the same old washington textbook campaigns just won't do in this election  that's why not answering questions  cause we are afraid our answers won't be popular just won't do  that's why telling the american people what we think they want to hear instead of telling the american people what they need to hear just won't do  triangulating and poll driven positions because we're worried about what mitt or rudy might say about us just won't do  if we are really serious about wining this election democrats  we can't live in fear of losing it  this party   the party of jefferson and jackson  of roosevelt and kennedy   has always made the biggest difference in the lives of the american people when we led  not by polls  but by principle  not by calculation  but by conviction  when we summoned the entire nation to a common purpose   a higher purpose  and i run for the presidency of the united states of america because that's the party america needs us to be right now  a party that offers not just a difference in policies  but a difference in leadership  a party that doesn't just focus on how to win but why we should  a party that doesn't just offer change as a slogan  but real  meaningful change   change that america can believe in  that's why i'm in this race  that's why i am running for the presidency of the united states of america   to offer change that we can believe in  i am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in washington are over  i have done more than any other candidate in this race to take on lobbyists   and won  they have not funded my campaign  they will not get a job in my white house  and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i am president  i'm in this race to take those tax breaks away from companies that are moving jobs overseas and put them in the pockets of hard working americans who deserve it  and i won't raise the minimum wage every ten years  i will raise it to keep pace so that workers don't' fall behind  that is why i am in it  to protect the american worker  to fight for the american worker  i'm in this race because i want to stop talking about the outrage of   million americans without health care and start actually doing something about it  i expanded health care in illinois by bringing democrats and republicans together  by taking on the insurance industry  and that is how i will make certain that every single american in this country has health care they can count on and i won't do it twenty years from now  i won't do it ten years from now  i will do it by the end of my first term as president of the united states of america  i run for president to make sure that every american child has the best education that we have to offer  from the day they are born to the day they graduate from college  and i won't just talk about how great teachers are   as president i will reward them for their greatness   by raising salaries and giving them more support  that's why i'm in this race  i am running for president because i am sick and tired of democrats thinking that the only way to look tough on national security is by talking  and acting  and voting like george bush republicans  when i am this party's nominee  my opponent will not be able to say that i voted for the war in iraq  or that i gave george bush the benefit of the doubt on iran  or that i supported bush cheney policies of not talking to leaders that we don't like  and he will not be able to say that i wavered on something as fundamental as whether or not it is ok for america to torture   because it is never ok  that's why i am in it  as president  i will end the war in iraq  we will have our troops home in sixteen months  i will close guantanamo  i will restore habeas corpus  i will finish the fight against al qaeda  and i will lead the world to combat the common threats of the  st century   nuclear weapons and terrorism  climate change and poverty  genocide and disease  and i will send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says   you matter to us  your future is our future  and our moment is now  america  our moment is now  our moment is now  i don't want to spend the next year or the next four years re fighting the same fights that we had in the  s  i don't want to pit red america against blue america  i want to be the president of the united states of america  and if those republicans come at me with the same fear mongering and swift boating that they usually do  then i will take them head on  because i believe the american people are tired of fear and tired of distractions and tired of diversions  we can make this election not about fear  but about the future  and that won't just be a democratic victory  that will be an american victory  and that is a victory america needs right now  i am not in this race to fulfill some long held ambitions or because i believe it's somehow owed to me  i never expected to be here  i always knew this journey was improbable  i've never been on a journey that wasn't  i am running in this race because of what dr  king called  the fierce urgency of now  because i believe that there's such a thing as being too late  and that hour is almost upon us  i don't want to wake up four years from now and find out that millions of americans still lack health care because we couldn't take on the insurance industry  i don't want to see that the oceans have risen a few more inches  the planet has reached a point of no return because we couldn't find a way to stop buying oil from dictators  i don't want to see more american lives put at risk because no one had the judgment or the courage to stand up against a misguided war before we sent our troops into fight  i don't want to see homeless veterans on the streets  i don't want to send another generation of american children to failing schools  i don't want that future for my daughters  i don't want that future for your sons  i do not want that future for america  i'm in this race for the same reason that i fought for jobs for the jobless and hope for the hopeless on the streets of chicago  for the same reason i fought for justice and equality as a civil rights lawyer  for the same reason that i fought for illinois families for over a decade  because i will never forget that the only reason that i'm standing here today is because somebody  somewhere stood up for me when it was risky  stood up when it was hard  stood up when it wasn't popular  and because that somebody stood up  a few more stood up  and then a few thousand stood up  and then a few million stood up  and standing up  with courage and clear purpose  they somehow managed to change the world  that's why i'm running  iowa   to give our children and grandchildren the same chances somebody gave me  that's why i'm running  democrats   to keep the american dream alive for those who still hunger for opportunity  who still thirst for equality  that's why i'm asking you to stand with me  that's why i'm asking you to caucus for me  that's why i am asking you to stop settling for what the cynics say we have to accept  in this election   in this moment   let us reach for what we know is possible  a nation healed  a world repaired  an america that believes again  thank you very much everybody "], ["obama1", "we meet at a difficult time for organized labor  a while back  i went to a maytag plant in galesburg  illinois that was moving to mexico  and i met workers who were having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour  a few months ago  i traveled to newton  where maytag was shutting its doors after   years  one worker who'd been there more than a decade said   i just thought i would retire from here and never have another job  i'm scared  i'm scared  it makes us outraged to hear these stories  and we've been hearing them for a long time  it was stories like these that led me more than two decades ago to walk away from a career on wall street and become a community organizer in chicago  so i could help folks who'd lost jobs and lost hope when the nearby steel plants closed down  i didn't know a soul in chicago  but i knew i didn't like the idea of working people being laid off and not having anybody fighting for them  i knew i wanted to do my part to make sure they had a decent future  so when i go to places like galesburg or newton  it reminds me why i entered public service  and it reminds me why i'm a democrat  because if the democratic party means anything  then it has to mean we value labor  if the democratic party stands for anything  then it has to stand up for your rights  and your future  if the democratic party has a vision for america   then it has to be an america that's working for working americans  but we all know that for a long time now  we've had a president who doesn't see it that way  we have lived through six years of the most anti labor administration in generations  they don't believe in unions  they don't believe in organizing  they've packed the labor relations board with their corporate buddies  well  we've got news for them   it's not the department of management  it's the department of labor  and we're going to take it back  but despite six years of them doing everything they could to tear labor down   as i look out on this crowd and as i travel across this country  the one thing i know for certain is that the uaw is still fighting  the uaw is still mobilizing  the uaw is still organizing  i'm tired of playing defense  i know the uaw is tired of playing defense  we're ready to play some offense  we're ready to play offense for a secure retirement  we're ready to play offense to enforce labor laws  we're ready to play offense for universal health care  i'm tired of seeing unions go to the bargaining table and fight for the benefits they negotiated a long time ago  instead of fighting for better wages to support their families  i reformed health care in illinois  and i did it by reaching out to democrats and republicans  we took on the insurance industry  and we won  and that's what i'll do as president  i've got a plan that cuts costs for the typical family by up to   a year   more than any other plan that's been offered in this race  and i make this solemn pledge to you   i'll sign my universal health care plan into law by the end of my first term  we're ready to play offense for american workers  when i'm president  we're not going to wait twenty years or ten years to raise the minimum wage   we'll raise it to keep pace with inflation every year so that american workers aren't falling behind  and we'll take tax breaks away from companies that ship our jobs overseas and put them in the pockets of working americans who deserve it  we're not going to stop globalization in its tracks  but we shouldn't be standing idly by while american jobs are shipped overseas  it's time to put main street ahead of wall street when it comes to trade  the only trade agreements i believe in are ones that put workers first   because trade deals aren't good for the american people if they aren't good for working people  that's why i opposed cafta  that's why i oppose the south korea free trade agreement  that's why i voted to block mexican trucks from entering this country  and that's why we need to amend nafta  we're ready to take the offense for organized labor  it's time we had a president who didn't choke saying the word  union  we need to strengthen our unions by letting them do what they do best   organize our workers  if a majority of workers want a union  they should get a union  it's that simple  we need to stand up to the business lobby that's been getting their friends in congress and in the white house to block card check  that's why i was one of the leaders fighting to pass the employee free choice act  that's why i'm fighting for it in the senate  and that's why we'll make it the law of the land when i'm president  there are few more important unions in this country than the uaw  you created the auto industry  you secured good paying jobs for generations of workers  and you built the american middle class   the backbone of our economy  so i know someone once said what's good for gm is good for america  but it's time we also recognized that what's good for the uaw is good for america  we need to help you compete with workers around the world by helping the auto industry compete with car companies all over the world  yes  that means raising our fuel standards so we can make the fuel efficient cars that are the future of your industry  but it also means giving you the help you need to retool your plants so we can build these cars right here in america  and if we can do that  we'll create thousands and thousands of jobs in the process  but if we're serious about helping you compete abroad  we need to stand up for you here at home  that's why i called mike sheridan with local   in wisconsin the day they decided to strike gm  and gave him my support  and i made the same call to dan kirk with local   when chrysler workers went on strike  and larry sharpe and his members in local   from my home state of illinois can't be here today because they're striking international truck and engine  but larry knows he has my support  because when you hit the picket lines   whether it's with gm or chrysler or anybody else   you aren't just fighting for your own rights  you're fighting for the rights of every american worker  but it's going to be hard to do all this   it's going to be hard to make the uaw's agenda america's agenda   until we end this war in iraq  this is a war i opposed in   it's a war i opposed in   and in   and   and   this is a war that should have never been authorized and never been waged  and we shouldn't compound the mistake of going in by waiting any longer to pull our troops out  that's why i've called for us to start withdrawing troops not next month  not next year   now  this is a defining moment in our history  our nation is at war  the dream that so many generations fought for feels as if it's slowly slipping away  we are working harder for less  we've never paid more for health care or for college  it's harder to save and it's harder to retire  and most of all we've lost faith that our leaders can or will do anything about it  and it is because of this that america is listening  intently  to what my fellow candidates and i are saying   not just democrats  but republicans and independents who've lost trust in their government  but want to believe again  so in this election  we have a chance to bring the country together in a new majority   to finally tackle problems that george bush made far worse  but that had festered long before george bush ever took office   problems that we've talked about year after year after year after year  and that is why the same old washington textbook campaigns just won't do in this election  that's why not answering questions because we're afraid our answers won't be popular just won't do  that's why telling the american people what we think they want to hear instead of telling the american people what they need to hear just won't do  triangulating and poll driven positions because we're worried about what mitt or rudy might say about us just won't do  if we're really serious about winning this election  we can't live in fear of losing it  the democratic party has always made the biggest difference in the lives of the american people when we've led not by polls  but by principle  not by calculation  but by conviction  when we summoned the entire nation to a common purpose   a higher purpose  and i run for the presidency of the united states of america because that's the party america needs us to be right now  a party that offers not just a difference in policies  but a difference in leadership  a party that doesn't just focus on how to win but why we should  a party that doesn't just offer change as a slogan  but real  meaningful change   change that america can believe in  that's why i'm in this race  that's why i am running for president of the united states of america  now  i know we've got a lot of good candidates in this race  and i know they're saying the right things when they come and talk to you  but politicians often say they're pro labor at election time no matter what they've said or done before  and that leaves you wondering what they will say or do after the election  so when a candidate rails against nafta today  it's fair to ask her where she's been before  when a candidate says he opposes right to work laws or trade rules that hurt workers today  ask him where he's been before  because what you need  what america needs  is a president who will fight for you when it's hard  and not just when it's politically convenient  and that's exactly what i intend to do  because politics didn't lead me to working folks   working folks led me into politics  i was standing with american workers on the streets of chicago twenty years ago  and the reason i'm here today is because i don't want to wake up one day many years from now and see that we're still standing by while american jobs get shipped overseas  so i'm not just here to give a speech  i don't like just talking about the problems we face in this country  i want to solve them  so i'm here to ask for your support  region   i'm here to ask you to believe not just in me  but in your own sense of possibility  your own imagination about what america might be  imagine a president whose life's story was like so many of your own  who knows what it's like to go to college on scholarships  who knows what it's like to see his mother get sick and worry that maybe she can't pay the medical bills  imagine a president who knows what it's like to put on a comfortable pair of shoes and walk with you on that picket line  who gives denny williams a call before any major piece of labor legislation crosses his desk  so even if we don't see eye to eye on everything  your voice will be heard  imagine an america where we don't have to keep playing defense because we can finally play some offense  that future is within our grasp  we can build that america together if you join me  but each of us has to do our part  so i just want to close with a story about the difference that one voice can make "], ["obama1", "i've visited many schools and spoken to many teachers and students throughout my two decades of public service  but one i'll always remember is my visit to dodge elementary school in chicago just a few years ago  i was talking with a young teacher there  and i asked her what she saw as the biggest challenge facing her students  she gave me an answer that i had never heard before  she spoke about what she called  these kids syndrome    the tendency to explain away the shortcomings and failures of our education system by saying that  these kids can't learn  or  these kids don't want to learn  or  these kids are just too far behind  and after awhile   these kids  become somebody else's problem  and this teacher looked at me and said   when i hear that term it drives me nuts  they're not  these kids ' they're our kids  all of them  she's absolutely right  the small child in manchester or nashua whose parents can't find or afford a quality pre school that we know would make him more likely to stay in school  and read better  and succeed later in life   he is our child  the little girl in rural south carolina or the south side of chicago whose school is literally falling down around her  and can't afford new textbooks  and can't attract new teachers because it can't afford to pay them a decent salary   she is our child  the teenager in suburban boston who needs more skills and better schooling to compete for the same jobs as the teenager in bangalore or beijing   he is our child  these children are our children  their future is our future  and it's time we understood that their education is our responsibility  all of us  this is a defining moment for our generation  revolutions in communications and technology have created a global economy of high tech  high wage jobs that can be located anywhere there's an internet connection   an economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge  education is now the currency of the information age  it's no longer just a pathway to opportunity and success   it's a pre requisite  there simply aren't as many jobs today that can support a family where only a high school degree is required  and if you don't have that degree  there are even fewer jobs available that can keep you out of poverty  in this kind of economy  countries who out educate us today will out compete us tomorrow  already  china is graduating eight times as many engineers as we are  by twelfth grade  our children score lower on math and science tests than most other kids in the world  and we now have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation in the world  well i do not accept this future for america  i do not accept an america where we do nothing about six million students who are reading below their grade level   an america where sixty percent of african american fourth graders aren't even reading at the basic level  i do not accept an america where only twenty percent of our students are prepared to take college level classes in english  math  and science   where barely one in ten low income students will ever graduate from college  i do not accept an america where we do nothing about the fact that half of all teenagers are unable to understand basic fractions   where nearly nine in ten african american and latino eighth graders are not proficient in math  i do not accept an america where elementary school kids are only getting an average of twenty five minutes of science each day when we know that over   of the fastest growing jobs require a knowledge base in math and science  this kind of america is morally unacceptable for our children  it's economically untenable for our future  and it's not who we are as a country  we are not a  these kids' nation  we are the nation that has always understood that our future is inextricably linked to the education of our children   all of them  we are the country that has always believed in thomas jefferson's declaration that  talent and virtue  needed in a free society  should be educated regardless of wealth or birth  it's this belief that led america to set up the first free public schools in small new england towns  it's a promise we kept as we moved from a nation of farms to factories and created a system of public high schools so that everyone had the chance to succeed in a new economy  it's a promise we expanded after world war ii  when america gave my grandfather and over two million returning heroes the chance to go to college on the gi bill  and when america has fallen short of this promise   when we forced linda brown to walk miles to a dilapidated topeka school because of the color of her skin  it was ordinary americans who marched and bled  who took to the streets and fought in the courts until the arrival of nine little children at a little rock school made real the decision that in america  separate can never be equal  that's who we are  that's why i can stand here today  because somebody stood up when it was hard  stood up when it was risky  because even though my mother didn't have a lot of money  scholarships gave me the chance to go to some of the best schools in the country  and i am running for president of the united states because i want to give every american child the same chances that i had  in this election   at this defining moment   we can decide that this century will be another american century by making an historic commitment to education  we can make a commitment that's more than just the rhetoric of a campaign   one that's more than another empty promise made by a politician looking for your vote  i often say that the problem with no child left behind is that george bush left the money behind  and it wasn't just him  either  it's pretty popular to bash no child left behind out on the campaign trail  but when it was being debated in congress four years ago  my colleague dick durbin offered everyone a chance to vote so that the law couldn't be enforced unless it was fully funded  senator edwards and senator clinton passed on that chance  and i believe that was a serious mistake  because i think we'd all agree that the goals of this law were the right ones  making a promise to educate every child with an excellent teacher is right  closing the achievement gap that exists in too many cities and rural areas is right  making sure that necessary resources and qualified teachers are distributed equitably among every city and small town is right  more accountability is right  higher standards are right  but i'll tell you what's wrong with no child left behind  forcing our teachers  our principals  and our schools to accomplish all of this without the resources they need is wrong  promising high quality teachers in every classroom and then leaving the support and the pay for those teachers behind is wrong  labeling a school and its students as failures one day and then throwing your hands up and walking away from them the next is wrong  and by the way   don't tell us that the only way to teach a child is to spend most of the year preparing him to fill in a few bubbles on a standardized test  don't tell us that these tests have to come at the expense of music  or art  or phys  ed  or science  these tests shouldn't come at the expense of a well rounded education   they should help complete that well rounded education  the teachers i've met didn't devote their lives to testing  they devoted them to teaching  and teaching our children is what they should be allowed to do  the fact is  no child left behind has done more to stigmatize and demoralize our students and teachers in struggling schools than it has to marshal the talent and the determination and the resources to turn them around  that's what's wrong with no child left behind  and that's what we must change in a fundamental way  i want to lead a new era of mutual responsibility in education   one where we all come together for the sake of our children's success  an era where each of us does our part to make that success a reality   parents and teachers  leaders in washington and citizens all across america  i won't pretend that this will be easy  we must fix the failures of no child left behind  we must provide the funding we were promised  and give our states the resources they need  and finally meet our commitment to special education  but that alone is not an education policy  it's just a starting point  a truly historic commitment to education   a real commitment   will require new resources and new reforms  it will require a willingness to break free from the same debates that washington has been engaged in for decades   democrat versus republican  vouchers versus the status quo  more money versus more accountability  and most of all  it will take a president who is honest about the challenges we face   who doesn't just tell everyone what they want to hear  but what they need to hear  i am running to be that president  and that's why i'm proposing a comprehensive plan to give every american child the chance to receive the best education america has to offer   from the moment they're born to the day they graduate college  as president  i will put the full resources of the federal government behind this plan  but to make it a reality  i will also ask more of teachers and principals  parents and students  schools and communities  a few weeks ago  i introduced my plan to make college affordable by creating a   per year refundable tax credit that will cover two thirds of the tuition at the average public college or university  and yesterday  i unveiled my proposal to strengthen our community colleges by offering new degrees for emerging fields and rewarding schools that graduate more students  today  i want to talk about what we can do to prepare every student to succeed in college   preparation that begins at birth and continues with world class schools  outstanding teachers  and transformative principals  the first part of my plan focuses on providing quality  affordable early childhood education to every american child  we know what a difference early childhood programs make in the lives of our kids  study after study proves that children in these programs   especially low income children   are more likely to score higher in reading and math  more likely to graduate high school and attend college  more likely to hold a job and more likely to earn more on that job  and for every   we invest in these programs  we get   back in reduced welfare rolls  fewer health care costs  and less crime  in recent years  states have been able to enroll nearly one million four year olds in pre kindergarten programs  that's a great success  but i believe we can do better  we need to enroll more children and we need to start at an even earlier age  because the fact is  studies show that from the time of conception to the first day of kindergarten  children's development progresses faster than at any other stage of life  by the age of three    of the brain's core structure is already formed  eighty five percent  so here's what we did in illinois  as a state senator  i helped create the illinois early learning council  which launched a program called preschool for all  this has made us one of the first states to commit to a high quality early learning program that starts helping children from the day they're born  it provides early care and education for new families as well as at risk infants and toddlers  and offer at risk three year olds and all four year olds the chance to enroll in pre kindergarten programs  there is no reason we can't and shouldn't replicate this all across america  as president  i will launch a children's first agenda that provides care  learning and support to families with children ages zero to five  we'll create early learning grants to help states create a system of high quality early care and education for all young children and their families  we'll increase head start funding and quadruple early start to include a quarter of a million at risk children  i will create a presidential early learning council to coordinate this effort across all levels of government and ensure that we're providing these children and families with the highest quality programs  and we'll help more working parents find a safe  affordable place to leave their children during the day by improving the educational quality of our child care programs and increasing the child care tax credit  that's how we'll give our kids the best possible start in life  and that's the commitment america will make when i am president  the second part of my education plan is to recruit  support  and reward teachers and principals to ensure that every school in america is filled with outstanding educators  we know that from the moment our children step into a classroom  the single most important factor in determining their achievement is not the color of their skin or where they come from  it's not who their parents are or how much money they have  it's who their teacher is  it's the man or woman who stays past the last bell and spends their own money on books and supplies  it's people like my sister who go beyond the call of duty because she believes that's what makes the extra difference  and it does  well if we know how much teaching matters  it's time america started acting like it  it's time we treated teaching like the profession it is  i don't want to just talk about how great teachers are   i want to be a president who rewards them for their greatness  that starts with recruiting a new generation of teachers and principals to replace the generation that's retiring and to keep up with the record number of students entering our schools  we'll create a new service scholarship program to recruit top talent into the profession  and begin by placing these new teachers in areas like the overcrowded districts of nevada  or struggling rural towns here in new hampshire  or hard to staff subjects like math and science in schools all across the nation  and i will make this pledge as president   if you commit your life to teaching  america will commit to paying for your college education  to prepare our new teachers  we'll require that all schools of education are accredited  and we'll evaluate their outcomes so that we know which ones are doing the best job at preparing the best teachers  we'll also create a voluntary national performance assessment that actually looks at how prospective teachers can plan  teach  and support student learning  so we can be sure that every new educator is trained and ready to walk into the classroom and start teaching effectively  new hampshire is already leading the way here by having designed a performance based educator preparation system  and the national assessment i'm proposing would help states like this one achieve their goals for state of the art preparation of all teachers   to support our teachers  we will expand mentoring programs that pair experienced  successful teachers with new recruits  we know that mentoring is one of the most effective ways to retain the one third of new teachers who leave the profession in the first five years  in states that have tried this  like california  only five percent of new teachers have quit  as president  i will expand these mentoring programs nationwide to give all our teachers the chance to succeed  and i will also make sure that teachers have the conditions in which they can succeed   including excellent principals who support their work  the materials they need to teach effectively  and time to plan and collaborate with one another on improving instruction  and where they do succeed   where our teachers and principals go above and beyond the call to make a real difference in our children's lives   i think it's time we rewarded them for it  cities like denver have already proven that by working with teachers  this can work   that we can find new ways to increase pay that are developed with teachers  not imposed on them and not just based on an arbitrary test score  my plan would provide resources to try these innovative programs in school districts all across america  under my career ladder initiative  these districts will be able to design programs that reward accomplished educators who serve as mentors to new teachers with the salary increase they deserve  they can reward those who teach in underserved places like rural new hampshire and across urban america  and if teachers acquire additional knowledge and skills to serve students better   if they consistently excel in the classroom   that work can be valued and rewarded as well  now  if we do all this and find that there are teachers who are still struggling and underperforming  we should provide them with individual help and support  and if they're still underperforming after that  we should find a quick and fair way to put another teacher in that classroom  teacher associations and school boards in a number of cities have led the way by developing peer assistance and review plans that do exactly this   setting professional standards that put children first  we owe our teachers that  and we owe our children that  and while we're at it  let's finally help our teachers and principals develop assessments that teach our kids to become more than just good test takers  that's why the third part of my plan is to work with our nation's governors and educators to create and use assessments that can improve achievement all across america by including the kinds of research  scientific investigation  and problem solving that our children will need to compete in a  st century knowledge economy  new hampshire has been a leader on this  you've developed innovative assessments  including digital portfolios  to develop and demonstrate student proficiency in technology  science  and other core content areas  and there's no reason we can't start replicating this all across the country  the goal of educational testing should be the same as medical testing   to diagnose a student's needs so you can help address them  tests should not be designed as punishment for teachers and students  they should be used as tools to help our children grow and compete  tests should support learning  not just accounting  because if we really want our children to become the great inventors and problem solvers of tomorrow  our schools shouldn't stifle innovation  they should let it thrive  one of the subject areas where this is especially important is science  no child left behind's intense emphasis on teaching to the test has been shown to reduce the amount of time spent on teaching and assessing science   a subject area that is absolutely critical to our competitiveness as a nation  when i'm president  we will make science instruction a national priority  and we'll develop assessments that don't just test isolated bits of information  but advanced skills like logic  data analysis  and interpretation  new hampshire has already begun to do this  and there's no reason the rest of the country can't do the same thing  finally  as you and i stand here today  know that there is a generation of children growing up on the mean streets and forgotten corners of this country who are slipping away from us as we speak  they walk down corridors of shame in rural south carolina and sit in battered classrooms somewhere in east l a  they are overwhelmingly black and latino and poor  and when they look around and see that no one has lifted a finger to fix their school since the  th century  when they are pushed out the door at the sound of the last bell   some into a virtual war zone   is it any wonder they don't think their education is important  is it any wonder that they are dropping out in rates we've never seen before  i know these children  i know their sense of hopelessness  i began my career over two decades ago as a community organizer on the streets of chicago's south side  and i worked with parents and teachers and local leaders to fight for their future  we set up after school programs and we even protested outside government offices so that we could get those who had dropped out into alternative schools  and in time  we changed futures  and so while i know hopelessness  i also know hope  i know that if we bring early education programs to these communities  if we stop waiting until high school to address the drop out rate and start in earlier grades  if we bring in new  qualified teachers  if we expand college outreach programs like gear up and trio and fight to expand summer learning opportunities like i've done in the senate  if we do all this  we can make a difference in the lives of our children and the life of this country   not just in east l a  or the south side of chicago  but here in manchester  and suburban boston  and rural mississippi  i know we can  i've seen it happen  and i will work every day to do it again as your president  but i cannot do it alone  government cannot do it alone  we can spend billion after billion on education in this country  we can develop a program for every problem imaginable  and we can fund those programs with every last dime we have  but there is no program and no policy that can substitute for a parent who is involved in their child's education from day one  there is no substitute for a parent who will attend those parent teacher conferences  make sure their children are in school on time  and help them with their homework after dinner  and i have no doubt that we will still be talking about these problems in the next century if we do not have parents who are willing to turn off the tv once in awhile  and put away the video games  and read to their child  responsibility for our children's education has to start at home  we have to set high standards for them  and spend time with them  and love them  we have to hold ourselves accountable  you know a few years ago  a little girl at earhart elementary in chicago was asked the secret to her academic success  she said   i just study hard every night because i like learning  my teacher wants me to be a good student  and so does my mother  i don't want to let them down  the challenge we face at this moment is great  but we have met great challenges before  over the course of two centuries  we have fought and struggled and overcome to expand the promise of a good education ever further   a promise that has allowed millions to transcend the barriers of race and class and background to achieve their god given potential  it is now our moment to keep that promise   the promise of america   alive in the  st century  it's our generation's turn to stand up and say to the little girl in chicago  or the little boy in manchester  or the millions like them all across the country that they are not  these kids'   they are our kids  they do not want to let us down  and we cannot let them down either  that's what i'll be fighting for in this election  and that's what i'll do as president of the united states  i hope you'll join me in that journey  thank you "], ["obama1", "less than a year from now  you will go into the voting booth and you will select the president of the united states of america  now  here's the good news   the name george w  bush will not be on the ballot  the name of my cousin dick cheney will not be on the ballot  we've been trying to hide that for a long time  everybody has a black sheep in the family  the era of scooter libby justice  and brownie incompetence  and karl rove politics will finally be over  but the question you're going to have to ask yourself when you vote this year and next is this   what's next for america  we are in a defining moment in our history  our nation is at war  the planet is in peril  the dream that so many generations fought for feels as if it's slowly slipping away  we are working harder for less  we've never paid more for health care or for college  it's harder to save and it's harder to retire  and most of all we've lost faith that our leaders can or will do anything about it  we were promised compassionate conservatism and all we got was katrina and wiretaps  we were promised a uniter  and we got a president who could not even lead the half of the country that voted for him  we were promised a more ethical and more efficient washington  and instead we have a town that is more corrupt and more wasteful than it was before  and the only mission that was ever accomplished is to use fear and falsehood to take this country to a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged  it is because of these failures that america is listening  intently  to what we say here today   not just democrats  but republicans and independents who've lost trust in their government  but want to believe again  and it is because of these failures that we not only have a moment of great challenge  but also a moment of great opportunity  we have a chance to bring the country together in a new majority   to finally tackle problems that george bush made far worse  but that had festered long before george bush ever took office   problems that we've talked about year after year after year and that is why the same old washington textbook campaigns just won't do in this election  an electoral strategy that starts out leaving half the country behind just won't do  telling the american people what we think they want to hear instead of telling the american people what they need to hear just won't do  triangulating and poll driven positions because we're worried about what mitt or rudy might say about us just won't do  if we are really serious about wining this election democrats  we can't live in fear of losing it  this party   the party of jefferson and jackson  of roosevelt and kennedy   has always made the biggest difference in the lives of the american people when we led  not by polls  but by principle  not by calculation  but by conviction  when we summoned the entire nation to a common purpose   a higher purpose  and i run for the presidency of the united states of america because that's the party america needs us to be right now  a party that doesn't just offer change as a slogan  but real  meaningful change   change that america can believe in  that's why i'm in this race  i am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in washington are over  i have done more than any other candidate in this race to take on lobbyists   and won  they have not funded my campaign  they will not get a job in my white house  and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i am president  i'm in this race to take those tax breaks away from companies that are moving jobs overseas and put them in the pockets of hard working americans who deserve it  and i won't raise the minimum wage every ten years  i will raise it to keep pace so that workers don't' fall behind  that is why i am in it  i'm in this race because i want to stop talking about the outrage of   million americans without health care and start actually doing something about it  i expanded health care in illinois by bringing democrats and republicans together  by taking on the insurance industry  and i have put forth a universal health care plan that will do more to cut the cost of health care than any other proposal in this race  here's the truth   if you can't afford health insurance right now  you will when i'm president  anyone who tells you otherwise is more interested in scoring points than solving problems  and i'm in it because we've had enough of that  i run for president to make sure that every american child has the best education that we have to offer  from the day they are born to the day they graduate from college  and i won't just talk about how great teachers are   as president i will reward them for their greatness   by raising salaries and giving them more support  that's why i'm in this race  i am running for president because i am sick and tired of democrats thinking that the only way to look tough on national security is by talking  and acting  and voting like george bush republicans  when i am this party's nominee  my opponent will not be able to say that i voted for the war in iraq  or that i gave george bush the benefit of the doubt on iran  or that i supported bush cheney policies of not talking to leaders that we don't like  and he will not be able to say that i wavered on something as fundamental as whether or not it is ok for america to torture   because it is never ok  that's why i am in it  as president  i will end the war in iraq  we will have our troops home in sixteen months  i will close guantanamo  i will restore habeas corpus  i will finish the fight against al qaeda  and i will lead the world to combat the common threats of the  st century   nuclear weapons and terrorism  climate change and poverty  genocide and disease  and i will send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says   you matter to us  your future is our future  and our moment is now  america  our moment is now  our moment is now  i don't want to spend   re fighting the same fights that we had in the  s  that's exactly what mitt and rudy want  that's they're only hope of winning because they know that if this election is about health care  or ending this war  or making college affordable  then they will lose  they are counting on the same bitter partisanship and the same electoral map we've had for far too long  i believe i can transform that map  in my senate race i won some of the reddest  most republican counties in illinois  in   when house and senate candidates in states like missouri  and nebraska  and tennessee  and virginia  and indiana needed someone to come campaign for them  i was the one they called  and i'm attracting more independents and republicans to our cause than anyone else in this campaign  it's because i believe we can build that new majority   not just to win  but to govern   to actually get something done  i don't want to pit red america against blue america  i want to be president of the united states of america  and that won't just be a democratic victory  that will be an american victory  and that is a victory america needs right now  i am not in this race to fulfill some long held ambitions or because i believe it's somehow owed to me  i never expected to be here  i always knew this journey was improbable  i've never been on a journey that wasn't  i am running in this race because of what dr  king called  the fierce urgency of now  because i believe that there's such a thing as being too late  and that hour is almost upon us  i don't want to wake up four years from now and find out that millions of americans still lack health care because we couldn't take on the insurance industry  i don't want to see that the oceans have risen a few more inches  the planet has reached a point of no return because we couldn't find a way to stop buying oil from dictators  i don't want to see more american lives put at risk because no one had the judgment or the courage to stand up against a misguided war before we sent our troops into fight  i don't want to see homeless veterans on the streets  i don't want to send another generation of american children to failing schools  i don't want that future for my daughters  i don't want that future for your sons  i do not want that future for america  i'm in this race for the same reason that i fought for jobs for the jobless and hope for the hopeless on the streets of chicago  for the same reason i fought for justice and equality as a civil rights lawyer  for the same reason that i fought for illinois families for over a decade  because i will never forget that the only reason that i'm standing here today is because somebody  somewhere stood up for me when it was risky  stood up when it was hard  stood up when it wasn't popular  and because that somebody stood up  a few more stood up  and then a few thousand stood up  and then a few million stood up  and standing up  with courage and clear purpose  they somehow managed to change the world  that's why i'm running  democrats   to give our children and grandchildren the same chances somebody gave me  that's why i'm running   to keep the american dream alive for those who still hunger for opportunity  who still thirst for equality  that's why i'm asking you to stand with me  that's why i'm asking you to vote for me  that's why i am asking you to stop settling for what the cynics say we have to accept  in this election   in this moment   let us reach for what we know is possible  a nation healed  a world repaired  an america that believes again  thank you very much everybody "], ["obama1", "it is an honor to be introduced by harris wofford   one of america's greatest advocates for public service  starting with the civil rights movement and the peace corps  harris and a generation of americans answered a call to service  at a pivotal moment in our history  they stood up  they changed america  and they changed the world  today  it's easy for us to get caught thinking that there are two different stories at work in our lives  there is the story of our day to day cares and responsibilities  and there is the story of what's happening in the wider world   a story viewed through headlines and websites  a destiny to be shaped by forces beyond our control  i am here today to ask you to reject this notion  and to invite you to take hold of the future of your country  because your own story and the american story are not separate   they are shared  and they will both be enriched if we stand up together  and answer a new call to service to meet the challenges of our new century  i say this to you as someone whose presence on this stage is unlikely  my father came from thousands of miles away  in kenya  and went back there soon after i was born  i spent a childhood adrift  i was raised in hawaii and indonesia  i lived with my single mom and with my grandparents from kansas  growing up  i wasn't always sure who i was  or where i was going  then  when i was about your age  i decided to become a community organizer  i wrote letters to every organization in the country that i could think of  and for a while  i got no response  finally  this small group of churches on the south side of chicago wrote back and offered me a job to come help neighborhoods devastated by steel plant closings  my mother and grandparents wanted me to go to law school  my friends were applying to jobs on wall street  i didn't know a soul in chicago  and the salary was about   a year  plus   to buy an old  beat up car  i still remember a conversation i had with an older man before i left  he looked and said   barack  i'll give you a bit of advice  forget this community organizing business and do something that's gonna make you some money  you can't change the world  and people won't appreciate you trying  you've got a nice voice  what you should do is go into television broadcasting  i'm telling you  you've got a future  now  he may have had a point about the tv thing  and to tell you the truth  i didn't have a clear answer about what i was doing  i wanted to step into the currents of history and help people fight for their dreams  but didn't know what my role would be  i was inspired by what people like harris did in the civil rights movement  but when i got to chicago  there were no marches  no soaring speeches  in the shadow of an empty steel plant  there were just a lot of folks struggling  day after day  i heard  no' a lot more than i heard  yes ' i saw plenty of empty chairs in those meetings we put together  but even as i discovered that you can't bend history to your will  i found that you could do your part to see that   in the words of dr  king   it  bends toward justice  in church basements and around kitchen tables  block by block  we brought the community together  registered new voters  fought for new jobs  and helped people live lives with some measure of dignity  eventually  i realized i wasn't just helping other people  through service  i found a community that embraced me  a church to belong to  citizenship that was meaningful  the direction i'd been seeking  through service  i found that my own improbable story fit into a larger american story  in america  each of us seeks our own dreams  but the sum of those dreams must be greater than ourselves  because the america we inherited is the legacy of those who struggled  and those who served in so many ways  before us  it's the legacy of a band of unlikely patriots who overthrew the tyranny of a king  it's the legacy of abolitionists who stood up  and soldiers who fought for a more perfect union  it's the legacy of those who started to teach in our schools and tend to the sick in our cities  who laid the rails and volunteered to uphold the law as america moved west  it's the legacy of men who faced the depression by putting on the uniform of the civilian conservation corps  of women who worked on that arsenal of democracy and built the tanks and ships and bomber aircraft to fight fascism  it's the legacy of those women's suffragists and freedom riders who stood up for justice  and young people who answered president kennedy's call to go forth in a peace corps  the sacrifices made by previous generations have never been easy  but america is a great nation precisely because americans have been willing to stand up when it was hard  to serve on stages both great and small  to rise above moments of great challenge and terrible trial  one of those moments took place on september     whether you lived in manhattan or here in mount vernon  you felt the pain and loss of that day not just as an individual  but as an american  that's why we lined up to give blood  that's why we held vigils and flew flags  that's why we rallied behind our president  we had a chance to step into the currents of history  we were ready to answer a new call for our country  but the call never came  instead  we were asked to go shopping  and to prove our patriotism by supporting a war in iraq that should never have been authorized  and never been waged  we have lost precious time  our nation is less secure and less respected in the world  our energy dependence has risen  and so has the specter of climate change  more of our children have been left behind  instead of a call to unity  we got a political strategy of division  the burden of service has fallen  more and more  on the brave men and women of our military who heroically serve tour after tour of duty in a war without end  when i was thinking about whether or not to seek the presidency  there were some voices who counseled me to wait  you seem like a gifted young man  they said   why not wait around washington a few more years  or when i started talking about a politics of hope  some just rolled their eyes and echoed the words of that man from my younger days  you can't change the world  and people won't appreciate you trying  well i am running for president   right now   because i refuse to let this moment pass  the decisions we make today will shape the century that my daughters   and your children   grow up in  i have not served the cause of america for over two decades to stay on the sidelines at a time when that cause is being challenged at home and abroad  if we don't rise up to seize this moment  then we may not get another  i have no doubt that in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it  but i hold no illusions that one man or woman can do this alone  that's why my campaign has called nearly   americans to a common purpose  that's why i'm reaching out to democrats  and also to independents and republicans  and that is why i won't just ask for your vote as a candidate  i will ask for your service and your active citizenship when i am president of the united states  this will not be a call issued in one speech or program  this will be a cause of my presidency  first  we will create new opportunities for all americans to serve  and to direct that service to our most pressing national challenges  americans have shown they want to step up  i see it everywhere i go  the brave young men and women who have signed up to defend our country  the volunteers fighting poverty in rural america and to rebuild new orleans  students getting their colleges to divest to stop the genocide in darfur  the thousands of young americans who have flooded the applicant pool for teach for america  retirees who are devoting their time to serve  but we're not keeping pace with the demand of those who want to serve  and we're not leveraging that commitment to meet national challenges  fdr not only enlisted americans to create employment  he targeted that service to build our infrastructure and conserve our environment  jfk not only called on a new generation  he made their service a bridge to the developing world  and a bright light of american values in the darkest days of the cold war  today  americorps   our nation's network of local  state and national service programs   has   slots  as president  i will increase that to   and make that increased service a vehicle to meet national goals like providing health care and education  saving our planet and restoring our standing in the world  so that citizens see their efforts connected to a common purpose  people of all ages  stations  and skills will be asked to serve  because when it comes to the challenges we face  the american people are not the problem   they are the answer  to help every american receive a world class education  we will create a new classroom corps  we'll have college students  recent graduates and retirees mentor young people  engineers and scientists will help make sure the next generation of innovators is educated here in america  civic  business and faith leaders will develop new after school programs for our kids  to free ourselves from energy dependence and to confront climate change  we will create a new energy corps  we'll ask you to work on renewable energy projects  to teach folks about conservation  and to help clean up polluted areas  and we'll send talented american engineers and scientists abroad to help developing countries promote low carbon energy development  to restore america's standing  i will call on our greatest resource   not our bombs  guns  or dollars   i will call upon our people  we will grow the foreign service to renew our commitment to diplomacy  we will double the size of the peace corps by its  th anniversary in   and we'll reach out to other nations to engage their young people in similar programs  so that we work side by side to take on the common challenges that confront all humanity  i will expand our military  while offering those who serve the promise that they will get the training  equipment  and care they deserve   and that they can trust we will never  ever  send them to fight in a misguided war  and we'll enlist veterans to help other veterans find jobs  to counsel vets who are confronting homelessness  mental health and substance abuse problems  and to pitch in at va hospitals and nursing homes  some of these programs will be full time  some will be part time opportunities for those who are working  and we'll expand and improve senior corps programs to attract new retirees with substantive service opportunities  so that service becomes a core part of active retirement and we'll use technology to connect people to service more extensively and effectively  we turn to websites like craigslist to find apartments and jobs  so we'll expand usa freedom corps to create an online network where americans can browse opportunities to volunteer  you'll be able to search by category  time commitment  and skill sets  you'll be able to rate service opportunities  build service networks  and create your own service pages to track your hours and activities  this will empower more americans to craft their own service agenda  and make their own change from the bottom up  the second thing i'll do is invest in ideas that can help us meet our common challenges  because more often than not the next great social innovation won't be generated by the government  the non profit sector employs   in   americans and   nonprofits are launched every day  yet while the federal government invests   billion in research and development for the private sector  there is no similar effort to support non profit innovation  meanwhile  there are ideas across america   in our inner cities and small towns  from college graduates to folks making a career change   that could benefit millions of americans if they're given the chance to grow  as president  i will launch a new social investment fund network  it's time to get the grass roots  the foundations  the private sector and the government at the table  we'll invest in ideas that work  leverage private sector dollars to encourage innovation  and expand successful programs to scale  take a program like the harlem children's zone  which helps thousands of kids in new york through after school activities  mentoring  and family support  we need to make that model work in different cities around the country  and i'll start a new social entrepreneur agency to make sure that small non profits have the same kind of support that we give small businesses  the third part of my plan will be integrating service into education  so that young americans are called upon and prepared to be active citizens  just as we teach math and writing  arts and athletics  we need to teach young americans to take citizenship seriously  study after study shows that students who serve do better in school  are more likely to go to college  and more likely to maintain that service as adults  so when i'm president  i will set a goal for all american middle and high school students to perform   hours of service a year  and for all college students to perform   hours of service a year  this means that by the time you graduate college  you'll have done   weeks of service  we'll reach this goal in several ways  at the middle and high school level  we'll make federal assistance conditional on school districts developing service programs  and give schools resources to offer new service opportunities  at the community level  we'll develop public private partnerships so students can serve more outside the classroom  for college students  i have proposed an annual american opportunity tax credit of   to make tuition affordable  to receive this credit  we'll require   hours of public service  and we'll amend the federal work study program  so that nearly   million will help more than   college students work in part time public service jobs each year  and we will not leave out the nearly   million young americans who are out of school and out of work  instead  we'll use service to tighten their bond to the american family  and to put them on a pathway to success  we'll enlist them in a green job corps  so that disadvantaged young people can find useful work and gain skills in a growing industry  and we'll expand the youthbuild program  which puts young americans to work building affordable housing in america's poorest communities  giving them valuable skills and a chance to complete a high school education  today  there are   youthbuild slots   we'll expand that to   now i know what the cynics will say  i've heard from them all my life  these are the voices that will tell you   not just what you can't do   but what you won't do  americans won't come together   our allegiance doesn't go beyond our political party  region  or congregation  young americans won't serve their country   they're too selfish  or too lazy  this is the soft sell of the status quo  the voice that tells you to settle because settling isn't that bad  let me ask you to stop and consider this meeting that we're having  you go to the first school in the united states west of the mississippi to grant women the same rights and privileges as men  you go to a school that resolved in   that race would not be a factor in admission  these may be small changes on the vast canvas of history  but the america we live in is the sum total of that kind of courage  that spirit of progress  if it weren't for that kind of change  it wouldn't be possible for someone like me to stand here today to talk to you about the future of this country  you and i are at a place where somebody  at some point  decided that loving their community and their country meant doing something to change it  renewing that spirit starts with service  make no mistake  our destiny as americans is tied up with one another  if we are less respected in the world  then you will be less safe  if we keep paying dictators to fill up our gas tanks  then those oceans are going to rise  if we can't give our kids a world class education  then our economy is going to fall behind  and that's how it should be  it is time to recapture that sense of a common purpose  i am my brother's keeper  i am my sister's keeper  i'm tired of hearing about how america is on the wrong track   i want us to come together to put it on the right track  i'm tired of hearing about red america and blue america   i want to lead a united states of america  i'm tired of talking about what we can't do  or won't do  or won't even try   i want all of us to stand up and to start reaching for what is possible  that's what history calls us to do  because loving your country shouldn't just mean watching fireworks on the  th of july  loving your country must mean accepting your responsibility to do your part to change it  and if you do stand up  i promise you that your life will be richer  and our country will be stronger  we need your service  right now  in this moment   our moment   in history  i'm not going to tell you what your role should be  that's for you to discover  but i am going to ask you to play your part  ask you to stand up  ask you to put your foot firmly into the current of history  i am asking you to change history's course  and if i have the fortune to be your president  decades from now   when the memory of this or that policy has faded  and when the words that we will speak in the next few years are long forgotten   i hope you remember this as a moment when your own story and the american story came together  and history bent once more in the direction of justice "], ["obama1", "this is a pivotal moment in our history  our security is threatened  our nation is at war  our planet is in peril  the strength  standing and leadership in the world that so many generations of americans have fought and worked for is at stake  iowans understand this  everywhere i go   from sioux city to des moines to davenport   i'm asked about the changes we need to make in our foreign policy  you understand that in a world of stateless terrorists and spreading technology  our own security and prosperity is tied to what happens around the world  you want to be proud of what america stands for  and you know that america is stronger   and safer   when our policies reflect our core values  this came up in our recent debate here in des moines  i was asked how i plan to change our foreign policy  even as i'm advised by members of previous administrations  i'm thankful to be joined on this stage today by two of those advisors   tony lake and susan rice  as well as general scott gration and senator steve warnstadt  and i look forward to drawing on all of the talent that i can get when i am president of the united states   because unlike george bush  i'm not going to demand an ideological or loyalty test for my advisors  but the answer to the question is simple  there are moments in history when it is not enough to fall back on conventional ways of doing things  because the threats we face are unconventional  there are moments when we're called to stand up for what is right even if it's not popular  because that's what makes us stronger and safer  there are moments when new challenges demand new american leadership  this is one of those moments  i am running for president to offer that leadership  and i welcome the support of all who will help me chart this course  i am running to do more than end a war in iraq   i am running to change the mindset that got us into war  it's easy for us to lay all of the problems of the world at george bush's doorstep  his judgments will be subject to the harsh light of history  and the verdict will not be kind  but the question is what comes next  because we also have to change a conventional way of thinking about foreign policy that values time spent in washington over timely judgments  posturing over pragmatism  and fear of looking weak over the conviction to get things right  here  i ask you to look no further than my record  george bush did not take us to war alone  congress gave him that authority when it voted for a resolution with the simple title   a resolution to authorize the use of united states armed forces against iraq  i opposed the war  and spoke out against it in   when it was not politically popular  i said we needed to finish the job in afghanistan  and that invading and occupying a country that had nothing to do with   was the wrong way to respond to the unconventional challenge posed by al qaeda and islamic extremism  today  we see the disastrous results of the decision to go to war  still  we have not shown that we are learning the right lessons  on iraq  we hear that the surge is succeeding  let me be clear  the surge is not the solution to iraq's problems because it is not achieving the political benchmarks that were the stated purpose of our troop increase  you cannot end a civil war unless the warring parties resolve their differences  and only a removal of our combat brigades will put meaningful pressure on the iraqis to do so  and the surge continues to focus our resources on the wrong war  just yesterday  we learned on the front page of the washington post that the u s  military is pressing for a quicker drawdown from iraq so we can salvage stability in afghanistan  six years after we took our eye off the ball in afghanistan   the origin of the   attacks   we still don't have our priorities straight  that's why it's time to stop funding a failed policy  to remove our combat brigades from iraq  and to increase our military  political  and economic commitment to afghanistan  that's what i spoke out for in   that's what i've called for in this campaign  and that's what i'll do as president  in iran  there is a conventional thinking that has prized bluster over common sense  earlier this year  while i was getting attacked for calling for direct diplomacy with iran's leaders  others were talking tough and voting for an amendment that calls for george bush to use our troops in iraq to counter iran  then we learned in a national intelligence estimate that iran suspended its nuclear weapons program in   in response to international pressure  now make no mistake   iran continues to pose a threat through its support for terrorism  nuclear know how  and threats toward israel  but the answer is not george bush's saber rattling   it's the diplomatic approach that i put forward when it was politically risky  as president  i will personally present iran with a choice   stop your dangerous behavior and there will be political and economic incentives  continue doing what you're doing and you will face further isolation  we need a president who is willing to talk to all nations   friend and foe  not talking doesn't make us look tough  it makes us look arrogant  it also makes it harder to get international support when we do need to pressure countries like iran  and opens the door to china and russia to fill the vacuum left by the absence of american leadership  we have to stop giving countries the excuse that america will not come to the table  we have to lead  and that's what i intend to do  when you elect our next president  you will choose someone to make those tough judgments on iraq  on iran  on how to restore america's standing  we know what we're going to get from the republican nominee  more bush cheney foreign policy  more support for open ended war in iraq  more saber rattling toward iran  more refusing to talk to countries we don't like  more exceptions and excuses made for torture  they even had a debate earlier this year where they argued about how much to expand guantanamo  when i'm the democratic nominee  i will offer a clear choice  my opponent won't be able to say that i ever supported the war in iraq  or that i don't support a clear timetable to bring our troops home  he won't be able to say that i voted to use our troops in iraq to counter iran  or that i support the bush cheney diplomacy of not talking to leaders we don't like  and he won't be able to say that i wavered on something as fundamental as whether or not it is ok for america to torture  because it is never ok  this isn't about drawing contrasts   it's about a change in our foreign policy that you can believe in  so when you consider who to caucus for  i ask you to consider my judgment and vision for new american leadership  leadership that brings our combat brigades out of iraq in   months  renews american diplomacy  finishes the fight in afghanistan  closes guantanamo  and leads the world against the common threats of the  st century   nuclear weapons and terrorism  climate change and poverty  genocide and disease  leadership that sends a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says   you matter to us  your future is our future  and our moment is now  it's a vision informed by three years serving on the senate foreign relations committee  where i have worked across the aisle with dick lugar to keep the world's most dangerous weapons away from terrorists  and introduced legislation to stop the war in iraq and the genocide in darfur  it's a vision informed by three years serving on the senate veterans' affairs committee  where i have seen firsthand the sacrifices of those who bear the burden of war  and fought to give them the care  benefits  and respect that they have earned  it's a vision informed by official travel overseas to africa  throughout the middle east  and across the former soviet union   where i have seen firsthand the unconventional threats of a terrorized city and the terrible danger of a loose anthrax vial  but where i also saw the yearning in the eyes of those faces who need an america that speaks to their hopes  not just their fears  it's a vision informed by my opposition to this war in iraq  and by the counsel i have received from leading experts like the people on this stage today  and it's a vision informed by knowing what it's like to live in the wider world  beyond the halls of power  of playing barefoot with children in indonesia who couldn't dream the same dreams that i could because they weren't american  of having a grandmother living in kenya without electricity or plumbing  of being born to a father who set out from a distant land in search of the light of hope offered by a dream called america  that is the experience that i will bring to the office  not the mindset of fear that we have been fed since     fear of looking weak  fear of new challenges  fear of the unknown  but rather hope that this moment of challenge can become a dawn of new opportunity  and the conviction to seize this opportunity   to recapture our strength  to overcome new threats  to reach for what's possible  to do this  we have to invite the american people into the discussion  and once more make our foreign policy a cause to unite us   not a wedge issue to divide us  that's why i have been clear and detailed in my proposals during this campaign  and that's why i'm pleased to join some of my advisors in an open discussion with iowans today "], ["obama1", "ten months ago  i stood on the steps of the old state capitol in springfield  illinois  and began an unlikely journey to change america  i did not run for the presidency to fulfill some long held ambition or because i believed it was somehow owed to me  i chose to run in this election   at this moment   because of what dr  king called  the fierce urgency of now  because we are at a defining moment in our history  our nation is at war  our planet is in peril  our health care system is broken  our economy is out of balance  our education system fails too many of our children  and our retirement system is in tatters  at this defining moment  we cannot wait any longer for universal health care  we cannot wait to fix our schools  we cannot wait for good jobs  and living wages  and pensions we can count on  we cannot wait to halt global warming  and we cannot wait to end this war in iraq  i chose to run because i believed that the size of these challenges had outgrown the capacity of our broken and divided politics to solve them  because i believed that americans of every political stripe were hungry for a new kind of politics  a politics that focused not just on how to win but why we should  a politics that focused on those values and ideals that we held in common as americans  a politics that favored common sense over ideology  straight talk over spin  most of all  i believed in the power of the american people to be the real agents of change in this country   because we are not as divided as our politics suggests  because we are a decent  generous people willing to work hard and sacrifice for future generations  and i was certain that if we could just mobilize our voices to challenge the special interests that dominate washington and challenge ourselves to reach for something better  there was no problem we couldn't solve   no destiny we couldn't fulfill  ten months later  iowa  you have vindicated that faith  you've come out in the blistering heat and the bitter cold not just to cheer  but to challenge   to ask the tough questions  to lift the hood and kick the tires  to serve as one place in america where someone who hasn't spent their life in the washington spotlight can get a fair hearing  you've earned the role you play in our democracy because no one takes it more seriously  and i believe that's true this year more than ever because  like me  you feel that same sense of urgency  all across this state  you've shared with me your stories  and all too often they've been stories of struggle and hardship  i've heard from seniors who were betrayed by ceos who dumped their pensions while pocketing bonuses  and from those who still can't afford their prescriptions because congress refused to negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price  i've met maytag workers who labored all their lives only to see their jobs shipped overseas  who now compete with their teenagers for  an hour jobs at wal mart  i've spoken with teachers who are working at donut shops after school just to make ends meet  who are still digging into their own pockets to pay for school supplies  just two weeks ago  i heard a young woman in cedar rapids who told me she only gets three hours of sleep because she works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't afford health care for a sister with cerebral palsy  she spoke not with self pity but with determination  and wonders why the government isn't doing more to help her afford the education that will allow her to live out her dreams  i've spoken to veterans who talk with pride about what they've accomplished in afghanistan and iraq  but who nevertheless think of those they've left behind and question the wisdom of our mission in iraq  the mothers weeping in my arms over the memories of their sons  the disabled or homeless vets who wonder why their service has been forgotten  and i've spoken to americans in every corner of the state  patriots all  who wonder why we have allowed our standing in the world to decline so badly  so quickly  they know this has not made us safer  they know that we must never negotiate out of fear  but that we must never fear to negotiate with our enemies as well as our friends  they are ashamed of abu graib and guantanamo and warrantless wiretaps and ambiguity on torture  they love their country and want its cherished values and ideals restored  it is precisely because you've experience these frustrations  and seen the cost of inaction in your own lives  that you understand why we can't afford to settle for the same old politics  you know that we can't afford to allow the insurance lobbyists to kill health care reform one more time  and the oil lobbyists to keep us addicted to fossil fuels because no one stood up and took their power away when they had the chance  you know that we can't afford four more years of the same divisive food fight in washington that's about scoring political points instead of solving problems  that's about tearing your opponents down instead of lifting this country up  we can't afford the same politics of fear that tells democrats that the only way to look tough on national security is to talk  act  and vote like george bush republicans  that invokes   as a way to scare up votes instead of a challenge that should unite all americans to defeat our real enemies  we can't afford to be so worried about losing the next election that we lose the battles we owe to the next generation  the real gamble in this election is playing the same washington game with the same washington players and expecting a different result  and that's a risk we can't take  not this year  not when the stakes are this high  in this election  it is time to turn the page  in seven days  it is time to stand for change  this has been our message since the beginning of this campaign  it was our message when we were down  and our message when we were up  and it must be catching on  because in these last few weeks  everyone is talking about change  but you can't at once argue that you're the master of a broken system in washington and offer yourself as the person to change it  you can't fall in line behind the conventional thinking on issues as profound as war and offer yourself as the leader who is best prepared to chart a new and better course for america  the truth is  you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience  mine is rooted in the real lives of real people and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change  i believe deeply in those words  but they are not mine  they were bill clinton's in   when washington insiders questioned his readiness to lead  my experience is rooted in the lives of the men and women on the south side of chicago who i fought for as an organizer when the local steel plant closed  it's rooted in the lives of the people i stood up for as a civil rights lawyer when they were denied opportunity on the job or justice at the voting booth because of what they looked like or where they came from  it's rooted in an understanding of how the world sees america that i gained from living  traveling  and having family beyond our shores   an understanding that led me to oppose this war in iraq from the start  it's experience rooted in the real lives of real people  and it's the kind of experience washington needs right now  there are others in this race who say that this kind of change sounds good  but that i'm not angry or confrontational enough to get it done  well  let me tell you something  iowa  i don't need any lectures on how to bring about change  because i haven't just talked about it on the campaign trail  i've fought for change all my life  i walked away from a job on wall street to bring job training to the jobless and after school programs to kids on the streets of chicago  i turned down the big money law firms to win justice for the powerless as a civil rights lawyer  i took on the lobbyists in illinois and brought democrats and republicans together to expand health care to   people and pass the first major campaign finance reform in twenty five years  and i did the same thing in washington when we passed the toughest lobbying reform since watergate  i'm the only candidate in this race who hasn't just talked about taking power away from lobbyists  i've actually done it  so if you want to know what kind of choices we'll make as president  you should take a look at the choices we made when we had the chance to bring about change that wasn't easy or convenient  that's the kind of change that's more than just rhetoric   that's change you can believe in  it's change that won't just come from more anger at washington or turning up the heat on republicans  there's no shortage of anger and bluster and bitter partisanship out there  we don't need more heat  we need more light  i've learned in my life that you can stand firm in your principles while still reaching out to those who might not always agree with you  and although the republican operatives in washington might not be interested in hearing what we have to say  i think republican and independent voters outside of washington are  that's the once in a generation opportunity we have in this election  for the first time in a long time  we have the chance to build a new majority of not just democrats  but independents and republicans who've lost faith in their washington leaders but want to believe again   who desperately want something new  we can change the electoral math that's been all about division and make it about addition   about building a coalition for change and progress that stretches through blue states and red states  that's how i won some of the reddest  most republican counties in illinois  that's why the polls show that i do best against the republicans running for president   because we're attracting more support from independents and republicans than any other candidate  that's how we'll win in november and that's how we'll change this country over the next four years  in the end  the argument we are having between the candidates in the last seven days is not just about the meaning of change  it's about the meaning of hope  some of my opponents appear scornful of the word  they think it speaks of naivete  passivity  and wishful thinking  but that's not what hope is  hope is not blind optimism  it's not ignoring the enormity of the task before us or the roadblocks that stand in our path  yes  the lobbyists will fight us  yes  the republican attack dogs will go after us in the general election  yes  the problems of poverty and climate change and failing schools will resist easy repair  i know   i've been on the streets  i've been in the courts  i've watched legislation die because the powerful held sway and good intentions weren't fortified by political will  and i've watched a nation get mislead into war because no one had the judgment or the courage to ask the hard questions before we sent our troops to fight  but i also know this  i know that hope has been the guiding force behind the most improbable changes this country has ever made  in the face of tyranny  it's what led a band of colonists to rise up against an empire  in the face of slavery  it's what fueled the resistance of the slave and the abolitionist  and what allowed a president to chart a treacherous course to ensure that the nation would not continue half slave and half free  in the face of war and depression  it's what led the greatest of generations to free a continent and heal a nation  in the face of oppression  it's what led young men and women to sit at lunch counters and brave fire hoses and march through the streets of selma and montgomery for freedom's cause  that's the power of hope   to imagine  and then work for  what had seemed impossible before  that's the change we seek  and that's the change you can stand for in seven days  we've already beaten odds that the cynics said couldn't be beaten  when we started ten months ago  they said we couldn't run a different kind of campaign  they said we couldn't compete without taking money from washington lobbyists  but you proved them wrong when we raised more small donations from more americans than any other campaign in history   br  they said we couldn't be successful if we didn't have the full support of the establishment in washington  but you proved them wrong when we built a grassroots movement that could forever change the face of american politics  they said we wouldn't have a chance in this campaign unless we resorted to the same old negative attacks  but we resisted  even when we were written off  and ran a positive campaign that pointed out real differences and rejected the politics of slash and burn  and now  in seven days  you have a chance once again to prove the cynics wrong  in seven days  what was improbable has the chance to beat what washington said was inevitable  and that's why in these last weeks  washington is fighting back with everything it has   with attack ads and insults  with distractions and dishonesty  with millions of dollars from outside groups and undisclosed donors to try and block our path  we've seen this script many times before  but i know that this time can be different  because i know that when the american people believe in something  it happens  if you believe  then we can tell the lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in washington are over  if you believe  then we can stop making promises to america's workers and start delivering   jobs that pay  health care that's affordable  pensions you can count on  and a tax cut for working americans instead of the companies who send their jobs overseas   if you believe  we can offer a world class education to every child  and pay our teachers more  and make college dreams a reality for every american  if you believe  we can save this planet and end our dependence on foreign oil  if you believe  we can end this war  close guantanamo  restore our standing  renew our diplomacy  and once again respect the constitution of the united states of america   that's the future within our reach  that's what hope is   that thing inside us that insists  despite all evidence to the contrary  that something better is waiting for us around the corner  but only if we're willing to work for it and fight for it  to shed our fears and our doubts and our cynicism  to glory in the task before us of remaking this country block by block  precinct by precinct  county by county  state by state  there is a moment in the life of every generation when  if we are to make our mark on history  this spirit must break through this is the moment  this is our time  and if you will stand with me in seven days   if you will stand for change so that our children have the same chance that somebody gave us  if you'll stand to keep the american dream alive for those who still hunger for opportunity and thirst for justice  if you're ready to stop settling for what the cynics tell you you must accept  and finally reach for what you know is possible  then we will win this caucus  we will win this election  we will change the course of history  and the real journey   to heal a nation and repair the world   will have truly begun  thank you "], ["obama1", "thank you  iowa  you know  they said this day would never come  they said our sights were set too high  they said this country was too divided  too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose  but on this january night   at this defining moment in history   you have done what the cynics said we couldn't do  you have done what the state of new hampshire can do in five days  you have done what america can do in this new year    in lines that stretched around schools and churches  in small towns and big cities  you came together as democrats  republicans and independents to stand up and say that we are one nation  we are one people  and our time for change has come  you said the time has come to move beyond the bitterness and pettiness and anger that's consumed washington  to end the political strategy that's been all about division and instead make it about addition   to build a coalition for change that stretches through red states and blue states  because that's how we'll win in november  and that's how we'll finally meet the challenges that we face as a nation  we are choosing hope over fear  we're choosing unity over division  and sending a powerful message that change is coming to america  you said the time has come to tell the lobbyists who think their money and their influence speak louder than our voices that they don't own this government  we do  and we are here to take it back  the time has come for a president who will be honest about the choices and the challenges we face  who will listen to you and learn from you even when we disagree  who won't just tell you what you want to hear  but what you need to know  and in new hampshire  if you give me the same chance that iowa did tonight  i will be that president for america  thank you  i'll be a president who finally makes health care affordable and available to every single american the same way i expanded health care in illinois   by by bringing democrats and republicans together to get the job done  i'll be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and put a middle class tax cut into the pockets of the working americans who deserve it  i'll be a president who harnesses the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all  and i'll be a president who ends this war in iraq and finally brings our troops home  who restores our moral standing  who understands that   is not a way to scare up votes  but a challenge that should unite america and the world against the common threats of the twenty first century  common threats of terrorism and nuclear weapons  climate change and poverty  genocide and disease  tonight  we are one step closer to that vision of america because of what you did here in iowa  and so i'd especially like to thank the organizers and the precinct captains  the volunteers and the staff who made this all possible  and while i'm at it  on  thank yous  i think it makes sense for me to thank the love of my life  the rock of the obama family  the closer on the campaign trail  give it up for michelle obama  i know you didn't do this for me  you did this you did this because you believed so deeply in the most american of ideas   that in the face of impossible odds  people who love this country can change it  i know this i know this because while i may be standing here tonight  i'll never forget that my journey began on the streets of chicago doing what so many of you have done for this campaign and all the campaigns here in iowa   organizing  and working  and fighting to make people's lives just a little bit better  i know how hard it is  it comes with little sleep  little pay  and a lot of sacrifice  there are days of disappointment  but sometimes  just sometimes  there are nights like this   a night a night that  years from now  when we've made the changes we believe in  when more families can afford to see a doctor  when our children when malia and sasha and your children inherit a planet that's a little cleaner and safer  when the world sees america differently  and america sees itself as a nation less divided and more united  you'll be able to look back with pride and say that this was the moment when it all began  this was the moment when the improbable beat what washington always said was inevitable  this was the moment when we tore down barriers that have divided us for too long   when we rallied people of all parties and ages to a common cause  when we finally gave americans who'd never participated in politics a reason to stand up and to do so  this was the moment when we finally beat back the politics of fear  and doubt  and cynicism  the politics where we tear each other down instead of lifting this country up  this was the moment  years from now  you'll look back and you'll say that this was the moment   this was the place   where america remembered what it means to hope  for many months  we've been teased  even derided for talking about hope  but we always knew that hope is not blind optimism  it's not ignoring the enormity of the task ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path  it's not sitting on the sidelines or shirking from a fight  hope is that thing inside us that insists  despite all evidence to the contrary  that something better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it  and to work for it  and to fight for it  hope is what i saw in the eyes of the young woman in cedar rapids who works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't afford health care for a sister who's ill  a young woman who still believes that this country will give her the chance to live out her dreams  hope is what i heard in the voice of the new hampshire woman who told me that she hasn't been able to breathe since her nephew left for iraq  who still goes to bed each night praying for his safe return  hope is what led a band of colonists to rise up against an empire  what led the greatest of generations to free a continent and heal a nation  what led young women and young men to sit at lunch counters and brave fire hoses and march through selma and montgomery for freedom's cause  hope hope is what led me here today   with a father from kenya  a mother from kansas  and a story that could only happen in the united states of america  hope is the bedrock of this nation  the belief that our destiny will not be written for us  but by us  by all those men and women who are not content to settle for the world as it is  who have the courage to remake the world as it should be  that is what we started here in iowa  and that is the message we can now carry to new hampshire and beyond  the same message we had when we were up and when we were down  the one that can change this country brick by brick  block by block  calloused hand by calloused hand   that together  ordinary people can do extraordinary things  because we are not a collection of red states and blue states  we are the united states of america  and at this moment  in this election  we are ready to believe again  thank you  iowa "], ["obama1", "thank you  new hampshire  i love you back  thank you  thank you  well  thank you so much  i am still fired up and ready to go   applause  thank you  thank you  well  first of all  i want to congratulate senator clinton on a hard fought victory here in new hampshire  she did an outstanding job  give her a big round of applause   applause  you know  a few weeks ago  no one imagined that we'd have accomplished what we did here tonight in new hampshire  no one could have imagined it  for most of this campaign  we were far behind  we always knew our climb would be steep  but in record numbers  you came out  and you spoke up for change  and with your voices and your votes  you made it clear that at this moment  in this election  there is something happening in america   applause  there is something happening when men and women in des moines and davenport  in lebanon and concord  come out in the snows of january to wait in lines that stretch block after block because they believe in what this country can be  there is something happening  there's something happening when americans who are young in age and in spirit  who've never participated in politics before  turn out in numbers we have never seen because they know in their hearts that this time must be different  there's something happening when people vote not just for party that they belong to  but the hopes that they hold in common  and whether we are rich or poor  black or white  latino or asian  whether we hail from iowa or new hampshire  nevada or south carolina  we are ready to take this country in a fundamentally new direction  that's what's happening in america right now  change is what's happening in america  you  all of you who are here tonight  all who put so much heart and soul and work into this campaign  you can be the new majority who can lead this nation out of a long political darkness  democrats  independents and republicans who are tired of the division and distraction that has clouded washington  who know that we can disagree without being disagreeable  who understand that  if we mobilize our voices to challenge the money and influence that stood in our way and challenge ourselves to reach for something better  there is no problem we cannot solve  there is no destiny that we cannot fulfill  our new american majority can end the outrage of unaffordable  unavailable health care in our time  we can bring doctors and patients  workers and businesses  democrats and republicans together  and we can tell the drug and insurance industry that  while they get a seat at the table  they don't get to buy every chair  not this time  not now   applause  our new majority can end the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas and put a middle class tax cut in the pockets of working americans who deserve it  we can stop sending our children to schools with corridors of shame and start putting them on a pathway to success  we can stop talking about how great teachers are and start rewarding them for their greatness by giving them more pay and more support  we can do this with our new majority  we can harness the ingenuity of farmers and scientists  citizens and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil and save our planet from a point of no return  and when i am president of the united states  we will end this war in iraq and bring our troops home   applause  we will end this war in iraq  we will bring our troops home  we will finish the job   we will finish the job against al qaida in afghanistan  we will care for our veterans  we will restore our moral standing in the world  and we will never use   as a way to scare up votes  because it is not a tactic to win an election  it is a challenge that should unite america and the world against the common threats of the  st century  terrorism and nuclear weapons  climate change and poverty  genocide and disease  all of the candidates in this race share these goals  all of the candidates in this race have good ideas and all are patriots who serve this country honorably   applause  but the reason our campaign has always been different  the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago is because it's not just about what i will do as president  it is also about what you  the people who love this country  the citizens of the united states of america  can do to change it  that's what this election is all about  that's why tonight belongs to you  it belongs to the organizers  and the volunteers  and the staff who believed in this journey and rallied so many others to join the cause  we know the battle ahead will be long  but always remember that  no matter what obstacles stand in our way  nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change  we have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics  and they will only grow louder and more dissonant in the weeks and months to come  we've been asked to pause for a reality check  we've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope  but in the unlikely story that is america  there has never been anything false about hope   applause  for when we have faced down impossible odds  when we've been told we're not ready or that we shouldn't try or that we can't  generations of americans have responded with a simple creed that sums up the spirit of a people  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can  it was a creed written into the founding documents that declared the destiny of a nation  yes  we can  it was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed a trail towards freedom through the darkest of nights  yes  we can  it was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness  yes  we can  it was the call of workers who organized  women who reached for the ballot  a president who chose the moon as our new frontier  and a king who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the promised land  yes  we can  to justice and equality  yes  we can  to opportunity and prosperity  yes  we can heal this nation  yes  we can repair this world  yes  we can  and so  tomorrow  as we take the campaign south and west  as we learn that the struggles of the textile workers in spartanburg are not so different than the plight of the dishwasher in las vegas  that the hopes of the little girl who goes to the crumbling school in dillon are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of l a  we will remember that there is something happening in america  that we are not as divided as our politics suggest  that we are one people  we are one nation  and  together  we will begin the next great chapter in the american story  with three words that will ring from coast to coast  from sea to shining sea  yes  we can  thank you  new hampshire  thank you  thank you "], ["obama1", "this morning  we woke up to bad news from wall street  for the second day in a row  the global stock market has continued to plunge as the world continues to fear that the united states government won't do enough to prevent a recession  we hope that the rate cut announced this morning will restore some confidence and stop the damage  but the fear remains  it's a fear that hasn't just confined itself to those who nervously watch the tickers or scan the headlines of the financial section  but one that i have seen on the faces of working americans in every corner of this country long before anxiety ever hit wall street  i've seen it in the faces of families who are being forced to foreclose on their dream because an unscrupulous lender tricked them into buying a home they couldn't afford just to pocket a profit  i've seen it in the faces of maytag workers who labored all their lives only to see their jobs shipped overseas  who now compete with their teenagers for  an hour jobs at wal mart  and i've seen it in the face of a young woman who told me she only gets three hours of sleep because she works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't afford health care for a sister who's ill  in the last several months  their fears have grown worse and are now shared by more and more americans  what started as a crisis in the housing market has now spilled over to the rest of the economy  banks are facing a credit crunch  leaving businesses with less money to invest and more americans unable to get loans  joblessness rose more last month than at any time since just after   and oil reached   a barrel  people have less money to spend  higher bills to pay  and fewer opportunities for work  for years  we were warned this might happen  but washington did what washington does   it looked the other way  it rewarded lenders and lobbyists with whatever they asked for while ignoring the voices of working people who needed help most  and all the while  we've been led by george w  bush   a president who's done more to contribute to this country's widening inequality than anyone since herbert hoover  a president whose tax breaks for wealthy americans who didn't need them and didn't ask for them have only encouraged the mindset in washington and on wall street that  what's good for me is good enough  that's why it's no surprise that after months and months of watching families struggle to get by in this economy  george bush finally offered a stimulus plan last week that neglects   million workers and seniors who need our help the most  the very people who are most likely to spend and give our economy the boost it needs right now  well george bush's economic plans haven't worked before and they're not going to start working now  more importantly  they don't reflect who we are as americans  we haven't come this far because we practice survival of the fittest  america is america because we strive for survival of the nation   a nation where no one is left behind and everyone has a chance to achieve their dreams  that's who we are  and that's who we can be again at this defining moment  this isn't an issue i found along the campaign trail  i introduced legislation to stop mortgage fraud and predatory lending almost two years ago  i called for a middle class tax cut back in september that would put money into the pockets of over   of working americans  that would eliminate income taxes for seniors making less than   that would give a tax credit to struggling homeowners  and that's why when i announced my economic stimulus package the other week  i called for immediate tax relief for working families and seniors   because they shouldn't have to wait another day for washington to act  they need our help right now  we should send each working family a   tax cut and each senior a   supplement to their social security check  and if the economy continues to decline in the coming weeks  we should do it again  this is the quickest way to help people pay their bills and get them to start spending  we should also immediately make unemployment insurance available for a longer period of time and for more people who are facing job losses  and we should make sure it benefits part time and non traditional workers  something that will particularly help women  african americans and latinos  we should help those facing foreclosure refinance their mortgages and stay in their homes  and we should provide direct relief to victims of mortgage fraud  and we should provide assistance to state and local governments so that they don't slash critical services like health care or education  of course  it's easy to propose plans and policies when you're on the campaign trail  you can make all sorts of promises and tell people what they want to hear when they want to hear it  but in this time of economic anxiety and uncertainty  what this country needs most is a president who says what he means and means what he says  a president who won't just do what's right when the politics are easy  but when the politics are hard  a president who's not just in it to win it  but in it for you  in the debate last night  we spent some time talking about the economy  and one of the things i brought up that concerned me was that when senator clinton first released her economic stimulus plan  she didn't think that workers or seniors needed immediate tax relief  she thought it could wait until things got worse  five days later  the economy didn't really change  but the politics apparently did  because she changed her plan to look just like mine  it reminds me of what happened when we started debating the credit card industry's bankruptcy bill   a bill that would make it much harder for working families to climb out of debt  believe it or not  senator clinton said again last night that even though she voted for the bill  she was glad it didn't pass  i know you can get away with this in washington  but most of us know that if you don't want to see a bill pass  there's a pretty easy option available   you can vote against it  and we've heard her say the same kind of thing about nafta and china trade  agreements that sent millions of american jobs   thousands from this very state   overseas  because only in washington could senator clinton say that nafta led to economic improvement up until she started running for president  now she says we need a time out on trade  no one knows when this time out will end  maybe after the election  the point is   this is exactly the kind of politics we can't afford right now  not when the stakes are this high  not when the economy is this fragile  not when so many banks are foreclosing on people's dreams  we can't afford a president whose positions change with the politics of the moment  we need a president who knows that being ready on day one means getting it right from day one  and south carolina  if you give me the chance  that's the kind of president i'll be  in my twenty five years of public service  my positions haven't changed when the politics got hard  and neither will the policies i pursue as president  i started my career as a community organizer on the streets of chicago  fighting joblessness and poverty when the local steel plant closed  i provided tax relief for working families as a state senator in illinois  and when i am president  i'll take away the breaks that washington gives to companies who ship our jobs overseas  and give them to companies who create the jobs of the future right here in america  i won't wait to raise the minimum wage every ten years   i will raise it to keep pace every year so that workers don't fall behind  i'll take on the credit card companies who are profiting by driving working families into debt  and i'll make sure that ceos can't dump your pension with one hand while they collect a bonus with the other  that's an outrage  and it's time we had a president who knows it's an outrage  on health care  i know what it takes to expand coverage to the uninsured  in illinois  i brought democrats and republicans together to expand health care to   children and parents  and when i'm president  i'll do more to cut costs for families and businesses than anyone in this race  and i'll pass universal health care not twenty years from now  not ten years from now  but by the end of my first term in office  and when it comes to taking away the power of lobbyists and special interests  i'm the only candidate in this race who's actually done it  in illinois i passed the first major ethics reform in twenty five years  in washington i helped pass the strongest lobbying reform in a generation   we banned gifts from lobbyists  meals with lobbyists  subsidized travel on fancy jets  and for the first time in history  we forced lobbyists to tell the american public who they're raising money from and who in congress they're funneling it to  last night senator clinton defended lobbyists again  who she has said represent real americans  well let me tell you   if you really believe that lobbyists represent real americans  then you don't  washington lobbyists haven't funded my campaign  they won't run my white house  and they will not drown out the voices of working americans when i am president  we know the road ahead will be difficult  none of the problems we face will be easy to solve and change will not happen overnight  it will take a new spirit of cooperation and sacrifice  it will require each of us to remind ourselves that we rise and fall as one nation  and that a country in which only a few prosper is antithetical to our ideals and our democracy  and it will take a president who can rally americans of different views and backgrounds to this common cause  i'm reminded every day that i am not a perfect man  and i will not be a perfect president  but i can promise you this   i will always say what i mean and mean what i say  i will be honest about the challenges we face  and most importantly  i will wake up every single day ready to listen to you  and work for you  and fight for you not just when it's easy  but when it's hard  that's what i did for those men and women on the streets of chicago  that's what i've done over the last decade for the working families of illinois  and that's what i will do for the american people if you give me the chance to lead this country  thank you "], ["obama1", "thank you  south carolina   cheers  applause   chants of  yes  we can  yes  we can  thank you  thank you   continued chants of  yes  we can  thank you  everybody  thank you  thank you  south carolina   cheers  applause  thank you  thank you  south carolina  thank you to the rock of my life  michelle obama   cheers  applause  thank you to malia and sasha obama  who haven't seen their daddy in a week   cheers  applause  thank you to pete skidmore for his outstanding service to our country and being such a great supporter of this campaign   cheers  applause  you know  over two weeks ago we saw the people of iowa proclaim that our time for change has come   cheers  applause  but there were those who doubted this country's desire for something new  who said iowa was a fluke  not to be repeated again  well  tonight the cynics who believed that what began in the snows of iowa was just an illusion were told a different story by the good people of south carolina   cheers  applause  after four great contests in every corner of this country  we have the most votes  the most delegates    cheers  applause    and the most diverse coalition of americans that we've seen in a long  long time   cheers  applause  you can see it in the faces here tonight  there are young and old  rich and poor  they are black and white  latino and asian and native american   cheers  applause  they are democrats from des moines and independents from concord and  yes  some republicans from rural nevada  and we've got young people all across this country who've never had a reason to participate until now   cheers  applause  and in nine days  in nine short days  nearly half the nation will have the chance to join us in saying that we are tired of business as usual in washington   cheers  applause  we are hungry for change  and we are ready to believe again   cheers  applause   chants of  we want change  we want change  but if there's anything  though  that we've been reminded of since iowa  it's that the kind of change we seek will not come easy  now  partly because we have fine candidates in this field  fierce competitors who are worthy of our respect and our admiration    applause    and as contentious as this campaign may get  we have to remember that this is a contest for the democratic nomination and that all of us share an abiding desire to end the disastrous policies of the current administration   cheers  applause  but there are real differences between the candidates  we are looking for more than just a change of party in the white house  we're looking to fundamentally change the status quo in washington   cheers  applause  it's a status quo that extends beyond any particular party  and right now that status quo is fighting back with everything it's got  with the same old tactics that divide and distract us from solving the problems people face  whether those problems are health care that folks can't afford or a mortgage they cannot pay  so this will not be easy  make no mistake about what we're up against  we're up against the belief that it's all right for lobbyists to dominate our government  that they are just part of the system in washington  but we know that the undue influence of lobbyists is part of the problem  and this election is our chance to say that we are not going to let them stand in our way anymore   cheers  applause  we're up against the conventional thinking that says your ability to lead as president comes from longevity in washington or proximity to the white house  but we know that real leadership is about candor and judgment and the ability to rally americans from all walks of life around a common purpose  a higher purpose   cheers  applause  we're up against decades of bitter partisanship that cause politicians to demonize their opponents instead of coming together to make college affordable or energy cleaner  it's the kind of partisanship where you're not even allowed to say that a republican had an idea  even if it's one you never agreed with  that's the kind of politics that is bad for our party  it is bad for our country  and this is our chance to end it once and for all   cheers  applause  we're up against the idea that it's acceptable to say anything and do anything to win an election  but we know that this is exactly what's wrong with our politics  this is why people don't believe what their leaders say anymore  this is why they tune out  and this election is our chance to give the american people a reason to believe again   cheers  applause  but let me say this  south carolina  what we've seen in these last weeks is that we're also up against forces that are not the fault of any one campaign but feed the habits that prevent us from being who we want to be as a nation  it's a politics that uses religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon  a politics that tells us that we have to think  act  and even vote within the confines of the categories that supposedly define us  the assumption that young people are apathetic  the assumption that republicans won't cross over  the assumption that the wealthy care nothing for the poor and that the poor don't vote  the assumption that african americans can't support the white candidate  whites can't support the african american candidate  blacks and latinos cannot come together  we are here tonight to say that that is not the america we believe in   cheers  applause   chants of  yes  we can  yes  we can  i did not travel around this state over the last year and see a white south carolina or a black south carolina  i saw south carolina    cheers  applause    because in the end  we're not up just against the ingrained and destructive habits of washington  we're also struggling with our own doubts  our own fears  our own cynicism  the change we seek has always required great struggle and great sacrifice  and so this is a battle in our own hearts and minds about what kind of country we want and how hard we're willing to work for it  so let me remind you tonight that change will not be easy  change will take time  there will be setbacks and false starts  and sometimes we'll make mistakes  but as hard as it may seem  we cannot lose hope  because there are people all across this great nation who are counting on us  who can't afford another four years without health care   cheers  they can't afford another four years without good schools   cheers  they can't afford another four years without decent wages because our leaders couldn't come together and get it done  theirs are the stories and voices we carry on from south carolina   the mother who can't get medicaid to cover all the needs of her sick child  she needs us to pass a health care plan that cuts costs and makes health care available and affordable for every single american  that's what she's looking for   cheers  applause  the teacher who works another shift at dunkin' donuts after school just to make ends meet   she needs us to reform our education system so that she gets better pay and more support and that students get the resources that they need to achieve their dreams   cheers  applause  the maytag worker who's now competing with his own teenager for a  an hour job at the local wal mart because the factory he gave his life to shut its doors   he needs us to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working americans who deserve it    cheers  applause    and put them in the pockets of struggling homeowners who are having a tough time  and looking after seniors who should retire with dignity and respect  that woman who told me that she hasn't been able to breathe since the day her nephew left for iraq  or the soldier who doesn't know his child because he's on his third or fourth or even fifth tour of duty   they need us to come together and put an end to a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged   cheers  applause  so understand this  south carolina  the choice in this election is not between regions or religions or genders  it's not about rich versus poor  young versus old  and it is not about black versus white   cheers  applause  this election is about the past versus the future   cheers  applause  it's about whether we settle for the same divisions and distractions and drama that passes for politics today or whether we reach for a politics of common sense and innovation  a politics of shared sacrifice and shared prosperity  there are those who will continue to tell us that we can't do this  that we can't have what we're looking for  that we can't have what we want  that we're peddling false hopes  but here's what i know  i know that when people say we can't overcome all the big money and influence in washington  i think of that elderly woman who sent me a contribution the other day  an envelope that had a money order for      cheers  applause    along with a verse of scripture tucked inside the envelope  so don't tell us change isn't possible  that woman knows change is possible   cheers  applause  when i hear the cynical talk that blacks and whites and latinos can't join together and work together  i'm reminded of the latino brothers and sisters i organized with and stood with and fought with side by side for jobs and justice on the streets of chicago  so don't tell us change can't happen   cheers  applause  when i hear that we'll never overcome the racial divide in our politics  i think about that republican woman who used to work for strom thurmond  who's now devoted to educating inner city children  and who went out into the streets of south carolina and knocked on doors for this campaign  don't tell me we can't change   cheers  applause  yes  we can  yes  we can change   chants of  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can   continued chants of  yes  we can  yes  we can heal this nation  yes  we can seize our future  and as we leave this great state with a new wind at our backs  and we take this journey across this great country  a country we love  with the message we've carried from the plains of iowa to the hills of new hampshire  from the nevada desert to the south carolina coast  the same message we had when we were up and when we were down  that out of many we are one  that while we breathe we will hope  and where we are met with cynicism and doubt and fear and those who tell us that we can't  we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of the american people in three simple words  yes  we can  thank you  south carolina  i love you   cheers  applause "], ["obama1", "thank you congressman kennedy and caroline and senator kennedy for your words  your support  and the service you've rendered to this country  i stand here today with a great deal of humility  i know what your support means  i know the cherished place the kennedy family holds in the hearts of the american people  and that is as it should be  because the kennedy family  more than any other  has always stood for what's best about the democratic party  and about america  that each of us can make a difference and all of us ought to try  that no frontier is beyond our reach when we're united  and not divided  and that those of us who are not content to settle for the world as it is  can remake the world as it should be   that together  we  can seek a newer world  no one embodies this proud legacy more than the people we've just heard from  for a woman who was introduced to america in the spotlight  caroline has worked out of public view to bring about change in our communities  whether it's her work with new york city's public schools or the profile in courage award or through books on politics  civil rights and history  caroline has been a quiet force for change in this country  and it's an honor to have her support  it's also an honor to have congressman kennedy's support  he's been a real leader in the fight to make sure every american has equal access to the quality mental health care they need  it's one of the great civil rights issues of our time  and it's an issue i'm proud to have worked on with him  he's not just part of the next generation of kennedy leaders  he's part of the next generation of democratic and american leaders  and i look forward to fighting by his side in the months and years to come  and it is a special honor and privilege to have the support of the congressman's father  senator kennedy  in the year i was born  president kennedy let out word that the torch had been passed to a new generation of americans  he was right  it had  it was passed to his youngest brother  from the battles of the  s to the battles of today  he has carried that torch  lighting the way for all who share his american ideals  it's a torch he's carried as a champion for working americans  a fierce proponent of universal health care  and a tireless advocate for giving every child in this country a quality education  it's a torch he's carried as the lion of the senate  a man whose mastery of the issues and command of the levers of government   whose determined leadership and deft political skills   are matched only by his ability to tell a good story  ted kennedy stands apart from the prevailing wisdom in washington that has reduced politics to a game of tactics and transactions  in which no principle is beyond sacrifice  and his public life is a testimony to what can be achieved when you focus on lifting our country up  rather than tearing political opponents down  few public servants in our nation's history have had such a profound influence on the course of our nation  few leaders in this country have more experience in how to bring about real change  and few have better judgment about where we're headed as a party and a people  today isn't just about politics for me  it's personal  i was too young to remember john kennedy and i was just a child when robert kennedy ran for president  but in the stories i heard growing up  i saw how my grandparents and mother spoke about them  and about that period in our nation's life   as a time of great hope and achievement  and i think my own sense of what's possible in this country comes in part from what they said america was like in the days of john and robert kennedy  i believe that's true for millions of americans  i've seen it in offices in this city where portraits of john and robert hang on office walls or collections of their speeches sit on bookshelves  and i've seen it in my travels all across this country  because no matter where i go  or who i talk to  one thing i can say for certain is that the dream has never died  the dream lives on in the older folks i meet who remember what america once was  and know what america can be once again  it lives on in the young people who've only seen john or robert kennedy on tv  but are ready to answer their call  it lives on in those americans who refuse to be deterred by the scale of the challenges we face  who know  as president kennedy said at this university  that  no problem of human destiny is beyond human beings  and it lives on in those americans   young and old  rich and poor  black and white  latino and asian   who are tired of a politics that divides us and want to recapture the sense of common purpose that we had when john kennedy was president  that is the dream we hold in our hearts  that is the kind of leadership we need in this country  and that is the kind of leadership i intend to offer as president  so make no mistake  the choice in this election is not between regions or religions or genders  it's not about rich versus poor  young versus old  and it is not about black versus white  it's about the past versus the future  it's about whether we're going to seize this moment to write the next great american story  so someday we can tell our children that this was the time when we healed our nation  this was the time when we repaired our world  and this was the time when we renewed the america that has led generations of weary travelers from all over the world to find opportunity  and liberty  and hope on our doorstep  one of these travelers was my father  i barely knew him  but when  after his death  i finally took my first trip to his tiny village in kenya and asked my grandmother if there was anything left from him  she opened a trunk and took out a stack of letters  which she handed to me  there were more than thirty of them  all handwritten by my father  all addressed to colleges and universities across america  all filled with the hope of a young man who dreamed of more for his life  and his prayer was answered when he was brought over to study in this country  but what i learned much later is that part of what made it possible for him to come here was an effort by the young senator from massachusetts at the time  john f  kennedy  and by a grant from the kennedy foundation to help kenyan students pay for travel  so it is partly because of their generosity that my father came to this country  and because he did  i stand before you today   inspired by america's past  filled with hope for america's future  and determined to do my part in writing our next great chapter  so i'm asking for your hands  i'm asking for your help  and i'm asking for your hearts  and if you will stand with me in the days to come   if you will stand for change so that our children have the same chance that somebody gave us  if you'll stand to keep the american dream alive for those who still hunger for opportunity and thirst for justice  if you're ready to stop settling for what the cynics tell you you must accept  and finally reach for what you know is possible  then we will win these primaries  we will win this election  we will change the course of history  and light a new torch for change in this country   and  the glow from that fire can truly light the world "], ["obama1", "tonight  for the seventh long year  the american people heard a state of the union that didn't reflect the america we see  and didn't address the challenges we face  but what it did do was give us an urgent reminder of why it's so important to turn the page on the failed politics and policies of the past  and change the status quo in washington so we can finally start making progress for ordinary americans  tonight's state of the union was full of the same empty rhetoric the american people have come to expect from this president  we heard president bush say he'd do something to cut down on special interest earmarks  but we know these earmarks have skyrocketed under his administration  we heard the president say he wants to make tax cuts for the wealthiest americans permanent  when we know that at a time of war and economic hardship  the last thing we need is a permanent tax cut for americans who don't need them and weren't even asking for them  what we need is a middle class tax cut  and that's exactly what i will provide as president  we heard the president say he has a stimulus plan to boost our economy  but we know his plan leaves out seniors and fails to expand unemployment insurance  and we know it was george bush's washington that let the banks and financial institutions run amok  and take our economy down this dangerous road  what we need to do now is put more money in the pockets of workers and seniors  and expand unemployment insurance for more people and more time  and i have a plan that to do just that  and finally  tonight we heard president bush say that the surge in iraq is working  when we know that's just not true  yes  our valiant soldiers have helped reduce the violence  five soldiers gave their lives today in this cause  and we mourn their loss and pray for their families  but let there be no doubt   the iraqi government has failed to seize the moment to reach the compromises necessary for an enduring peace  that was what we were told the surge was all about  so the only way we're finally going to pressure the iraqis to reconcile and take responsibility for their future is to immediately begin the responsible withdrawal of our combat brigades so that we can bring all of our combat troops home  but another reason we need to begin this withdrawal immediately is because this war has not made us safer  i opposed this war from the start in part because i was concerned that it would take our eye off al qaeda and distract us from finishing the job in afghanistan  sadly  that's what happened  it's time to heed our military commanders by increasing our commitment to afghanistan  and it's time to protect the american people by taking the fight to al qaeda  tonight was president bush's last state of the union  and i do not believe history will judge his administration kindly  but i also believe the failures of the last seven years stem not just from any single policy  but from a broken politics in washington  a politics that says it's ok to demonize your political opponents when we should be coming together to solve problems  a politics that puts wall street ahead of main street  ignoring the reality that our fates are intertwined  a politics that accepts lobbyists as part of the system in washington  instead of recognizing how much they're a part of the problem  and a politics of fear and ideology instead of hope and common sense  i believe a new kind of politics is possible  and i believe it is necessary  because the american people can't afford another four years without health care  decent wages  or an end to this war  the woman who's going to college and working the night shift to pay her sister's medical bills can't afford to wait  the maytag workers who are now competing with their teenagers for   an hour jobs at wall mart can't afford to wait  and the woman who told me she hasn't been able to breathe since her nephew left for iraq can't afford to wait  each year  as we watch the state of the union  we see half the chamber rise to applaud the president and half the chamber stay in their seats  we see half the country tune in to watch  but know that much of the country has stopped even listening  imagine if next year was different  imagine if next year  the entire nation had a president they could believe in  a president who rallied all americans around a common purpose  that's the kind of president we need in this country  and with your help in the coming days and weeks  that's the kind of president i will be "], ["obama1", "i want to thank governor sebelius for her support in this campaign  for the leadership she's provided the state of kansas  and for the example she's set for democrats all across america  in her two terms as governor  kathleen sebelius has proved that new jobs and good schools  affordable health care and clean energy are not democratic ideas or republican ideas  they are american ideas  and she has shown america that the democratic party is a party that can run anywhere and win anywhere and lead anywhere as long as we're the party of change   the party of the future  governor sebelius is a bright part of that future  and we are grateful to have her with us here today  you know  we have been told for many years that we are becoming more divided as a nation  we have been made to believe that differences of race and region  wealth and gender  party and religion have separated us into warring factions  into red states and blue states made up of individuals with opposing wants and needs  with conflicting hopes and dreams  it is a vision of america that's been exploited and encouraged by pundits and politicians who need this division to score points and win elections  but it is a vision of america that i am running for president to fundamentally reject   not because of a blind optimism i hold  but because of a story i've lived  it's a story that began here  in el dorado  when a young man fell in love with a young woman who grew up down the road in augusta  they came of age in the midst of the depression  where he found odd jobs on small farms and oil rigs  always dodging the bank failures and foreclosures that were sweeping the nation  they married just after war broke out in europe  and he enlisted in patton's army after the bombing of pearl harbor  she gave birth to their daughter on the base at fort leavenworth  and worked on a bomber assembly line when he left for war  in a time of great uncertainty and anxiety  my grandparents held on to a simple dream   that they could raise my mother in a land of boundless opportunity  that their generation's struggle and sacrifice could give her the freedom to be what she wanted to be  to live how she wanted to live  i am standing here today because that dream was realized   because my grandfather got the chance to go to school on the gi bill  buy a house through the federal housing authority  and move his family west   all the way to hawaii   where my mother would go to college and one day fall in love with a young student from kenya  i am here because that dream made my parents' love possible  even then  because it meant that after my father left  when my mother struggled as a single parent  and even turned to food stamps for a time  she was still able to send my sister and me to the best schools in the country  and i'm here because years later  when i found my own love in a place far away called chicago  she told me of a similar dream  michelle grew up in a working class family on the south side during the  s  her father had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at just thirty years old  and yet  every day of his life  even when he had to rely on a walker to get him there  fraser robinson went to work at the local water filtration plant while his wife stayed home with the children  and on that single salary  he was able to send michelle and her brother to princeton  our family's story is one that spans miles and generations  races and realities  it's the story of farmers and soldiers  city workers and single moms  it takes place in small towns and good schools  in kansas and kenya  on the shores of hawaii and the streets of chicago  it's a varied and unlikely journey  but one that's held together by the same simple dream  and that is why it's american  that's why i can stand here and talk about how this country is more than a collection of red states and blue states   because my story could only happen in the united states  that's why i believe that we are not as divided as our politics suggests  that the dream we share is more powerful than the differences we have   because i am living proof of that ideal  and that is what i have seen all across this country over the course of this campaign  i've seen crumbling schools in south carolina that are stealing the future of black children and white children  i've been told of the injustice in the growing divide between main street and wall street by the lowest paid workers and the wealthiest billionaires  i've met autoworkers in iowa and teachers in new hampshire and dishwashers in nevada who are all fighting the same fight for better wages and good benefits and a retirement they can count on  and i've talked to young people and old people  democrats  independents  and republicans who love their country  support their troops  and believe it is time to bring them home from iraq  we are not as divided as our politics suggest  yes  we disagree  yes  we have interests and ideologies that don't always align  yes  we have real differences  but the biggest divide in america today is not between its people  it is between its people and their leaders in washington  dc  that is where our collective dream has been deferred  that's where the money and influence of lobbyists kill our plans to make health care more affordable or energy cleaner year after year after year  that's where campaign promises to keep jobs in america or put tax cuts in the pockets of working families are cast aside to make room for the politics of the moment  and that's where politicians would rather demonize each other to score points than come together to solve our common challenges  that is where the real division lies   in a politics that echoes through the media and seeps into our culture   the kind that seeks to drive us apart and put up walls where none exist  it's the politics that tells us that those who differ from us on a few things are different from us on all things  that our problems are the fault of those who don't think like us or look like us or come from where we do  the welfare queen is taking our tax money  the immigrant is taking our jobs  the gay person must be immoral  and the believer must be intolerant  well we are here to say that this is not the america we believe in and this is not the politics we have to accept anymore  not this time  not now  this will not be easy  because the change we seek will not just come from overcoming the ingrained and destructive habits of washington  it will require overcoming our own fears and our own doubts  it will require each of us to do our part in closing the moral deficit   the empathy deficit   that exists in this nation  it will take standing in one another's shoes and remembering that we are our brother's keeper  we are our sister's keeper  this will not be easy  but america's story tells me it's possible  my story tells me it's possible  what began here in kansas all those years ago tells me it's possible  because as we face another time of anxiety and uncertainty   a time where foreclosures sweep the nation and families struggle to stay afloat  where loved ones leave for war and parents wonder what kind of world their children will inherit   i believe that this nation can rally around the simple dream that my grandparents held on to even in the darkest of days  it's a dream that we can find a job with wages that support a family  that we can have health care that's affordable for when we get sick  that we can retire with dignity and security  and that we can provide our children with education and opportunity   so that they can be what they want to be and live how they want to live  they are the common dreams that can finally unite a nation around a common purpose  there are those who will continue to tell us we cannot do this  that we cannot come together  that the divisions in our politics run too deep  that we are offering the american people false hopes  but here's what i know  i know that when i hear people say that we can't come together to lift up working families who are struggling in this economy  i think back to the streets of chicago  where i began my career as a community organizer twenty five years ago  in the shadow of a closed steel mill  we brought white people and black people and latinos together to provide job training to the jobless and after school programs for children  block by block  we restored hope and opportunity to those neighborhoods  and i can believe we can do the same thing for the working families of america  right now  there's an economic stimulus package moving through congress that will provide a boost to the economy and to working families  it's similar to the one i proposed a few weeks ago  and would provide immediate tax relief for working families  i hope that when it's final  it will also provide relief to seniors and extend unemployment insurance to those who've lost their jobs  but we need to do even more to restore fairness and balance to our economy  last night  we heard the president say that he wanted to make his tax cuts for the wealthiest americans permanent   again  well we can't afford more george bush tax cuts for those who don't need them and weren't even asking for them  it's time to give tax relief to the middle class families who need it right now  when i am president  we'll stop giving tax breaks to companies who ship our jobs overseas  and i'll put a middle class tax cut into the pockets of working families  this tax cut will be worth up to   for a working family  we'll provide struggling homeowners some relief by giving them a tax credit that would cover ten percent of a family's mortgage interest payment every year  and we're also going to give seniors a break by eliminating income taxes for any retiree making less than   a year  because every single american should be able to retire with dignity and respect  that also means helping americans save for retirement when they're still working  when i'm president  employers will be required to enroll every worker in a direct deposit retirement account that places a small percentage of each paycheck into savings  you can keep this account even if you change jobs  and the federal government will match the savings for lower income  working families  it's also time we had a president who won't wait another ten years to raise the minimum wage  i will raise it to keep pace every year so that workers don't fall behind  i'll institute a credit card bill of rights that will ban credit card companies from changing the agreement you signed up for  changing the interest rate on debt you've already incurred  or charging interest on late fees  americans should pay what they owe  but they should also pay what's fair  not just what's profitable for some credit card company  the same principle should apply to our bankruptcy laws  i opposed the credit card industry's bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to climb out of debt  and when i'm president  i'll make sure that ceos can't dump your pension with one hand while they collect a bonus with the other  that's an outrage  and it's time we had a president who knows it's an outrage  it's also time we had a president who stopped talking about the outrage of   million uninsured americans and started doing something about it  when i hear that we can't come together and expand health care to the uninsured  i think back to how i was able to bring democrats and republicans together in illinois to provide health insurance to   children and parents  and when i'm president  we'll finally pass a universal health care plan that will make sure every single american can get the same kind of health care that members of congress get for themselves  my plan does more to cut costs than any other plan in this race   up to   for a typical family  and we won't pass it twenty years from now  not ten years from now   we'll pass health care by the end of my first term in office  when i hear that there's no way we can overcome the power of lobbyists and special interests  i think about how i was able to pass the first major ethics reform in illinois twenty five years  i think about how in washington  i was able to bring democrats and republicans together to pass the strongest lobbying reform in a generation   we banned gifts from lobbyists  meals with lobbyists  subsidized travel on fancy jets  and for the first time in history  we forced lobbyists to tell the american public who they're raising money from and who in congress they're funneling it to  washington lobbyists haven't funded my campaign  they won't run my white house  and they will not drown out the voices of working americans when i am president  and when i hear that some of our kids just can't learn  that we can't do anything about crumbling schools and rising tuition  i think back to the chances that somebody  somewhere gave my family  the ticket my father got to come study in america  the opportunity my mother had to put herself through graduate school  the chance i had to go to the best schools in the country  even though we didn't have much  it is time to give every child in america that kind of chance   no matter what they look like or where they come from  when i am president  we will provide all our children with a world class education  from the day they're born until the day they graduate college  that means early childhood education to give them the best possible start  that means not just talking about how great teachers are  but rewarding them for their greatness  with better pay  and more support  and it means providing every american with a   a year tax credit that will finally help make a college education affordable and available for all  this election is our chance   our moment   to restore the simple dream of those who came before us for another generation of americans  but only if we can come together and like previous generations did and close that divide between a people and its leaders in washington  because in the end  the choice in this election is not between regions or religions or genders  it's not about rich versus poor  young versus old  and it is not about black versus white  it's about the past versus the future  it's about whether we settle for the same divisions and distractions and drama that passes for politics today  or whether we reach for a politics of common sense and innovation  of shared sacrifice and shared prosperity  in the face of war and depression  through great struggle and tremendous sacrifice  that is the future that my grandparents' generation forged for their children  it is why that little girl who was born at fort leavenworth could dream as big as the kansas sky  and it is why i stand before you today   because there are two little girls i tuck in at night who deserve a world in which they can dream those same big dreams  in which they can have the same chances as any other child living any other place  it is a dream i share for your children and all of our children  and that is why it's american   always hoping  always reaching  always striving for that better day ahead  i hope you'll join me on that journey  and i thank you for welcoming me back to the place my family called home "], ["obama1", "thank you caroline   for your introduction  your support  and your lifetime of service to a grateful nation  you continue to inspire americans of all ages and walks of life  let me also say a few words about another american who has called us to a common purpose  john edwards has spent a lifetime fighting to give voice to the voiceless and hope to the struggling  at a time when our politics is too focused on who's up and who's down  he made us focus on who matters   the new orleans child without a home  the west virginia miner without a job  the families who live in that other america that is not seen or heard or talked about in washington  john and elizabeth edwards believe deeply that two americans can become one  their campaign may have ended  but this cause lives on for all of us who believe that we can achieve one america  seven months from now  the democratic party will gather here in denver to nominate our candidate for president of the united states  we will come together after a long and hard fought primary campaign   and that's a good thing  because it is through campaigns that we hear directly from the american people  set our common goals  and debate our differences  it is through campaigns that we bring new people into the process  build new coalitions  and renew who we are and what we stand for as a party  it is fitting that the journey leads to denver   a city that is younger than the democratic party itself  but filled with the promise that our party has always fought for  this city  built at the base of the rocky mountains  stands as a monument to a uniquely american belief in things unseen  here  in denver  fur trappers and traders  gold rushers and ranchers  came in search of opportunity  and made the future their own  the story of america leads west  it is a story of ideals that know no boundaries  it is a story of immigrants who set out from distant shores  pioneers who persevered  and people of all races  religions  and ethnic groups who put aside their doubts to seek a new frontier  my own family's journey moved west   from kansas  where my grandparents met and married  and my mother was born  to the pacific coast after world war ii  and then across an ocean to hawaii  their journey   like so many others   speaks to a simple truth written into the story of america  it's a truth at the foundation of the democratic party's purpose  denver's progress  and our nation's promise  in america  the future is what we decide it's going to be  as candidates  we must give new meaning to that promise  and seven months from now  one of us will stand before that convention hall  and give voice to the hopes  and dreams  and determination of americans all across our country  in six days  you get to choose who will be that voice  you get to choose who will be able to build a new majority of not just democrats   but independents and republicans   to win in november  and transform our country  and if you put your trust in me  i will stand up at that convention and say that our divisions are past  our hope is the future  and our time for change has come  now there is one thing we know for certain about the election in november  the name george bush will not be on the ballot  the name of my cousin   dick cheney   will not be on the ballot  but the choice before you is about what comes next  because we need to do more than turn the page on the failed bush cheney policies  we have to turn the page on the politics that helped make those policies possible  lobbyists setting an agenda in washington that feeds the inequality  insecurity  and instability in our economy  division and distraction that keeps us from coming together to deal with challenges like health care  and clean energy  and crumbling schools year after year after year  cronyism that gave us katrina instead of competent government  and secrecy that made torture permissible and illegal wiretaps possible  it's a politics that uses   to scare up votes  and fear and falsehoods to lead us into a war in iraq that should've never been authorized and should've never been waged  each candidate running for the democratic nomination shares an abiding desire to end the disastrous policies of the current administration  but we must decide   in the debate that leads to denver   just what kind of party we want to be  and what lessons we've learned from the bitter partisanship of the last two decades  we can be a party that tries to beat the other side by practicing the same do anything  say anything  divisive politics that has stood in the way of progress  or we can be a party that puts an end to it  i am running for president because i believe that we need fundamental change in america  not just a change of party in the white house  but change in washington that the american people can believe in   unity instead of division  hope instead of fear  a politics that leaves behind the fights of the past so that we can finally take hold of our future  we began this campaign one year ago on the steps of the old statehouse in springfield  at the time  we made a bet on the american people  that bet was simple   we weren't going to change anything by relying on the same washington games  instead  we were betting on the american people's hunger for change  and your ability to make change happen from the bottom up  and we are showing america what change looks like  from the snows of iowa to the sunshine of south carolina  we have built a movement of young and old  rich and poor  black and white  latino  asian and native american  we've reached americans of all political stripes who are more interested in turning the page than turning up the heat on our opponents  that's how democrats will win in november and build a majority in congress  not by nominating a candidate who will unite the other party against us  but by choosing one who can unite this country around a movement for change  if you choose change  you will have a nominee who doesn't take a dime from washington lobbyists and pacs  we don't need a candidate who agrees with republicans that lobbyists are part of the system in washington  they're part of the problem  and when i'm president  their days of setting the agenda in washington will be over  if you choose change  you will have a nominee who doesn't just tell people what they want to hear  poll tested positions and calculated answers might be how washington confronts challenges  but it's not how you overcome them  it's not how you inspire our nation to come together behind a common purpose  and it's not what america needs right now  if you choose change  you will have a nominee who isn't just playing on the same electoral map where half the country starts out against us  because you will have a nominee who has already brought in more independents and republicans  young people and new voters  than we have seen in a generation  i know it is tempting   after another presidency by a man named george bush   to simply turn back the clock  and to build a bridge back to the  th century  there are those will tell us that our party should nominate someone who is more practiced in the art of pursuing power  that's it's not yet our turn or our time  there was also a time when caroline kennedy's father was counseled by a former president to  be patient  and to step aside for  someone with greater experience  but john f  kennedy responded by saying   the world is changing  the old ways will not do it is time for a new generation of leadership it is time for a new generation of leadership  because the old politics just won't do  i am running for president   right now   because i have met americans all across this country who cannot afford to wait another day for change  that is why the real choice in this campaign is not between regions or religions or genders  it's not about rich versus poor  young versus old  and it is not about black versus white  it is about the past versus the future  and when i am the nominee  the republicans won't be able to make this election about the past because you will have already chosen the future  it's time for new leadership for an economy where families are being forced to foreclose on their dreams  and workers have seen their pensions disappear  in the short term  we need what i have consistently called for   a stimulus plan that gives the american people a tax rebate  and that also extends relief to seniors and expands unemployment insurance  and in the long term  we need to put the american dream on a firmer foundation  we're not going to offer the american people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who voted to put the banks and big business ahead of hard working americans  i've been fighting for working people my entire public life  and when i am president  i'll make sure that ceos can't dump your pension with one hand while they collect a bonus with the other  i'll pass bankruptcy laws that protect workers instead of banks  and i'll crack down on fraudulent mortgage lenders  and credit card companies that change your rates to push you further into debt  it's time for new leadership for the maytag worker who is now competing with his own teenage son for a   an hour job at walmart because the factory he gave his life to shut its doors  we're not going to offer the american people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who argues year after year for trade that isn't fair  but calls for a time out on trade when they run for president  i will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working americans  i will stop giving the wealthiest americans tax cuts that they don't need and didn't ask for  and restore fairness to our economy  i'll give a tax cut to working people  provide relief to homeowners  and eliminate the income tax for seniors making under   so they can retire with the dignity and security they have earned  it's time for new leadership for the woman i met who can't get medicaid to cover the needs of her sick child  she can't afford to wait another four years or another fifteen years to get health care because we've put forward a nominee who can't bring democrats and republicans together to get things done  i know that the reason americans don't have health care isn't because no one is forcing them to buy it   it's because they can't afford it  that's why my plan cuts costs by up to   for a typical family  and makes health care available and affordable for every single american  that's the plan that i'll pass in my first term as president  it is time for new leadership for children going to overcrowded schools in east l a  for the teacher i met who is working at dunkin donuts to make ends meet  for the young people who are ready to go to college but can't afford it  when i'm president  we'll rally this country to the cause of world class education  that means putting our kids on a pathway to success with universal  quality  affordable early childhood education  that means paying our teachers more  and making sure they're not just teaching to the test   but teaching art and music and literature  that means giving our young people an annual   tax credit for college tuition if they serve their community  and that means expanding americorps to   slots  and issuing a call to service for a new generation  but that also means calling on parents to do their part   to get off the couch  turn off the television  and read to our children  because responsibility for education starts at home  it's time for new leadership so that my daughters and your children don't grow up in a century where our economy is weighed down by our addiction to oil  our foreign policy is held hostage to the whims of dictators  and our planet passes a moment of no return  when i'm president  we won't wait any longer to reduce emissions  when i called for higher fuel efficiency standards  i didn't do it in front of an environmental group in california or in boulder   that would have been the easy thing to do  i did it in front of the automakers in detroit  now it was pretty quiet   i didn't get a lot of applause  but we need leadership that tells the american people not just what they want to hear  but what we need to know  that's what i'll do  we cannot wait to invest in the next generation of biofuels  and wind and solar  if president kennedy could send us to the moon in less than a decade   then we can meet this great challenge our generation  we can set the goal of an   reduction in global emissions by   and we can lead the world to confront the climate crisis  and it's time for new leadership for the woman who told me that she hasn't been able to breathe since the day her nephew left for iraq  and the soldier who doesn't know his own child because he's on his third or fourth tour of duty  i will end the mentality that says the only way for democrats to look tough on national security is by talking  acting and voting like george bush republicans  it's time to reject the counsel that says the american people would rather have someone who is strong and wrong than someone who is weak and right   it's time to say that we are the party that is going to be strong and right  it's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with john mccain is not by nominating someone who agreed with him on voting for the war in iraq  who agreed with him by voting to give george bush the benefit of the doubt on iran  who agrees with him in embracing the bush cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like  and who actually differed with him by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions when the politics of the moment changed  we need to offer the american people a clear contrast on national security  and when i am the nominee of the democratic party  that's exactly what i will do  talking tough and tallying up your years in washington is no substitute for judgment  and courage  and clear plans  it's not enough to say you'll be ready from day one   you have to be right from day one  i opposed this war in iraq from the start  and i have never  ever wavered in that opposition  i warned about taking our eye off of osama bin laden  and overstretching our troops and their families as we have seen in communities across this country like fort carson  and when i am president  i will immediately begin to remove our troops  i will finally put meaningful pressure on iraq's leaders to reconcile  and i will end this war  and i will do what we should have done back in   increase our commitment to afghanistan  press pakistan to take action against terror  and finish the fight with al qaeda  i will challenge the conventional thinking that says we can't conduct diplomacy with leaders we don't like  strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries as well as their friends  and that's what i'll do  and when i am president  we will keep nuclear weapons from terrorists by securing all loose nuclear materials around the world during my first term in office  we will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons  and we will pursue it  it's time for new leadership that reaches out  as president kennedy did to my own father  to people  in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery  it's time to restore our moral leadership by rejecting torture without equivocation  by closing guantanamo  by restoring habeas corpus  and by again being that light of justice to dissidents in prison camps around the globe  it's time for america to lead the world against the common threats of the  st century   terrorism and nuclear weapons  but also climate change and poverty  genocide and disease  i will send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says   you matter to us  your future is our future  and our moment is now  this is what the moment demands of us   to cast off our doubts  to reach once more for what america can be if we have the courage to make the future our own  we've been warned  in these last few weeks  that this kind of change isn't possible  that we're peddling false hopes  that we need a reality check  and we've faced forces that are not the fault of any one campaign   forces that open american wounds  the politics that uses religion as a wedge  and patriotism as a bludgeon  a politics that tells us what we have to think and even vote within the confines of the categories that supposedly define us  the assumption that young people are apathetic  the assumption that republicans won't cross over  the assumption that the wealthy care nothing for the poor  and that the poor don't vote  the assumption that african americans can't support the white candidate  whites can't support the african american candidate  and blacks and latinos can't come together  but our party   the democratic party   has always been at its best when we rose above these divisions  when we called all americans to a common purpose  a higher purpose  when we stood up and said that we will write our own future  and the future will be what we want it to be  we followed a king to the mountaintop  and a kennedy who called on us to reject the mindless menace of violence  we're the party of a young president who asked what we could do for our country  and who put us on a path to the moon  we're the party of a man who overcame his own disability  who told us that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself  and who faced down fascism and liberated a continent from tyranny  we're the party of jackson  who took back the white house for the people of this country  and we're the party of jefferson  who wrote the words that we are still trying to heed   that all of us are created equal   and who sent us west to blaze new trails  to make new discoveries  and to realize the promise of our highest ideals  that is who we are  that is the party that we need to be  and can be  if we cast off our doubts  and leave behind our fears  and choose the america that we know is possible  because there is a moment in the life of every generation  if it is to make its mark on history  when its spirit has to come through  when it must choose the future over the past  when it must make its own change from the bottom up  this is our moment  this is our message   the same message we had when we were up  and when we were down  the same message that we will carry all the way to the convention  and in seven months time   right here in denver   we can realize this promise  we can claim this legacy  we can choose new leadership for america  because there is nothing we cannot do if the american people decide it is time "], ["obama1", "thank you   cheers  applause  thank you  thank you   chants of  obama  obama  thank you  thank you so much  thank you

federal government will respond quickly and rapidly to make sure that they get all the help that they need   applause  the polls are just closing in california   cheers  applause  and the votes are still being counted in cities and towns across america  but there is one thing   audience member  we love you  barack  mr  obama  you know i love you back   laughter  cheers  applause  but there is one thing on this february night that we do not need the final results to know  our time has come   cheers  applause  our time has come  our movement is real   cheers  applause  and change is coming to america   cheers  applause  only a few hundred miles from here  almost one year ago to the day  as dick said  we stood on the steps of the old state capitol to reaffirm a truth that was spoken there so many generations ago  that a house divided cannot stand    cheers    that we are more than a collection of red states and blue states  we are and always will be the united states of america   cheers  applause   chants of  usa  usa  usa  what began as a whisper in springfield soon carried across the cornfields of iowa  where farmers and factory workers  students and seniors stood up in numbers we have never seen before  they stood up to say that maybe this year we don't have to settle for politics where scoring points is more important than solving problems   cheers  applause  maybe this year we can finally start doing something about health care we can't afford   cheers  maybe this year we can start doing something about mortgages we can't pay  maybe this year  this time can be different   cheers  applause  their voices echoed from the hills of new hampshire to the deserts of nevada  where teachers and cooks and kitchen workers stood up to say that maybe washington doesn't have to be run by lobbyists anymore   cheers  applause  maybe the voices of the american people can finally be heard again   cheers  applause  they reached the coast of south carolina  when people said that maybe we don't have to be divided by race and region and gender    cheers  applause    that the crumbling schools are stealing the future of black children and white children    cheers  applause    that we can come together and build an america that gives every child everywhere the opportunity to live out their dreams  this time can be different   cheers  applause  and today  on this tuesday in february  in states north and south  east and west  what began as a whisper in springfield has swelled to a chorus of millions calling for change   cheers  applause  it's a chorus that cannot be ignored  a chorus that cannot be deterred  this time can be different because this campaign for the presidency of the united states of america is different   cheers  applause   chants of  yes  we can  yes  we can  it's different not because of me  it's different because of you    cheers  applause    because you are tired of being disappointed and you're tired of being let down   cheers  applause  you're tired of hearing promises made and plans proposed in the heat of a campaign  only to have nothing change when everyone goes back to washington   cheers  applause  nothing changes because lobbyists just write another check or politicians start worrying about how to win the next election instead of why they should    cheers  applause    or because they focus on who's up and who's down instead of who matters  and while washington is consumed with the same drama and divisions and distractions  another family puts up a  for sale  sign in their front yard  another factory shuts its doors  another soldier waves goodbye as he leaves on another tour of duty in a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged    cheers  applause    that goes on and on and on   cheers  applause  but in this election  at this moment  you are standing up all across this country to say   not this time     cheers     not this year   crowd says in unison   not this year  the stakes are too high and the challenges too great to play the same washington game with the same washington players and somehow expect a different result  this time must be different  this time we have to turn the page  this time we have to write a new chapter in american history   cheers  applause  this time we have to seize the moment   cheers  applause  now  this isn't about me and it's not about senator clinton  as i've said before  she was a friend before this campaign  she'll be a friend after it's over   cheers  i respect her  i respect her as a colleague  i congratulate her on her victories tonight  she's been running an outstanding race  but this fall  this fall we owe the american people a real choice   cheers  applause  we have to choose between change and more of the same  we have to choose between looking backwards and looking forward   cheers  applause  we have to choose between our future and our past  it's a choice between going into this election with republicans and independents already united against us or going against their nominee with a campaign that has united americans of all parties  from all backgrounds  from all races  from all religions  around a common purpose   cheers  applause  it's a choice between having a debate with the other party about who has the most experience in washington or having one about who's most likely to change washington    cheers  applause    because that's a debate that we can win   cheers  applause  it's a choice between a candidate who's taken more money from washington lobbyists than either republican in this race and a campaign that has not taken a dime of their money because we have been funded by you  you have funded this campaign   cheers  applause   chants of  yes  we can  yes  we can  and if i am your nominee  my opponent will not be able to say that i voted for the war in iraq  because i didn't    cheers    or that i gave george bush the benefit of the doubt on iran  because i haven't    cheers  applause    or that i support the bush cheney doctrine of not talking to leaders we don't like  because i profoundly disagree with that approach   cheers  applause  and he will not be able to say that i wavered on something as fundamental as whether or not it's okay for america to use torture  because it's never okay  that is the choice in this election   cheers  applause  the republicans running for president have already tied themselves to the past  they speak of a  year war in iraq  they talk about billions more in tax breaks for the wealthiest few  who don't need them and didn't even ask for them  tax breaks that mortgage our children's future on a mountain of debt at a time when there are families who can't pay their medical bills and students who can't pay their tuition   cheers  applause  those republicans are running on the politics of yesterday  and that is why our party must be the party of tomorrow   cheers  applause  and that is the party that i intend to lead as president of the united states of america   cheers  applause  i'll be the president who ends the tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas    cheers    and start putting them in the pockets of hard working americans who deserve them  and struggling homeowners who deserve them and seniors who should retire with dignity and respect  and deserve them   cheers  applause  i'll be the president who finally brings democrats and republicans together to make health care affordable and available for every single american   cheers  applause  we will put a college education within the reach of anyone who wants to go   cheers  applause  and instead of just talking about how great our teachers are  we will reward them for their greatness with more pay and better support   cheers  applause  and we will harness the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all   cheers  applause  and we will invest in solar and wind and biodiesel  clean energy  green energy that can fuel economic development for generations to come  that's what we're going to do when i'm president of the united states   cheers  applause  when i'm president  we will put an end to the politics of fear    cheers  applause    a politics that uses   as a way to scare up votes  we're going to start seeing   as a challenge that should unite america and the world against the common threats of the  st century  terrorism and nuclear weapons  climate change and poverty  genocide and disease   cheers  applause  we can do this   cheers  applause  we can do this   crowd says in unison   yes  we can  but it will not be easy  it will require struggle and it will require sacrifice  there will be setbacks  and we will make mistakes  and that is why we need all the help we can get   cheers  applause  so tonight i want to speak directly to all those americans who have yet to join this movement but still hunger for change  they know it in their gut  they know we can do better than we're doing  they know that we can take our politics to a higher level  but they're afraid  they've been taught to be cynical  they're doubtful that it can be done  but i'm here to say tonight to all of you who still harbor those doubts  we need you   cheers  applause  we need you to stand with us   cheers  applause  we need you to work with us   cheers  applause  we need you to help us prove that together  ordinary people can still do extraordinary things in the united states of america   cheers  applause  i am blessed to be standing in the city where my own extraordinary journey of service began   cheers  applause  you know  just a few miles from here  down on the south side  in the shadow of a shuttered steel plant  it was there that i learned what it takes to make change happen  i was a young organizer then   in fact  there are some folks here who i organized with   a young organizer intent on fighting joblessness and poverty on the south side  and i still remember one of the very first meetings i put together  we had worked on it for days  we had made phone calls  we had knocked on doors  we had put out fliers  but on that night  nobody showed up   laughter  our volunteers who had worked so hard felt so defeated  they wanted to quit  and to be honest  so did i  but at that moment  i happened to look outside and i saw some young boys tossing stones at a boarded up apartment building across the street  they were like the boys in so many cities across the country  little boys  but without prospects  without guidance  without hope for the future  and i turned to the volunteers and i asked them   before you quit  before you give up  i want you to answer one question  what will happen to those boys if we don't stand up for them   cheers  applause  and those volunteers  they looked out that window and they saw those boys and they decided that night to keep going  to keep organizing  keep fighting for better schools  fighting for better jobs  fighting for better health care  and i did too  and slowly but surely  in the weeks and months to come  the community began to change  you see  the challenges we face will not be solved with one meeting in one night  it will not be resolved on even a super duper tuesday  change will not come if we wait for some other person or if we wait for some other time  we are the ones we've been waiting for   cheers  applause  we are the change that we seek  we are the hope of those boys who have so little  who've been told that they cannot have what they dream  that they cannot be what they imagine  yes  they can   cheers  applause  we are the hope of the father who goes to work before dawn and lies awake with doubt that tells him he cannot give his children the same opportunities that someone gave him  yes  he can   crowd says in unison   yes  he can  we are the hope of the woman who hears that her city will not be rebuilt  that she cannot somehow claim the life that was swept away in a terrible storm  yes  she can   crowd says in unison   yes  she can  we are the hope of the future  the answer to the cynics who tell us our house must stand divided  that we cannot come together  that we cannot remake this world as it should be  we know that we have seen something happen over the last several weeks  over the past several months  we know that what began as a whisper has now swelled to a chorus that cannot be ignored    cheers  applause    that will not be deterred  that will ring out across this land as a hymn that will heal this nation    cheers  applause    repair this world  make this time different than all the rest  yes  we can  let's go to work  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can   chants of  yes  we can  yes  we can  thank you  chicago  let's go get to work  i love you   cheers  applause "], ["obama1", "it's good to be back in new orleans  i'm just sorry that i'm a few days late for mardi gras  new orleans is a city that has always shown america what is possible when we have the imagination to see the unseen  and the determination to work for it  it's a city where slaves met in congo square to raise their voices in improbable joy  and a young man named louis from  back of town  played his first tunes  it's a city where jackson turned back the british  and a great port connected america's heartland to the gulf  it's a city where races and religions and languages all mixed together to form something new  something different  and something special   an imperfect place made more perfect through its promise of forgiveness  now  in the wake of this quintessentially american city's greatest test  we see the stirrings of a new day  this great university is well into another academic year  the st  charles streetcar is rattling downtown  the endymion  en dim' ee uhn  parade again winds through the streets of mid city  a son of new orleans   eli manning   even won an improbable super bowl victory  most importantly  with each passing day  with each student who goes to school  with each business that opens its doors  with each worker who puts in a shift  new orleanians are reclaiming their future  and showing america just what can be done in this country when citizens lift up their communities  but there is another side to this story  because we know that this city   a city that has always stood for what can be done in this country   has also become a symbol for what we could not do  to many americans  the words  new orleans  call up images of broken levees  water rushing through the streets  mothers holding babies up to avoid the flood  and worse   the memory of a moment when america's government failed its citizens  because when the people of new orleans and the gulf coast extended their hand for help  help wasn't there  when people looked up from the rooftops  for too long they saw empty sky  when the winds blew and the floodwaters came  we learned that for all of our wealth and power  something wasn't right with america  we can talk about what happened for a few days in   and we should  we can talk about levees that couldn't hold  about a fema that seemed not just incompetent  but paralyzed and powerless  about a president who only saw the people from the window of an airplane  we can talk about a trust that was broken   the promise that our government will be prepared  will protect us  and will respond in a catastrophe  but we also know the broken promises did not start when a storm hit  and they did not end there  when president bush came down to jackson square two weeks after the storm  the setting was spectacular and his promises soaring   we will do what it takes  he said   we will stay as long as it takes  to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives  but over two years later  those words have been caught in a tangle of half measures  half hearted leadership  and red tape  yes  parts of new orleans are coming back to life  but we also know that over   families are still living in small trailers  that thousands of homes sit empty and condemned  and that schools and hospitals and firehouses are shuttered  we know that even though the street cars run  there are fewer passengers  that even though the parades sound their joyful noise  there is too much violence in the shadows  to confront these challenges we have to understand that katrina may have battered these shores   but it also exposed silent storms that have ravaged parts of this city and our country for far too long  the storms of poverty and joblessness  inequality and injustice  when i was down in houston visiting evacuees a few days after katrina  i met a woman in the reliant center who had long known these storms in her life  she told me   we had nothing before the hurricane  now we got less than nothing  we had nothing before the hurricane  now we got less than nothing  i think about her sometimes  i think about how america left her behind  and i wonder where she is today  america failed that woman long before that failure showed up on our television screens  we failed her again during katrina  and   tragically   we are failing her for a third time  that needs to change  it's time for us to restore our trust with her  it's time for america to rebuild trust with the people of new orleans and the gulf coast  when i am president  i will start by restoring that most basic trust   that your government will do what it takes to keep you safe  the words  never again    spoken so often in those weeks after katrina   must not fade to a whisper  the army corps of engineers has rebuilt levees that were most damaged by the storm  but funding has sometimes stalled  and new orleans remains unprotected  we can't gamble every hurricane season  when i am president  we will finish building a system of levees that can withstand a  year storm by   with the goal of expanding that protection to defend against a category   storm  we also have to restore nature's barriers   the wetlands  marshes and barrier islands that can take the first blows and protect the people of the gulf coast  if catastrophe comes  the american people must be able to call on a competent government  when i am president  the days of dysfunction and cronyism in washington will be over  the director of fema will report to me  he or she will have the highest qualifications in emergency management  and i won't just tell you that i'll insulate that office from politics   i'll guarantee it  by giving my fema director a fixed term like the director of the federal reserve  i don't want fema to be thinking for one minute about the politics of a crisis  i want fema to do its job  which is protecting the american people   not protecting a president's politics  and as soon as we take office  my fema director will work with emergency management officials in all fifty states to create a national response plan  because we need to know   before disaster comes   who will be in charge  and how the federal  state and local governments will work together to respond  but putting up defenses is not sufficient  because renewing trust with the people of new orleans is not just about stronger levees and pumping systems   it's about people  so many of us live a life that is ordered  with comforts we can count on  somewhere  we know  there are people who don't have a house with a sturdy roof  who have nowhere to go when they can't make rent  who don't have a car to drive to another city when a storm is coming  who can't get care when they're sick  or get the education that would give them a chance at their dreams  but too often  we lose our sense of common destiny  that understanding that we are all tied together  that when a woman has less than nothing in this country  that makes us all poorer  that is why the second thing we need to do is to make sure that reconstruction is making a real difference in peoples' lives  across this city  we see the evidence that george bush's promises were empty  it's not acceptable that federal money is not reaching communities that need it  or that louisiana officials have filled out millions of forms to get reconstruction funds  when i am president  the federal rebuilding coordinator will report directly to me  and we will ensure that resources show results  it's time to cut the red tape  so that the federal government is a partner   not an opponent   in getting things done  instead of giving no bid contracts to companies headed by the president's former campaign manager  we will make sure that rebuilding benefits the local economy  i have worked across the aisle in the senate to crack down on no bid contracts  and to make sure that emergency contracting is only done immediately after an emergency  when i am president  if there is a job that can be done by a new orleans resident  the contract will go to a resident of new orleans  and we'll provide tax incentives to businesses that choose to set up shop in the hardest hit areas  instead of letting families languish in trailers  we will ensure that every displaced resident can return to a home  today  tens of thousands of homeowners could end up without assistance because of funding shortfalls  that is unacceptable  we must work with louisiana to make the road home program more efficient  we should set a goal to approve every application for road home assistance within two months  and we need to increase rental property  so that we can bring down the cost of renting a home  instead of shuttered hospitals and provider shortages  we will help the gulf region rebuild a health care system that serves all its residents  we'll provide incentives like loan forgiveness to bring more doctors and nurses to new orleans  and we'll build new hospitals   including a new medical center downtown  and a state of the art veteran's hospital  and instead of unsafe streets and shocking crimes  we will help new orleans rebuild its criminal justice system  we'll start a new cops for katrina program to put more resources into community policing  so that heroic officers   men and women like nicola cotton  who gave her life serving the city she loved   have more support  and we'll launch a regional effort that brings together federal  state and local resources to combat crime and drug gangs across the gulf coast  the children of new orleans are america's children  we cannot stand by while they see a future filled with violence  or poverty  or hopelessness  our true measure of success must be ensuring that the children of new orleans and the gulf coast can dream the same dreams as every child in america  that is why the third part of our effort to rebuild trust must be providing a world class education  over two years after katrina  too many schools are still closed  kids are still going to class in makeshift buildings and trailers  class sizes run as large as forty children for each teacher  this is not acceptable  it's time for fema to speed up payment of the   million that congress recently allocated for school repairs  and it's time to invest in education  so that new orleans has the first class school system that it has needed for so long  that starts with the person standing in front of the classroom  many heroic  high quality teachers have returned to new orleans   but we need more  that is why i have called for   million to bring quality teachers back to the gulf region  any teacher or principal who commits to come here for three years should receive an annual bonus  and those who teach in subject areas where we face shortages   such as math and science   should receive an additional bonus  in new orleans   and across this country   we need to stop talking about how great our teachers are  we need to reward them for their greatness with more pay and more support  we need to recruit new teachers by helping them pay for a college education  we need to expand mentor programs to pair experienced teachers with new recruits  and we need to help them move up the career ladder and gain new skills  we can't accept an education policy where we pass a law called no child left behind and leave the money behind  and we can't just have our teachers teaching to a test   we need to encourage science and innovation  music and the arts  if there is any city in the world that shows us the value of culture and creativity  it is new orleans  and our commitment to education can't stop with a high school diploma  i have fought in the senate for post katrina support for xavier  southern and dillard  and i put forward a loan forgiveness program  to make it easier for students to come back to tulane and colleges and universities across the gulf region  it's time to make a college education affordable   not just in new orleans   but for all americans  that's why i'll give students who need a hand an annual   tax credit if you're willing to do your part by serving your community  and we need to tap the tremendous resource of community colleges  when i am president  we'll reward schools that graduate more students  and we'll help our schools determine what skills are needed to help local industry  so that graduates are well prepared to lift up the economy  and to rebuild their communities  because the trust we seek is not a one way street  it's going to take folks working together and doing their part  the government cannot rebuild the gulf coast for the people of the gulf coast  the government can only rebuild the gulf coast with the people of this region  all of this will cost money  the federal government has already promised the resources  but they need to be spent more efficiently and more wisely  when i am president  we will target funds to programs that make a difference  and make sure that resources meet the needs of the people   and that means working closely with state and local officials  and asking that they keep up their end of the bargain  i promise you that when i'm in the white house i will commit myself every day to keeping up washington's end of this trust  this will be a priority of my presidency  and i will make it clear to members of my administration that their responsibilities don't end in places like the  th ward   they begin there  but i will also ask the people of this city to do your part  because together  we can do more than rebuild a city  we can create a model for america   for how we prepare for disasters  for how we fight poverty  for how we put our kids on a pathway to success  if we do this  then we can once again make new orleans the city that stands for what we can do in america  not a symbol for what we can't do  if we do this  then we can begin to turn the page on the invisible barriers   the silent storms   that have ravaged this city and this country  the old divisions of black and white  of rich and poor  it's time to leave that to yesterday  it's time to choose tomorrow  here at tulane  your degree will open up many doors  i hope that many of you will choose to stay here in new orleans  and to make this work your own  because you are the change that this city seeks  you can be this city's tomorrow  you can help close those divisions  and by doing so  you can help to heal this nation  what better place to begin this work than new orleans  here  in the city that gave us jazz  we know that even the most painful note can be followed by joy  here  in this city  if we look hard enough  we can imagine the unseen   homes filled with families  businesses putting folks to work  schools extending opportunity  the next verse in the american song  that is what is possible if we can trust each other  and if we have the imagination to see the unseen  and the determination to work for it "], ["obama1", "it has now been one year since we began this campaign for the presidency on the steps of the old state capitol in springfield  illinois   just me and   of my closest friends  at the time  there weren't too many who imagined we'd be standing where we are today  i knew i wouldn't be washington's favorite candidate  i knew we wouldn't get all the big donors or endorsements right off the bat  i knew i'd be the underdog in every contest from january to june  i knew it wouldn't be easy  but then something started happening  as we met people in their living rooms and on their farms  in churches and town hall meetings  they all started telling a similar story about the state of our politics today  whether they're young or old  black or white  latino or asian  democrat  independent or even republican  the message is the same  we are tired of being disappointed by our politics  we are tired of being let down  we're tired of hearing promises made and ten point plans proposed in the heat of a campaign only to have nothing change when everyone goes back to washington  because the lobbyists just write another check  or because politicians start worrying about how they'll win the next election instead of why they should  or because they focus on who's up and who's down instead of who matters  and while washington is consumed with the same drama and division and distraction  another family puts up a for sale sign in the front yard  another factory shuts its doors forever  another mother declares bankruptcy because she cannot pay her child's medical bills  and another soldier waves goodbye as he leaves on another tour of duty in a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged  it goes on and on and on  year after year after year  but in this election   at this moment   americans are standing up all across the country to say  not this time  not this year  the stakes are too high and the challenges too great to play the same washington game with the same washington players and expect a different result  and today  voters from the west coast to the gulf coast to the heart of america stood up to say that it is time to turn the page  we won louisiana  and nebraska  and the state of washington  and i believe that we can win in virginia on tuesday if you're ready to stand for change  each of us running for the democratic nomination agrees on one thing that the other party does not   the next president must end the disastrous policies of george w  bush  and both senator clinton and i have put forth detailed plans and good ideas that would do just that  but i am running for president because i believe that to actually make change happen   to make this time different than all the rest   we need a leader who can finally move beyond the divisive politics of washington and bring democrats  independents  and republicans together to get things done  that's how we'll win this election  and that's how we'll change this country when i am president of the united states  this week we found out that the presumptive nominee of the republican party is senator john mccain  now  john mccain is a good man  an american hero  and we honor his half century of service to this nation  but in this campaign  he has made the decision to embrace the failed policies george bush's washington  he speaks of a hundred year war in iraq and sees another on the horizon with iran  he once opposed george bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest few who don't need them and didn't ask for them  he said they were too expensive and unwise  and he was absolutely right  but somewhere along the line  the wheels came off the straight talk express because he now he supports the very same tax cuts he voted against  this is what happens when you spend too long in washington  politicians don't say what they mean and they don't mean what they say  and that is why in this election  our party cannot stand for business as usual in washington  the democratic party must stand for change  this fall  we owe the american people a real choice  it's a choice between debating john mccain about who has the most experience in washington  or debating him about who's most likely to change washington  because that's a debate we can win  it's a choice between debating john mccain about lobbying reform with a nominee who's taken more money from lobbyists than he has  or doing it with a campaign that hasn't taken a dime of their money because we've been funded by you   the american people  and it's a choice between taking on john mccain with republicans and independents already united against us  or running against him with a campaign that's united americans of all parties around a common purpose  there is a reason why the last six polls in a row have shown that i'm the strongest candidate against john mccain  it's because we've done better with independents in almost every single contest we've had  it's because we've won in more red states and swing states that the next democratic nominee needs to win in november  virginia democrats know how important this is  that's how mark warner won in this state  that's how tim kaine won in this state  that's how jim webb won in this state  and if i am your nominee  this is one democrat who plans to campaign in virginia and win in virginia this fall  we are here to make clear that this election is not between regions or religions or genders  it's not about rich versus poor  young versus old  and it is not about black versus white  it is about the past versus the future  the republicans in washington are already running on the politics of yesterday  which is why our party must be the party of tomorrow  and that is the party i will lead as president of the united states  i know what it takes to pass health care reform because i've done it   not by demonizing anyone who disagrees with me  but by bringing democrats and republicans together to provide health insurance to   children and parents in illinois  and when i am president  we'll pass universal health care not in twenty years  not in ten years  but by the end of my first term in office  but you don't have to take my word for it  senator ted kennedy recently said that he wouldn't have endorsed me if he didn't believe passionately that i will fight for universal health care as president  and if there's someone who knows something about health care  it's ted kennedy  my plan would bring down premiums for the typical family by   a year  we'd ban insurance companies from denying you coverage because of a pre existing condition  we'd allow every american to get the same kind of health care that members of congress get for themselves  and the one difference between my plan and senator clinton's plan is that she said she'd  go after  your wages if you don't buy health care  well i believe the reason people don't have health care isn't because no one's forced them to buy it  it's because no one's made it affordable   and that's why we bring down the cost of health care more than any other plan in this race  it's also time to bring the cost of living down for working families who are struggling in this economy like never before  they're facing rising costs and falling wages  and we owe it to them to end the bush mccain tax cuts for the wealthiest   and put a tax cut into the pockets of the families who need it  that's what i did in illinois when i brought democrats and republicans together to provide   million in tax relief to working families and the working poor  and that's the kind of tax relief i'll provide as president  i will end the tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas and give a middle class tax break to   of working americans  and homeowners who are struggling  and seniors who deserve to retire with dignity and respect  and i won't wait another ten years to raise the minimum wage in this country   i will raise it to keep pace with inflation every single year  it's also time to give every child  everywhere  a world class education  from the day they're born to the day they graduate college  i am only here today because somebody  somewhere  gave my father a ticket to come study in america  because my mother got the opportunity to put herself through graduate school  because even though we didn't have much growing up  i got scholarships to go to some of the best schools in the country  that's the chance i believe every child should have  when i am president  we will give our children the best possible start by investing in early childhood education  we'll stop talking about how great our teachers are  and start rewarding them for their greatness  with better pay and more support  and we will provide every american with a   a year tax credit that will finally help make a college education affordable and available for all  and when i am president  this party will be the party that finally makes sure our sons and daughters don't grow up in a century where our economy is weighed down by our addiction to oil  our foreign policy is held hostage to the whims of dictators  and our planet passes a moment of no return  when i called for higher fuel efficiency standards  i didn't do it in front of an environmental group in california   i did it in front of the automakers in detroit  now it was pretty quiet   i didn't get a lot of applause  but we need leadership that tells the american people not just what they want to hear  but what we need to know  that's why i will set the goal of an   reduction in carbon emissions by   and we will meet it   with higher fuel standards and new investments in renewable fuels that will create millions of new jobs and entire new industries right here in america  finally  it is time to turn the page on eight years of a foreign policy that has made us less safe and less respected in the world  if i am the nominee of this party  john mccain will not be able to say that i agreed with him on voting for the war in iraq  agreed with him on giving george bush the benefit of the doubt on iran  and agree with him in embracing the bush cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like  because that doesn't make us look strong  it makes us look arrogant  john f  kennedy said that you should never negotiate out of fear  but you should never fear to negotiate  and that's what i will do as president  i don't just want to end this war in iraq  i want to end the mindset that got us into war  it is time to turn the page  this is our moment  this is our time for change  our party   the democratic party   has always been at its best when we've led not by polls  but by principle  not by calculation  but by conviction  when we've called all americans to a common purpose   a higher purpose  we are the party of jefferson  who wrote the words that we are still trying to heed   that all of us are created equal   that all of us deserve the chance to pursue our happiness  we're the party of jackson  who took back the white house for the people of this country  we're the party of a man who overcame his own disability to tell us that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself  who faced down fascism and liberated a continent from tyranny  and we're the party of a young president who asked what we could do for our country  and the challenged us to do it  that is who we are  that is the party that we need to be  and can be  if we cast off our doubts  and leave behind our fears  and choose the america that we know is possible  because there is a moment in the life of every generation  if it is to make its mark on history  when its spirit has to come through  when it must choose the future over the past  when it must make its own change from the bottom up  this is our moment  this is our message   the same message we had when we were up  and when we were down  the same message that we will carry all the way to the convention  and in seven months time we can realize this promise  we can claim this legacy  we can choose new leadership for america  because there is nothing we cannot do if the american people decide it is time "], ["obama1", "it was nearly a century ago that the first tractor rolled off the assembly line at this plant  the achievement didn't just create a product to sell or profits for general motors  it led to a shared prosperity enjoyed by all of janesville  homes and businesses began to sprout up along milwaukee and main streets  jobs were plentiful  with wages that could raise a family and benefits you could count on  prosperity hasn't always come easily  the plant shut down for a period during the height of the depression  and major shifts in production have been required to meet the changing times  tractors became automobiles  automobiles became artillery shells  suvs are becoming hybrids as we speak  and the cost of transition has always been greatest for the workers and their families  but through hard times and good  great challenge and great change  the promise of janesville has been the promise of america   that our prosperity can and must be the tide that lifts every boat  that we rise or fall as one nation  that our economy is strongest when our middle class grows and opportunity is spread as widely as possible  and when it's not   when opportunity is uneven or unequal   it is our responsibility to restore balance  and fairness  and keep that promise alive for the next generation  that is the responsibility we face right now  and that is the responsibility i intend to meet as president of the united states  we are not standing on the brink of recession due to forces beyond our control  the fallout from the housing crisis that's cost jobs and wiped out savings was not an inevitable part of the business cycle  it was a failure of leadership and imagination in washington   the culmination of decades of decisions that were made or put off without regard to the realities of a global economy and the growing inequality it's produced  it's a washington where george bush hands out billions in tax cuts year after year to the biggest corporations and the wealthiest few who don't need them and don't ask for them   tax breaks that are mortgaging our children's future on a mountain of debt  tax breaks that could've gone into the pockets of the working families who needed them most  it's a washington where decades of trade deals like nafta and china have been signed with plenty of protections for corporations and their profits  but none for our environment or our workers who've seen factories shut their doors and millions of jobs disappear  workers whose right to organize and unionize has been under assault for the last eight years  it's a washington where politicians like john mccain and hillary clinton voted for a war in iraq that should've never been authorized and never been waged   a war that is costing us thousands of precious lives and billions of dollars a week that could've been used to rebuild crumbling schools and bridges  roads and buildings  that could've been invested in job training and child care  in making health care affordable or putting college within reach  and it's a washington that has thrown open its doors to lobbyists and special interests who've riddled our tax code with loopholes that let corporations avoid paying their taxes while you're paying more  they've been allowed to write an energy policy that's keeping us addicted to oil when there are families choosing between gas and groceries  they've used money and influence to kill health care reform at a time when half of all bankruptcies are caused by medical bills  and then they've rigged our bankruptcy laws to make it harder to climb out of debt  they don't represent ordinary americans  they don't fund my campaign  and they won't drown out the voices of working families when i am president  this is what's been happening in washington at a time when we have greater income disparity in this country than we've seen since the first year of the great depression  at a time when some ceos are making more in a day than the average workers makes in a year  when the typical family income has dropped by   over the last seven years  when wages are flat  jobs are moving overseas  and we've never paid more for health care  or energy  or college  it's a time when we've never saved less   barely   for the average family last year   and never owed more   an average of   per family  and it's a time when one in eight americans now lives in abject poverty right here in the richest nation on earth  at a time like this  it's no wonder that the mortgage crisis was the straw that broke the camel's back  the equity that people own in their homes is often their largest source of savings  and as millions upon millions have seen those savings and their home equity decline or disappear altogether  so have their dreams for a better future  i realize that politicians come before you every election saying that they'll change all this  they lay out big plans and hold events with workers just like this one  because it's popular to do and it's easy to make promises in the heat of a campaign  but how many times have you been disappointed when everyone goes back to washington and nothing changes  because the lobbyists just write another check  or because politicians start worrying about how they'll win the next election instead of why they should  because they're focused on who's up and who's down instead of who matters   the worker who just lost his pension  the family that just put up the for sale sign  the young woman who gets three hours of sleep a night because she works the late shift after a full day of college and still can't afford her sister's medicine  these are the americans who need real change   the kind of change that's about more than switching the party in the white house  they need a change in our politics   a leader who can end the division in washington so we can stop talking about our challenges and start solving them  who doesn't defend lobbyists as part of the system  but sees them as part of the problem  who will carry your voices and your hopes into the white house every single day for the next four years  and that is the kind of president i want to be  i didn't spend my career in the halls of washington  i began it in the shadow of a closed steel mill on the south side of chicago  we organized churches and community leaders  african americans  whites  and hispanics to lift neighborhoods out of poverty  provide job training to the jobless  and set up after school programs so that kids had a safe place to go while their parents worked  those are the voices i carried with me to the illinois state senate  where i brought democrats and republicans together to expand health insurance to   children and parents  where i led the fight to provide   million in tax relief for working families and the working poor  they're the voices i carried with me to washington  where the first bill i introduced was to make college more affordable  where i fought against a bankruptcy bill that made it harder for families to climb out of debt  and where i passed the most sweeping lobbying reform in a generation   reform that forced lobbyists to tell the american people who they're raising money from and who in congress they're funneling it to  so when i talk about real change that will make a real difference in the lives of working families   change that will restore balance in our economy and put us on a path to prosperity   it's not just the poll tested rhetoric of a political campaign  it's the cause of my life  and you can be sure that it will be the cause of my presidency from the very first day i take office  now we know that we cannot put up walls around our economy  we know that we cannot reverse the tide of technology that's allowed businesses to send jobs wherever there's an internet connection  we know that government cannot solve all our problems  and we don't expect it to  but that doesn't mean we have to accept an america of lost opportunity and diminished dreams  not when we still have the most productive  highly educated  best skilled workers in the world  not when we still stand on the cutting edge of innovation  and science  and discovery  not when we have the resources and the will of a decent  generous people who are ready to share in the burdens and benefits of a global economy  i am certain that we can keep america's promise   for this generation and the next  so today  i'm laying out a comprehensive agenda to reclaim our dream and restore our prosperity  it's an agenda that focuses on three broad economic challenges that the next president must address   the current housing crisis  the cost crisis facing the middle class and those struggling to join it  and the need to create millions of good jobs right here in america  jobs that can't be outsourced and won't disappear  the first challenge is to stem the fallout from the housing crisis and put in place rules of the road to prevent it from happening again  a few weeks ago i offered an economic stimulus package based on a simple principle   we should get immediate relief into the hands of people who need it the most and will spend it the quickest  i proposed sending each working family a   tax cut and each senior a   supplement to their social security check  and if the economy gets worse  we should double those amounts  neither george bush nor hillary clinton had that kind of immediate  broad based relief in their original stimulus proposals  but i'm glad that the stimulus package that was recently passed by congress does  we still need to go further  though  and make unemployment insurance available for a longer period of time and for more americans who find themselves out of work  we should also provide assistance to state and local governments so that they don't slash critical services like health care or education  for those americans who are facing the brunt of the housing crisis  i've proposed a fund that would provide direct relief to victims of mortgage fraud  we'd also help those who are facing closure refinance their mortgages so they can stay in their homes  and i'd provide struggling homeowners relief by offering a tax credit to low  and middle income americans that would cover ten percent of their mortgage interest payment every year  to make sure that folks aren't tricked into purchasing loans they can't afford  i've proposed tough new penalties for those who commit mortgage fraud  and a home score system that would allow consumers to compare various mortgage products so that they can find out whether or not they'll be able to afford the payments ahead of time  the second major economic challenge we have to address is the cost crisis facing the middle class and the working poor  as the housing crisis spills over into other parts of the economy  we've seen people's entire life savings wiped out in an instant  it's the result of skyrocketing costs  stagnant wages  and disappearing benefits that are pushing more and more americans towards a debt spiral from which they can't escape  we have to give them a way out by cutting costs  putting more money in their pockets  and rebuilding a safety net that's become badly frayed over the last decades  one of the principles that john edwards has passionately advanced is that this country should be rewarding work  not wealth  that starts with our tax code  which has been rigged by lobbyists with page after page of loopholes that benefit big corporations and the wealthiest few  for example  we should not be giving tax breaks to corporations that make their profits in some other country with some other workers  before she started running for president  senator clinton actually voted for this loophole  i'll change our tax code so that it's simple  fair  and advances opportunity  not the agenda of some lobbyist  i am the only candidate in this race who's proposed a genuine middle class tax cut that will provide relief to   of working americans  this is a tax cut  paid for in part by closing corporate loopholes and shutting down tax havens   that will offset the payroll tax that working americans are already paying  and it'll be worth up to   for a working family  we'll also eliminate income taxes for any retiree making less than   per year  because our seniors are struggling enough with rising costs  and should be able to retire in dignity and respect  since the earned income tax credit lifts nearly   million americans out of poverty each year  i'll double the number of workers who receive it and triple the benefit for minimum wage workers  and i won't wait another ten years to raise the minimum wage   i'll guarantee that it keeps pace with inflation every single year so that it's not just a minimum wage  but a living wage  because that's the change that working americans need  my universal health care plan brings down the cost of health care more than any other candidate in this race  and will save the typical family up to   a year on their premiums  every american would be able to get the same kind of health care that members of congress get for themselves  and we'd ban insurance companies from denying you coverage because of a pre existing condition  and the main difference between my plan and senator clinton's plan is that she'd require the government to force you to buy health insurance and she said she'd  go after  your wages if you don't  well i believe the reason people don't have health care isn't because no one's forced them to buy it  it's because no one's made it affordable   and that's what we'll do when i am president  if we want to train our workforce for a knowledge economy  it's also time that we brought down the cost of a college education and put it within reach of every american  i know how expense this is  at the beginning of our marriage  michelle and i were spending more to payoff our college loans than we were on our mortgage  so i'll create a new and fully refundable tax credit worth   for tuition and fees every year  a benefit that students will get in exchange for community or national service  which will cover two thirds of the tuition at the average public college or university  and i'll also simplify the financial aid application process so that we don't have a million students who aren't applying for aid because it's too difficult  with so many mothers and fathers juggling work and parenting  the next cost we have to bring down is the cost of living in a two income family  i'll expand the child care tax credit for people earning less than   a year  and i'll double spending on quality afterschool programs  we'll also expand the family medical leave act to include more businesses and millions more workers  and we'll change a system that's stacked against working women by requiring every employer to provide seven paid sick days a year  so that you can be home with your child if they're sick  in addition to cutting costs for working families  we also need to help them save more   especially for retirement  that's why we'll require employers to enroll every worker in a direct deposit retirement account that places a small percentage of each paycheck into savings  you can keep this account even if you change jobs  and the federal government will match the savings for lower income  working families  finally  we need to help families who find themselves in a debt spiral climb out  since so many who are struggling to keep up with their mortgages are now shifting their debt to credit cards  we have to make sure that credit cards don't become the next stage in the housing crisis  to make sure that americans know what they're signing up for  i'll institute a five star rating system to inform consumers about the level of risk involved in every credit card  and we'll establish a credit card bill of rights that will ban unilateral changes to a credit card agreement  ban rate changes to debt that's already incurred  and ban interest on late fees  americans need to pay what they owe  but they should pay what's fair  not what fattens profits for some credit card company  the same principle should apply to our bankruptcy laws  when i first arrived in the senate  i opposed the credit card industry's bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to climb out of debt  five years earlier  senator clinton had supported a nearly identical bill  and during a debate a few weeks back  she said that even though she voted for it  she was glad it didn't pass  now  i know those kind of antics might make sense in washington  but they don't make much sense anywhere else  and they certainly don't make sense for working families who are struggling under the weight of their debt  when i'm president  we'll reform our bankruptcy laws so that we give americans who find themselves in debt a second chance  i'll close the loophole that allows investors with multiple homes to renegotiate their mortgage in bankruptcy court  but not victims of predatory lending  we'll make sure that if you can demonstrate that you went bankrupt because of medical expenses  then you can relieve that debt and get back on your feet  and i'll make sure that ceos can't dump your pension with one hand while they collect a bonus with the other  that's an outrage  and it's time we had a president who knows it's an outrage  those are the steps we can take to ease the cost crisis facing working families  but we still need to make sure that families are working  we need to maintain our competitive edge in a global by ensuring that plants like this one stay open for another hundred years  and shuttered factories re open as new industries that promise new jobs  and we need to put more americans to work doing jobs that need to be done right here in america  for years  we have stood by while our national infrastructure has crumbled and decayed  in   the american society of civil engineers gave it a d  citing problems with our airports  dams  schools  highways  and waterways  one out of three urban bridges were classified as structurally deficient  and we all saw the tragic results of what that could mean in minnesota last year  right here in wisconsin  we know that   million of freight will come through this state by   and if we do not have the infrastructure to handle it  we will not get the business  for our economy  our safety  and our workers  we have to rebuild america  i'm proposing a national infrastructure reinvestment bank that will invest   billion over ten years  this investment will multiply into almost half a trillion dollars of additional infrastructure spending and generate nearly two million new jobs   many of them in the construction industry that's been hard hit by this housing crisis  the repairs will be determined not by politics  but by what will maximize our safety and homeland security  what will keep our environment clean and our economy strong  and we'll fund this bank by ending this war in iraq  it's time to stop spending billions of dollars a week trying to put iraq back together and start spending the money on putting america back together instead  it's also time to look to the future and figure out how to make trade work for american workers  i won't stand here and tell you that we can   or should   stop free trade  we can't stop every job from going overseas  but i also won't stand here and accept an america where we do nothing to help american workers who have lost jobs and opportunities because of these trade agreements  and that's a position of mine that doesn't change based on who i'm talking to or the election i'm running in  you know  in the years after her husband signed nafta  senator clinton would go around talking about how great it was and how many benefits it would bring  now that she's running for president  she says we need a time out on trade  no one knows when this time out will end  maybe after the election  i don't know about a time out  but i do know this   when i am president  i will not sign another trade agreement unless it has protections for our environment and protections for american workers  and i'll pass the patriot employer act that i've been fighting for ever since i ran for the senate   we will end the tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas  and we will give those breaks to companies who create good jobs with decent wages right here in america  i believe that we can create millions of those jobs around a clean  renewable energy future  a few hours northeast of here is the city of manitowoc  for over a century  it was the home of mirro manufacturing   a company that provided thousands of jobs and plenty of business  in   mirro closed its doors for good after losing thousands of jobs to mexico  but in the last few years  something extraordinary has happened  thanks to the leadership of governor doyle and mayor kevin crawford  manitowoc has re trained its workers and attracted new businesses and new jobs  orion energy systems works with companies to reduce their electricity use and carbon emissions  and tower tech is now making wind turbines that are being sold all over the world  hundreds of people have found new work  and unemployment has been cut in half  this can be america's future  i know that general motors received some bad news yesterday  and i know how hard your governor has fought to keep jobs in this plant  but i also know how much progress you've made   how many hybrids and fuel efficient vehicles you're churning out  and i believe that if our government is there to support you  and give you the assistance you need to re tool and make this transition  that this plant will be here for another hundred years  the question is not whether a clean energy economy is in our future  it's where it will thrive  i want it to thrive right here in the united states of america  right here in wisconsin  and that's the future i'll fight for as your president  my energy plan will invest   billion over ten years to establish a green energy sector that will create up to   million new jobs over the next two decades   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  we'll also provide funding to help manufacturers convert to green technology and help workers learn the skills they need for these jobs  we know that all of this must be done in a responsible way  without adding to the already obscene debt that has grown by four trillion dollars under george bush  we know that we cannot build our future on a credit card issued by the bank of china  and that is why i've paid for every element of this economic agenda   by ending a war that's costing us billions  closing tax loopholes for corporations  putting a price on carbon pollution  and ending george bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest   of americans  in the end  this economic agenda won't just require new money  it will require a new spirit of cooperation and innovation on behalf of the american people  we will have to learn more  and study more  and work harder  we'll be called upon to take part in shared sacrifice and shared prosperity  and we'll have to remind ourselves that we rise and fall as one nation  that a country in which only a few prosper is antithetical to our ideals and our democracy  and that those of us who have benefited greatly from the blessings of this country have a solemn obligation to open the doors of opportunity  not just for our children  but to all of america's children  that is the spirit that's thrived in janesville from the moment that first tractor came off the assembly line so many years ago  it's the spirit that led my grandmother to her own assembly line during world war ii  and my grandfather to march in patton's army  when that war ended  they were given the chance to go to college on the gi bill  to buy a house from the federal housing authority  and to give my mother the chance to go to the best schools and dream as big as the kansas sky  even though she was a single mom who didn't have much  it's the same chance she gave me  and why i'm standing here today  it's a promise that's been passed down through the ages  one that each generation of americans is called to keep   that we can raise our children in a land of boundless opportunity  broad prosperity  and unyielding possibility  that is the promise we must keep in our time  and i look forward to working and fighting to make it real as president of the united states  thank you "], ["obama1", "houston  i think we've achieved liftoff here   applause  let me just  first of all  say thank you to some special people who helped put this together  first of all  the pre program entertainment infinite groove  thank you so much  i want to thank the wonderful young lady who said the pledge of allegiance  melissa atkins  ph  that's not easy to do when you're   years old in front of   people  so thank you  melissa  there are many great elected officials state and local here  but i've got to give a special shout out to three of my fellow members of congress who are just great supporters  congressman al green   applause    congresswoman eddie bernice johnson  and congressman chet edwards  thank you so much   applause  i want to thank all the wonderful faith leaders who are here who gave me a little circle of prayer before coming out here today  i want to thank some wonderful union supporters  seiu in the house   applause  the united food and commercial workers and the transport workers  thank you so much for your wonderful support  now  there's a little bit of business that we've got to do before we get into the main event  early voting has started here in texas   applause  early voting has started here in texas  and so everybody has received one of these cards  and everybody knows that you can start voting today  and if you didn't vote today  you can start tomorrow  or the next day  or the day after that  but we have early voting in texas  i don't want you to wait until march  th  i want you to go ahead and start voting tomorrow here in texas   applause  you've got february  th until  th to vote  and you can also vote on election day  march  th  now  i know this was explained to you  this is a little confusing  you're going to have to do two things for me now  not only do you have to vote   and we would prefer you to vote early   but on election day  march  th  you're going to have to attend the caucus at   p m  to get us a few more delegates   applause  can everybody do that  houston  everybody going to do that   applause  audience  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can  mr  obama  yes  we can  and on the back   on the back here are all the sites for all the early voting locations  so you don't have an excuse for not going  and we want you to grab your cousin  and your uncle  and your niece  and your nephew  don't go alone  take some friends and family to the polls  now  we just heard that we won tonight in wisconsin   applause  and i am grateful to the people of wisconsin for their friendship  and their support  and their extraordinary civic pride  you know  in wisconsin when you go to vote it's five degrees outside  but that has not deterred people from milwaukee to green bay to eau claire  all across that state  from casting their ballot and exercising their civic duty   applause  we also have a caucus in hawaii tonight  it's too early to know how that will turn out  it's too early to know  but we do know this  we do know this  houston  the change we seek is still months and miles away  and we need the good people of texas to help us get there   applause  we will need you to fight for every delegate it takes to win this nomination  and if we win the nomination  if we are blessed and honored to win the nomination  then we're going to need your help to win the election in november   applause  and if we win that election in november  then we are going to need your help and your time  your energy  your enthusiasm  your mobilization  your organization  and your voices to help us change america over the next four years   applause  because understand this  houston  as wonderful as this gathering is  as exciting as these enormous crowds and this enormous energy may be  what we're trying to do here is not easy  and it will not happen overnight  it is going to take more than big rallies  it's going to require more than rousing speeches  it will also require more than policy papers and positions and web sites  it is going to require something more  because the problem that we face in america today is not the lack of good ideas  it's that washington has become a place where good ideas go to die   applause    because lobbyists crush them with their money and their influence  because politicians spend too much time trying to score political points and not enough time trying to bridge their differences so we can get something done   applause  the problem is that we haven't had leaders who can inspire the american people to rally behind a common purpose and a higher purpose  and this is what we need to change today  this is what's hard  and we know this  we know how difficult it will be  but i also know why we're here tonight  we're here because we still believe that change is possible   applause  we're here because we know that we've never needed it more than we do right now   applause  we're here because there are workers in youngstown  ohio  who've watched job after job after job disappear because of bad trade deals like nafta  who've worked in factories   who've worked in factories for   years  and then one day they come in and literally see the equipment unbolted from the floor and sent to china  they need us to end those tax breaks that go to companies that ship jobs overseas   applause    and give them to companies that invest in jobs right here in the united states of america  that pay well  provide a pension  provide health care  that's the change they need   applause  we're here because of the mother in san antonio that i met just today  just this afternoon  she's got  year old twins who are legally blind  she somehow entered into a predatory loan and saw her mortgage payments double in two weeks and has paid thousands in fees to try to stave off foreclosure  she told me she was on the verge of packing and didn't know where her family would go next  she needed us to crack down on predatory lenders and give relief to struggling homeowners who were tricked out of their dream  she needs change today   applause  we're here because of the mother that i met in green bay  wisconsin  who gave me this bracelet that i'm wearing  inscribed on it is the name of her son  ryan  he was   when he was killed by a roadside bomb in iraq  and next to his name  it says   all gave some  but he gave all   applause  we are here because it is time to ask ourselves as a nation if we are serving ryan and his compatriots and all our young  brave men and women as well as they are serving us  they need us to end this war  and bring them home  and give them the care and the benefits that they deserve  they need change  houston   applause  a year ago  a year ago i stood on the steps of the old state capitol in springfield  illinois  and i announced this improbable journey to change america  and there were those who said at the time   why are you running so soon  why are you running this time  you're a relatively young man  you can afford to wait  and i had to explain to them i'm not running because of some long held ambition  i know that some people have been looking through my kindergarten papers  but that's not why i decided to run   applause  i'm not running because i think it's somehow owed to me  i'm running because of what dr  king called the fierce urgency of now  the fierce urgency of now   applause  because there's such a thing  houston  as being too late  and that hour is almost upon us  we are at a defining moment in our history  our nation is at war  our planet is in peril  the dream that so many generations fought for feels like it's slowly slipping away  you see it in your own lives and in your own neighborhoods  the stories i told you are not unique  everywhere i go  i hear the same stories  people are working harder for less  they've never paid more for college  never paid more for gas at the pump   applause  our health care system leaves   million people without health insurance  and those who have it are seeing their co payments and deductibles and premiums going up year after year after year after year  despite the slogans  our children  millions of them  are being left behind  unable to compete in an international economy  in such circumstances  houston  we cannot afford to wait  we cannot wait to fix our schools  we cannot wait to fix our health care system  we cannot wait to put an end to global warming  we cannot wait to bring good jobs with good benefits back to the united states  we cannot wait to end this war in iraq  we cannot wait   applause  we cannot wait  and one year ago  one year ago when i made the decision to run  it was based on the belief that the size of our challenges had outstripped the capacity of a broken and divided politics to solve  and i was certain that the american people were hungry for something new  that they were tired of a politics that tears each other down  they wanted a politics that would lift the country up  that they had grown weary of a politics that was based on spin and p r  they wanted a politics that was based on honesty and truthfulness and straight talk to the american people  i was convinced  most of all  that change in america does not happen from the top down  it happens from the bottom up   applause  some of you know i used to work as a community organizer with churches on the south side of chicago after the steel plants had laid thousands of people off  and we brought together black and white and hispanic to try to create job training programs for the unemployed and bring economic development to neighborhoods that had fallen on hard times  and it was the best education i ever had  because it taught me that ordinary people can do extraordinary things when they're given an opportunity   applause  it reminded me that americans are decent and generous  willing to work hard and sacrifice on behalf of future generations  and if we could just get beyond the divisions that have become so commonplace in our politics  if we could bridge the divides so that black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  young  old  rich and poor  republican  democrat  if we could join together to challenge the special interests in washington  but also to challenge ourselves  also to challenge ourselves to be better  to be better neighbors  to be better citizens  to be better parents  then i believe there was no challenge we could not solve  no destiny we could not fulfill  that was the bet that i made one year ago  and i'm here to report  houston  that after a year of traveling all across the country  after countless miles and thousands of speeches  and talks  and shaking hands  and chicken dinners   laughter    i am here to report that my bet has paid off and my faith in the american people has been vindicated  because all across the country  people are standing up and saying   it is time to turn the page  it is time to write a new chapter in american history  we want to move forward into a better tomorrow  the american people  audience  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can  mr  obama  yes  we can  the american people have spoken out  and they are saying we need to move in a new direction  and i would not be running  as aware as i am of my imperfections  as clear as i am that i am not a perfect vessel  i would not be running if i did not believe that i could lead this country in that new direction  that we have a unique moment that we have to seize  but i have to tell you  houston  i can't do it by myself  no president can  remember  change doesn't happen from the top  it happens because of you  and so the question i have for you tonight  houston  is  are you really ready for change   applause  are you really ready for change  because if you are ready for change  then we can go ahead and tell the lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda are over   applause  they have not funded my campaign  they will not run my white house  and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i'm president of the united states of america   applause  if you are ready for change  houston  then we can stop talking about the outrage of   million people without health insurance and start doing something about it  i put forward a plan that says everybody will be able to get health insurance that is at least as good as the plan i've got as a member of congress  and if you already have health insurance  we will lower your premiums by   per family  per year  and if you can't afford it  we will subsidize your care  and we will emphasize prevention so we have a health care system instead of a disease care system  and we won't do this   years from now or   years from now  we will do it by the end of my first term as president of the united states of america  if you are ready for change  if you're really ready  then we can start restoring some balance to our economy  i believe in the free market  i know texans believe in entrepreneurship  we are an independent and a self reliant people  we don't believe in government doing what we can do for ourselves  but when we've got ceos making more in   minutes than ordinary workers are making in a year   applause  mr  obama    and it's the ceos who are getting a tax break and workers are left with nothing  then something is wrong  and something has to change  so i want to   i want to take away those tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas  we're going to give them to companies that invest right here in america  and we're going to rollback those bush tax cuts that went to all the wealthy people  and we're going to give tax cuts to ordinary families  people who are making less than   we will offset your payroll tax  senior citizens who make less than   we want to say to them  you don't have to pay an income tax  you're already having a hard time making ends meet  we want to promote trade and we embrace globalization  but we also want our trade deals to have labor standards and environmental standards and safety standards so our workers aren't undermined and our children aren't playing with toys based in lead paint  that's the change we want  and i will raise the minimum wage not every   years  but to keep pace with inflation  because if you work in america you should not be poor  and that's a goal that we should set for ourselves when i am president of the united states of america   applause  if you're ready for change  we can assure that every child in america has the best education this country has to offer   applause    from the day that child is born to the day that child graduates from college  the problem is not the lack of plans  the lack of good ideas  the problem is a lack of political will  a lack of urgency  we think that those children in inner city houston  those are those children  those are somebody else's problem  we think that the child in south texas  that's somebody else's problem  that's not our problem  that's not our child  we think that that child in rural east texas  where there's a low property tax base and they can't afford to buy new textbooks or put into computers  that's somebody else's problem  houston  i am here to tell you that every child is our problem  every child is our responsibility   applause    every child needs to be nurtured and embraced  and so we are going to invest in early childhood education to close the achievement gap  and i won't just talk about how great teachers are  i will reward them for their greatness   applause    by giving them higher salaries and giving them more support  and i want the highest standards in our schools  we have to have high standards  standards of excellence in order to compete in this global economy  but i don't want our standards measured just by a single high stakes standardized test  because i don't want our teachers teaching to the tests   applause  i want our students learning art  and music  and science  and literature  and social studies   applause  and i don't know about you  but i think it's about time we made college affordable for every young person in america   applause  so we're going to provide a   tuition credit  every student  every year  but  students  you're going to have to give back something in return  you're going to have to participate in community service  you're going to have to work in a homeless shelter  or a veteran's home  or an underserved school  or join the peace corps  we'll invest in you  you invest in america  together  we will march this country forward   applause  if you are ready for change  we can start having an energy policy that makes sense  we send a billion dollars to foreign nations every single day  and we're melting the polar icecaps in the bargain  that has to change  and so we're going to cap the emission of greenhouse gases  we are going to generate billions of dollars from polluters to invest in solar  in wind  and biodiesel   applause  we are going to raise fuel efficiency standards on cars because that is the only way that we can actually bring down gas prices over the long term  and i know you need that  and  by the way  when i talked about increasing fuel efficiency standards  i didn't do it in front of some environmental group  i did it in detroit in front of the automakers  and i told them they had to change their ways  and when i said that  i've got to admit that the room was really quiet  nobody clapped  but that's ok  because part of what you need from the next president is somebody who will not just tell you what they think you want to hear  but will tell you what you need to hear  will tell you the truth  if you're ready for change  we can stop using immigration as a political football and actually start solving the problem  we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants  and those two things we can join together  we can get serious about our borders and crack down on employers who are taking advantage of undocumented workers and undermining u s  labor   applause  but we can also provide a pathway for those who are living here  they can pay a fine and learn english and go to the back of the line  but we've got to give them an opportunity  too  we're a nation of immigrants   applause  if you're ready for change  we can start reinvesting in america  in the cities  we are spending   billion a month in iraq    billion  we can invest that money in rebuilding roads and bridges and hospitals right here in houston  building schools  laying broadband lines  putting people back to work  employing young men and young women in our inner cities  in our rural communities  that is possible if you're ready for change  we can create the kind of foreign policy that will make us safe and will lead to renewed respect of america around the world   applause  you know  as your commander in chief  my job will be to keep you safe   applause  my job will be to keep you safe  and i will not hesitate to strike against any who would do us harm  i will do whatever is required  but part of keeping you safe is maintaining the finest military in the world  and that means providing our troops with the proper equipment and the proper training and the proper rotations  and it means caring for our troops when they come home  not forgetting about our troops  no more homeless veterans  no more begging for disability payments  no more waiting in line for the v a  we have a solemn obligation to honor those who have served on our behalf  but part of keeping you safe is also deploying our military wisely  and the war in iraq was unwise   applause  it distracted us from the fight that needed to be fought in afghanistan against al qaida  they're the ones who killed   americans  it fanned the flames of anti american sentiment  it has cost us dearly in blood and in treasure  i opposed this war in   i will bring this war to an end in   it is time to bring our troops home   applause  but i don't want to just end the war  i want to end the mindset that got us into war   applause  i want to end a politics based on fear that uses   as a way to scare up votes instead of a way to bring the country together against a common enemy  i want to rediscover the power of our diplomacy  i said early in this campaign i would meet not just with our friends  but also with our enemies  and there were those in washington who said   you can't do that  and i said   yes  i can   applause    because i remember what john f  kennedy said  he said we should never negotiate out of fear  but we should never fear to negotiate  strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries  and tell them where america stands  and try to resolve differences without resort to war  and when we do that  i believe the world is waiting  i want to go before the world community and say   america's back  and we are ready to lead   applause  but we will lead not just with militarily  yes  we will hunt down terrorists  yes  we will lock down loose nuclear weapons that could do us harm  but we are also going to lead on climate change  we're also going to lead on helping poor countries deal with the devastation of hiv aids  we're also going to lead in bringing an end to the genocide in darfur   applause  we are going to lead by example  by maintaining the highest standards of civil liberties and human rights  which is why i will close guantanamo and restore habeas corpus and say no to torture   applause  because if you are ready for change  then you can elect a president who has taught the constitution  and believes in the constitution  and will obey the constitution of the united states of america   applause  all these things are possible  if you are ready for change  but i have to say that there are a lot of people these days who are telling you not to believe  they're trying to persuade you that   well  obama may have good ideas  but he hasn't been in washington long enough  we need to season and stew him a little bit more and boil all the hope out of him  but i think you understand and the american people understand that the last thing we need is to have the same old folks doing the same old things  making the same mistakes over and over and over again   applause  we need something different  and we need new leadership to move into a new century  there are those who would say that you have to be wary about inspiration because you might be disappointed  who say that obama may make a good speech  but what is really going to make a difference is how you work our government  but i have to say that it is my central premise that the only way we will bring about real change in america is if we can bring new people into the process  if we can attract young people  if we can attract independents  if we can stop fighting with republicans and try to bring some over to our side  i want to form a working majority for change  that's how we win elections  that's how we will govern  i want to reach out to everybody  i know that there are some who say   well  what about john mccain  and i revere and honor john mccain's service to this country   applause  he is a genuine american hero  but when he embraces george bush's failed economic policies  when he says that he is willing to send our troops into another   years of war in iraq  then he represents the policies of yesterday  and we want to be the party of tomorrow  and i'm looking forward to having that debate with john mccain  but  you know  there's something deeper in this argument we've been hearing about inspiration  it really has to do with the meaning of hope  some of you know i talk about hope a lot  and it's not surprising  because  if you think about it  the odds of me standing here are very slim   applause  you know  i was born to a teenage mother  my father left when i was   so i was raised by a single mom and my grandparents  and they didn't have money  and they didn't have fame  what they could give me was love  they gave me an education  and they gave me hope   applause  and so i talk about hope  i put  hope  on my signs  i gave a speech in boston at the convention about hope  i wrote a book called  the audacity of hope  but now some are suggesting that i must be naive  that if you talk about hope it means that you're fuzzy headed  you're not realistic  you're peddling in false hopes  you need a reality check  the implication is  is that if you talk about hope that you must be passive and you're just waiting for good things to happen  and you don't realize how mean and tough the world can be  but understand that's not what hope is  hope is not blind optimism  hope is not ignoring or being ignorant of the challenges that stand between you and your dreams  i know how difficult it will be to provide health insurance to every american  if it was easy  it would have already been done  i know how hard it will be to change our energy policy  because the status quo serves many powerful people  i know how hard it will be to alleviate poverty that has built up over centuries  how hard it will be to fix schools  because changing our schools will require not just money  but a change in attitudes  we're going to have to parent better  and turn off the television set  and put the video games away  and instill a sense of excellence in our children  and that's going to take some time  i know how easy it is for politicians to turn us on each other  to use immigrants or gay people or folks who aren't like us as scapegoats for what they do  but i also know this  i know this because i have fought on the streets as an organizer  i have fought in the courts as a civil rights attorney  i have fought in the legislature  and i've won some battles  but i've also lost some  because good intentions aren't always enough  they have to be fortified by political will and political power  but i also know this  houston  that nothing worthwhile in this country has ever happened except somebody somewhere was willing to hope   applause  that is how this country was founded  a group of patriots declaring independence against the mighty british empire  nobody gave them a chance  but they had hope  that's how slaves and abolitionists resisted an evil system and how a new president chartered a course to ensure that we would not remain half slave and half free  that is how the greatest generation  my grandfather fighting in patton's army  my grandmother staying at home with a baby  working on a bomber assembly line  how that greatest generation defeated hitler and fascism and lifted itself up out of a great depression  that's how pioneers settled the west  that's how immigrants traveled at great risk from distant shores  that is how women won the right to vote  that's how workers won the right to organize  that's how young people in the ' s traveled south  and some marched  and some sat in  and some were beaten  and some went to jail  and some died for freedom's cause  that's what hope is   applause  that's what hope is  that's what hope is  imagining  and then fighting for  and then working for  struggling for what did not seem possible before  you know  there is a moment in the life of every generation when that spirit has to come through  if we are to make our mark on history  when we decide to cast aside the fear and the doubt  when we're not willing to settle for what the cynics tell us we have to accept  but instead we are willing to reach for what we know in our gut is possible  when we decide that the next generation deserves the same chance that somebody gave us  when we determine that we're going to keep the dream alive for those who still hunger for opportunity and still thirst for justice  it will not be easy  but at some point in our lives  we all have to decide  as hard as it's going to be  we are going to join together  lock arms  and go about the difficult but noble task of remaking this nation  block by block  county by county  state by state  houston  this is our moment  this is our time   applause  and if you are willing to vote for me  if you are willing to stand with me  if you're willing to caucus for me  then i truly believe that we will not just win texas  we will win this nomination  we will win the general election  and you and i together will change this country and change the world  thank you  houston  i love you "], ["obama1", "our economy has been struggling for some time now  and as i've traveled across ohio  i've seen the face of this economy   a mother who told me she can't afford health care for her sick child  a father who's worried he won't be able to send his children to college  and seniors who've seen their pensions disappear because the companies they gave their lives to went bankrupt  i don't have to tell you about this  folks around here have been directly impacted by the changes in our economy   whether it was the loss of steel jobs over the past few decades  or the closing of the ford plant that was here for so long  and folks in this area are still worried about whether they're going to lose their jobs and how they're going to make ends meet if that happens  now  if we're honest with ourselves  we'll acknowledge that we can't stop globalization in its tracks and that some of these jobs aren't coming back  but what i refuse to accept is that we have to stand idly by while workers watch their jobs get shipped overseas  we need a president who's working as hard for you as you're working for your families  and that's the kind of president i intend to be  i've proposed a job creation agenda that starts with making sure trade works for american workers  we can't keep passing unfair trade deals like nafta that put special interests over workers' interests  now  senator clinton has been going to great lengths on the campaign trail to distance herself from nafta  yesterday  she said nafta was  negotiated  by the first president bush  not by her husband  but let's be clear  it was her husband who got nafta passed  in her own book  senator clinton called nafta one of  bill's successes  and  legislative victories  and yesterday  senator clinton also said i'm wrong to point out that she once supported nafta  but the fact is  she was saying great things about nafta until she started running for president  a couple years after it passed  she said nafta was a  free and fair trade agreement  and that it was  proving its worth  and in   she said   i think  on balance  nafta has been good for new york and america  one million jobs have been lost because of nafta  including nearly   jobs here in ohio  and yet  ten years after nafta passed  senator clinton said it was good for america  well  i don't think nafta has been good for america   and i never have  i didn't just start criticizing unfair trade deals like nafta because i started running for office   i'm doing it because i've seen what happens to a community when the factory closes down and the jobs move overseas  i began my career as a community organizer on the south side of chicago  fighting joblessness and poverty in neighborhoods that were devastated when the local steel plant closed  and it's because of this longstanding commitment to working families that i will not sign any trade agreement as president that does not have protections for our environment and protections for american workers  and i'll pass the patriot employer act that i've been fighting for ever since i ran for the senate so we can end tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas  and give those breaks to companies that create good jobs with decent wages here in america  it's also time to let our unions do what they do best   organize our workers  if a majority of workers want a union  they should get a union  it's that simple  we need to stand up to the business lobby  and pass the employee free choice act  that's why i've been fighting for it in the senate  and that's why i'll make it the law of the land when i'm president of the united states  we can also invest in american jobs by investing in america  and rebuilding our roads and bridges  i've proposed a national infrastructure reinvestment bank that will invest   billion over ten years  this will multiply into almost half a trillion dollars of additional infrastructure spending and generate nearly two million new jobs   many of them in the construction industry that's been hard hit by the housing crisis we're facing  in addition  we've also got to do more to create the green jobs that are jobs of the future  my energy plan will put   billion over ten years into establishing a green energy sector that will create up to   million new jobs over the next two decades   including jobs right here in ohio that pay well and can't be outsourced  we'll also provide funding to help manufacturers convert to green technology and help workers learn the skills they need for these jobs  we know that all of this must be done in a responsible way  without adding to the already obscene debt that has grown by four trillion dollars under george bush  we cannot build our future on a credit card issued by the bank of china  and that is why i'll pay for every part of this job creation agenda   by ending this war in iraq that's costing us billions  closing tax loopholes for corporations  putting a price on carbon pollution  and ending george bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  but in the end  enacting this agenda won't just require an investment  it will require a new spirit of cooperation  innovation  and shared sacrifice  we'll have to remind ourselves that we rise and fall as one nation  that a country in which only a few prosper is antithetical to our ideals and our democracy  and that those of us who have benefited greatly from the blessings of this country have a solemn obligation to open the doors of opportunity  not just for our children  but to all of america's children  that's the kind of vision i have for this country  and that's the kind of vision i hope to make real as president of the united states "], ["obama1", "well  we are in the middle of a very close race right now in texas  and we may not even know the final results until morning  we do know that senator clinton has won rhode island  and while there are a lot of votes to be counted in ohio  it looks like she did well there too  and so we congratulate her on those states  we also know that we have won the state of vermont  and we know this   no matter what happens tonight  we have nearly the same delegate lead as we did this morning  and we are on our way to winning this nomination  you know  decades ago  as a community organizer  i learned that the real work of democracy begins far from the closed doors and marbled halls of washington  it begins on street corners and front porches  in living rooms and meeting halls with ordinary americans who see the world as it is and realize that we have it within our power to remake the world as it should be  it is with that hope that we began this unlikely journey   the hope that if we could go block by block  city by city  state by state and build a movement that spanned race and region  party and gender  if we could give young people a reason to vote and the young at heart a reason to believe again  if we could inspire a nation to come together again  then we could turn the page on the politics that's shut us out  let us down  and told us to settle  we could write a new chapter in the american story  we were told this wasn't possible  we were told the climb was too steep  we were told our country was too cynical   that we were just being na ve  that we couldn't really change the world as it is  but then a few people in iowa stood up to say   yes we can  and then a few more of you stood up from the hills of new hampshire to the coast of south carolina  and then a few million of you stood up from savannah to seattle  from boise to baton rouge  and tonight  because of you   because of a movement you built that stretches from vermont's green mountains to the streets of san antonio  we can stand up with confidence and clarity to say that we are turning the page  and we are ready to write the next great chapter in america's story  in the coming weeks  we will begin a great debate about the future of this country with a man who has served it bravely and loves it dearly  and tonight  i called john mccain and congratulated him on winning the republican nomination  but in this election  we will offer two very different visions of the america we see in the twenty first century  because john mccain may claim long history of straight talk and independent thinking  and i respect that  but in this campaign  he's fallen in line behind the very same policies that have ill served america  he has seen where george bush has taken our country  and he promises to keep us on the very same course  it's the same course that threatens a century of war in iraq   a third and fourth and fifth tour of duty for brave troops who've done all we've asked them to  even while we ask little and expect nothing of the iraqi government whose job it is to put their country back together  a course where we spend billions of dollars a week that could be used to rebuild our roads and our schools  to care for our veterans and send our children to college  it's the same course that continues to divide and isolate america from the world by substituting bluster and bullying for direct diplomacy   by ignoring our allies and refusing to talk to our enemies even though presidents from kennedy to reagan have done just that  because strong countries and strong leaders aren't afraid to tell hard truths to petty dictators  and it's the same course that offers the same tired answer to workers without health care and families without homes  to students in debt and children who go to bed hungry in the richest nation on earth   four more years of tax breaks for the biggest corporations and the wealthiest few who don't need them and aren't even asking for them  it's a course that further divides wall street from main street  where struggling families are told to pull themselves up by their bootstraps because there's nothing government can do or should do   and so we should give more to those with the most and let the chips fall where they may  well we are here tonight to say that this is not the america we believe in and this is not the future we want  we want a new course for this country  we want new leadership in washington  we want change in america  john mccain and senator clinton echo each other in dismissing this call for change  they say it is eloquent but empty  speeches and not solutions  and yet  they should know that it's a call that did not begin with my words  it began with words that were spoken on the floors of factories in ohio and across the deep plains of texas  words that came from classrooms in south carolina and living rooms in the state of iowa  from first time voters and life long cynics  from democrats and republicans alike  they should know that there's nothing empty about the call for affordable health care that came from the young student who told me she gets three hours of sleep because she works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't pay her sister's medical bills  there's nothing empty about the call for help that came from the mother in san antonio who saw her mortgage double in two weeks and didn't know where her two year olds would sleep at night when they were kicked out of their home  there's nothing empty about the call for change that came from the elderly woman who wants it so badly that she sent me an envelope with a money order for   and a simple verse of scripture tucked inside  these americans know that government cannot solve all of our problems  and they don't expect it to  americans know that we have to work harder and study more to compete in a global economy  we know that we need to take responsibility for ourselves and our children   that we need to spend more time with them  and teach them well  and put a book in their hands instead of a video game once in awhile  we know this  but we also believe that there is a larger responsibility we have to one another as americans  we believe that we rise or fall as one nation   as one people  that we are our brother's keeper  that we are our sister's keeper  we believe that a child born tonight should have the same chances whether she arrives in the barrios of san antonio or the suburbs of st  louis  on the streets of chicago or the hills of appalachia  we believe that when she goes to school for the first time  it should be in a place where the rats don't outnumber the computers  that when she applies to college  cost is no barrier to a degree that will allow her to compete with children in china or india for the jobs of the twenty first century  we believe that these jobs should provide wages that can raise her family  health care for when she gets sick and a pension for when she retires  we believe that when she tucks her own children into bed  she should feel safe knowing that they are protected from the threats we face by the bravest  best equipped  military in the world  led by a commander in chief who has the judgment to know when to send them into battle and which battlefield to fight on  and if that child should ever get the chance to travel the world  and someone should ask her where she is from  we believe that she should always be able to hold her head high with pride in her voice when she answers  i am an american  that is the course we seek  that is the change we are calling for  you can call it many things  but you cannot call it empty  if i am the nominee of this party  i will not allow us to be distracted by the same politics that seeks to divide us with false charges and meaningless labels  in this campaign  we will not stand for the politics that uses religion as a wedge  and patriotism as a bludgeon  i owe what i am to this country i love  and i will never forget it  where else could a young man who grew up herding goats in kenya get the chance to fulfill his dream of a college education  where else could he marry a white girl from kansas whose parents survived war and depression to find opportunity out west  where else could they have a child who would one day have the chance to run for the highest office in the greatest nation the world has ever known  where else  but in the united states of america  it is now my hope and our task to set this country on a course that will keep this promise alive in the twenty first century  and the eyes of the world are watching to see if we can  there is a young man on my campaign whose grandfather lives in uganda  he is   years old and has never experienced true democracy in his lifetime  during the reign of idi amin  he was literally hunted and the only reason he escaped was thanks to the kindness of others and a few good sized trunks  and on the night of the iowa caucuses  that  year old man stayed up until five in the morning  huddled by his television  waiting for the results  the world is watching what we do here  the world is paying attention to how we conduct ourselves  what will we they see  what will we tell them  what will we show them  can we come together across party and region  race and religion to restore prosperity and opportunity as the birthright of every american  can we lead the community of nations in taking on the common threats of the  st century   terrorism and climate change  genocide and disease  can we send a message to all those weary travelers beyond our shores who long to be free from fear and want that the united states of america is  and always will be   the last best  hope of earth ' we say  we hope  we believe   yes we can "], ["obama1", "it is my privilege to be joined by some of the distinguished generals and admirals supporting my campaign  they have defended the american people and stood up for american values with honor and distinction  between them they have served nine commanders in chief  and i look forward to continuing to draw on their counsel throughout my campaign and beyond  as as a candidate for the presidency  i know that i am running to be commander in chief   to safeguard this nation's security  and to keep our sacred trust with the men and women who serve  there is no responsibility that i take more seriously  this is something that i've talked about throughout this campaign  because i believe that any candidate for president must present the american people with a clear vision of how we will lead  there are real differences between the candidates  and important issues to debate   from ending the war in iraq  to combating terrorism  to devising new strategies and new capabilities to confront  st century threats  but recently  we've seen a different kind of approach  instead of a serious  substantive debate  we've heard vague allusions to a  commander in chief threshold  that seems to be about nothing more than the number of years you've spent in washington  this is exactly what's wrong with the national security debate in washington  after years of a divisive politics that uses national security as a wedge to drive us apart  how much longer do we have to wait to bring this country together to confront our common enemies  after years of being told that democrats have to talk  act and vote like john mccain to pass some commander in chief test  how many times do we have to learn that tough talk is not a substitute for sound judgment  after years of a war in iraq that should've never been authorized  how many more politicians will appeal to the american peoples' fears instead of their hopes  this moment   in this election   is our chance to put an end to a divisive politics that has done nothing to keep america safe  or to serve our men and women in uniform as well as they are serving us  because the real commander in chief threshold doesn't have to do with years tallied up in washington  it has to do with the judgment and vision that you will bring to the oval office  on the most important national security question since the cold war  i am the only candidate who opposed the war in iraq from the beginning  this judgment was not about speeches  it was about whether or not the united states of america would go to war in iraq  because we did  we took our eye off al qaeda  we have lost thousands of lives and spent hundreds of billions of dollars  our military is overstretched  and our security and standing has been set back  so don't tell me that the decision to go to war was just a speech  because it was far more than that to the men and women who have served   and continue to serve heroically in iraq  when i spoke out against the war  i said that i was not opposed to all wars  in fact  one of the central reasons why i opposed going to war in iraq is that we had yet to finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban  that remains true today  that is why i have consistently called for an increased commitment to afghanistan  and why i called last august for at least two additional combat brigades to support our mission there  and that is why i will end the war in iraq when i am president  and focus on finishing the job in afghanistan  i will never hesitate to defend this country and our critical interests  that is why i am the only candidate who has made it clear that we cannot tolerate any safe haven for terrorists who threaten america  but we must also use all elements of national power to combat the threats of the  st century  and that means deploying the power of american diplomacy before we deploy our troops  that is why we must be willing to talk to the leaders of all nations   friend and foe  the threats we face are increasingly unconventional  and they call for new approaches  i have worked on the senate foreign relations committee to combat the challenges of the  st century   securing loose weapons and nuclear materials from terrorists  working to stop ethnic killing and genocide in africa  and investing in our ability to combat epidemic diseases like avian flu that can be deadly at home and sew instability abroad  and one theme that i hear in talking to military officers   whether generals and admirals  or the mid level officers who will lead tomorrow's military   is that we need new capabilities to respond to this century's new threats  we must maintain our overwhelming conventional advantage   and i will  we also need to increase the size of our ground forces by   soldiers and   marines to relieve the strain on our troops  and to increase our capacity to put boots on the ground  we need to invest in capabilities like civil affairs  foreign languages  and training foreign militaries  so that we can confront nimble enemies  we need to give our civilian agencies the ability to operate alongside our military in post conflict zones and on humanitarian missions  and we must inspire a new generation of americans to serve their country  in the military and in a civilian capacity  and let me be very clear  when i am commander in chief  i will seek out  listen to  and respect the views of military commanders  under this administration  too often we have seen civilian control turned into an expectation that the uniformed military will be punished if they tell the president what he needs to know  rather than what he wants to hear  when i am president  the buck will stop with me  but we will restore trust and open dialogue between the military and civilian leadership  finally  it is the sacred obligation of any commander in chief to give the men and women who have served the care and support they have earned  that is what i have tried to do on the senate veterans affairs committee   working to improve care and benefits for wounded warriors and their families  and to enhance screening and treatment for ptsd and traumatic brain injury  the signature wounds of the wars in iraq and afghanistan  as president  i will ask myself every day whether i am serving our troops and veterans as well as they have served america  that means only sending them into harm's way when we absolutely must  providing them with a clear mission and the equipment they need to do the job  standing by them when they come home  and helping them live their dreams after they leave the service  like the men who have joined me on this stage today  my story is only possible in america  it is the story of my grandfather  who marched in patton's army  and my father  who crossed the globe to be a part of the dream that my grandfather defended  an america that secures its people  and stands as a light of hope for the world  that is the america that i will defend as commander in chief  drawing on the counsel of military commanders and the courage and conviction of the american people  an america where we meet the challenges of the  st century with sound judgment  clear plans  and a common purpose "], ["obama1", "just before america's entry into world war i  president woodrow wilson addressed congress   it is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war  he said   but the right is more precious than peace  wilson's words captured two awesome responsibilities that test any commander in chief   to never hesitate to defend america  but to never go to war unless you must  war is sometimes necessary  but it has grave consequences  and the judgment to go to war can never be undone  five years ago today  president george w  bush addressed the nation  bombs had started to rain down on baghdad  war was necessary  the president said  because the united states could not   live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder  recalling the pain of   he said the price of inaction in iraq was to meet the threat with  armies of fire fighters and police and doctors on the streets of our cities  at the time the president uttered those words  there was no hard evidence that iraq had those stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction  there was not any evidence that iraq was responsible for the attacks of september   or that iraq had operational ties to the al qaeda terrorists who carried them out  by launching a war based on faulty premises and bad intelligence  president bush failed wilson's test  so did congress when it voted to give him the authority to wage war  five years have gone by since that fateful decision  this war has now lasted longer than world war i  world war ii  or the civil war  nearly four thousand americans have given their lives  thousands more have been wounded  even under the best case scenarios  this war will cost american taxpayers well over a trillion dollars  and where are we for all of this sacrifice  we are less safe and less able to shape events abroad  we are divided at home  and our alliances around the world have been strained  the threats of a new century have roiled the waters of peace and stability  and yet america remains anchored in iraq  history will catalog the reasons why we waged a war that didn't need to be fought  but two stand out  in   when the fateful decisions about iraq were made  there was a president for whom ideology overrode pragmatism  and there were too many politicians in washington who spent too little time reading the intelligence reports  and too much time reading public opinion  the lesson of iraq is that when we are making decisions about matters as grave as war  we need a policy rooted in reason and facts  not ideology and politics  now we are debating who should be our next commander in chief  and i am running for president because it's time to turn the page on a failed ideology and a fundamentally flawed political strategy  so that we can make pragmatic judgments to keep our country safe  that's what i did when i stood up and opposed this war from the start  and said that we needed to finish the fight against al qaeda  and that's what i'll do as president of the united states  senator clinton says that she and senator mccain have passed a  commander in chief test    not because of the judgments they've made  but because of the years they've spent in washington  she made a similar argument when she said her vote for war was based on her experience at both ends of pennsylvania avenue  but here is the stark reality  there is a security gap in this country   a gap between the rhetoric of those who claim to be tough on national security  and the reality of growing insecurity caused by their decisions  a gap between washington experience  and the wisdom of washington's judgments  a gap between the rhetoric of those who tout their support for our troops  and the overburdened state of our military  it is time to have a debate with john mccain about the future of our national security  and the way to win that debate is not to compete with john mccain over who has more experience in washington  because that's a contest that he'll win  the way to win a debate with john mccain is not to talk  and act  and vote like him on national security  because then we all lose  the way to win that debate and to keep america safe is to offer a clear contrast  and that's what i will do when i am the nominee of the democratic party   because since before this war in iraq began  i have made different judgments  i have a different vision  and i will offer a clean break from the failed policies and politics of the past  nowhere is that break more badly needed than in iraq  in the year since president bush announced the surge   the bloodiest year of the war for america   the level of violence in iraq has been reduced  our troops   including so many from fort bragg and pope air force base   have done a brilliant job under difficult circumstances  yet while we have a general who has used improved tactics to reduce violence  we still have the wrong strategy  as general petraeus has himself acknowledged  the iraqis are not achieving the political progress needed to end their civil war  beyond iraq  our military is badly overstretched  and we have neither the strategy nor resources to deal with nearly every other national security challenge we face  this is why the judgment that matters most on iraq   and on any decision to deploy military force   is the judgment made first  if you believe we are fighting the right war  then the problems we face are purely tactical in nature  that is what senator mccain wants to discuss   tactics  what he and the administration have failed to present is an overarching strategy  how the war in iraq enhances our long term security  or will in the future  that's why this administration cannot answer the simple question posed by senator john warner in hearings last year  are we safer because of this war  and that is why senator mccain can argue   as he did last year   that we couldn't leave iraq because violence was up  and then argue this year that we can't leave iraq because violence is down  when you have no overarching strategy  there is no clear definition of success  success comes to be defined as the ability to maintain a flawed policy indefinitely  here is the truth  fighting a war without end will not force the iraqis to take responsibility for their own future  and fighting in a war without end will not make the american people safer  so when i am commander in chief  i will set a new goal on day one  i will end this war  not because politics compels it  not because our troops cannot bear the burden  as heavy as it is  but because it is the right thing to do for our national security  and it will ultimately make us safer  in order to end this war responsibly  i will immediately begin to remove our troops from iraq  we can responsibly remove   to   combat brigades each month  if we start with the number of brigades we have in iraq today  we can remove all of them   months  after this redeployment  we will leave enough troops in iraq to guard our embassy and diplomats  and a counter terrorism force to strike al qaeda if it forms a base that the iraqis cannot destroy  what i propose is not   and never has been   a precipitous drawdown  it is instead a detailed and prudent plan that will end a war nearly seven years after it started  my plan to end this war will finally put pressure on iraq's leaders to take responsibility for their future  because we've learned that when we tell iraq's leaders that we'll stay as long as it takes  they take as long as they want  we need to send a different message  we will help iraq reach a meaningful accord on national reconciliation  we will engage with every country in the region   and the un   to support the stability and territorial integrity of iraq  and we will launch a major humanitarian initiative to support iraq's refugees and people  but iraqis must take responsibility for their country  it is precisely this kind of approach   an approach that puts the onus on the iraqis  and that relies on more than just military power   that is needed to stabilize iraq  let me be clear  ending this war is not going to be easy  there will be dangers involved  we will have to make tactical adjustments  listening to our commanders on the ground  to ensure that our interests in a stable iraq are met  and to make sure that our troops are secure  senator clinton has tried to use my position to score political points  suggesting that i am somehow less committed to ending the war  she makes this argument despite the fact that she has taken the same position in the past  so ask yourself  who do you trust to end a war   someone who opposed the war from the beginning  or someone who started opposing it when they started preparing a run for president  now we know what we'll hear from those like john mccain who support open ended war  they will argue that leaving iraq is surrender  that we are emboldening the enemy  these are the mistaken and misleading arguments we hear from those who have failed to demonstrate how the war in iraq has made us safer  just yesterday  we heard senator mccain confuse sunni and shiite  iran and al qaeda  maybe that is why he voted to go to war with a country that had no al qaeda ties  maybe that is why he completely fails to understand that the war in iraq has done more to embolden america's enemies than any strategic choice that we have made in decades  the war in iraq has emboldened iran  which poses the greatest challenge to american interests in the middle east in a generation  continuing its nuclear program and threatening our ally  israel  instead of the new middle east we were promised  hamas runs gaza  hizbollah flags fly from the rooftops in sadr city  and iran is handing out money left and right in southern lebanon  the war in iraq has emboldened north korea  which built new nuclear weapons and even tested one before the administration finally went against its own rhetoric  and pursued diplomacy  the war in iraq has emboldened the taliban  which has rebuilt its strength since we took our eye off of afghanistan  above all  the war in iraq has emboldened al qaeda  whose recruitment has jumped and whose leadership enjoys a safe haven in pakistan   a thousand miles from iraq  the central front in the war against terror is not iraq  and it never was  what more could america's enemies ask for than an endless war where they recruit new followers and try out new tactics on a battlefield so far from their base of operations  that is why my presidency will shift our focus  rather than fight a war that does not need to be fought  we need to start fighting the battles that need to be won on the central front of the war against al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan  this is the area where the   attacks were planned  this is where osama bin laden and his top lieutenants still hide  this is where extremism poses its greatest threat  yet in both afghanistan and pakistan  we have pursued flawed strategies that are too distant from the needs of the people  and too timid in pursuit of our common enemies  it may not dominate the evening news  but in afghanistan  last year was the most deadly since   suicide attacks are up  casualties are up  corruption and drug trafficking are rampant  neither the government nor the legal economy can meet the needs of the afghan people  it is not too late to prevail in afghanistan  but we cannot prevail until we reduce our commitment in iraq  which will allow us to do what i called for last august   providing at least two additional combat brigades to support our efforts in afghanistan  this increased commitment in turn can be used to leverage greater assistance   with fewer restrictions   from our nato allies  it will also allow us to invest more in training afghan security forces  including more joint nato operations with the afghan army  and a national police training plan that is effectively coordinated and resourced  a stepped up military commitment must be backed by a long term investment in the afghan people  we will start with an additional   billion in non military assistance each year   aid that is focused on reaching ordinary afghans  we need to improve daily life by supporting education  basic infrastructure and human services  we have to counter the opium trade by supporting alternative livelihoods for afghan farmers  and we must call on more support from friends and allies  and better coordination under a strong international coordinator  to succeed in afghanistan  we also need to fundamentally rethink our pakistan policy  for years  we have supported stability over democracy in pakistan  and gotten neither  the core leadership of al qaeda has a safe haven in pakistan  the taliban are able to strike inside afghanistan and then return to the mountains of the pakistani border  throughout pakistan  domestic unrest has been rising  the full democratic aspirations of the pakistani people have been too long denied  a child growing up in pakistan  more often than not  is taught to see america as a source of hate   not hope  this is why i stood up last summer and said we cannot base our entire pakistan policy on president musharraf  pakistan is our ally  but we do our own security and our ally no favors by supporting its president while we are seen to be ignoring the interests of the people  our counter terrorism assistance must be conditioned on pakistani action to root out the al qaeda sanctuary  and any u s  aid not directly needed for the fight against al qaeda or to invest in the pakistani people should be conditioned on the full restoration of pakistan's democracy and rule of law  the choice is not between musharraf and islamic extremists  as the recent legislative elections showed  there is a moderate majority of pakistanis  and they are the people we need on our side to win the war against al qaeda  that is why we should dramatically increase our support for the pakistani people   for education  economic development  and democratic institutions  that child in pakistan must know that we want a better life for him  that america is on his side  and that his interest in opportunity is our interest as well  that's the promise that america must stand for  and for his sake and ours  we cannot tolerate a sanctuary for terrorists who threaten america's homeland and pakistan's stability  if we have actionable intelligence about high level al qaeda targets in pakistan's border region  we must act if pakistan will not or cannot  senator clinton  senator mccain  and president bush have all distorted and derided this position  suggesting that i would invade or bomb pakistan  this is politics  pure and simple  my position  in fact  is the same pragmatic policy that all three of them have belatedly   if tacitly   acknowledged is one we should pursue  indeed  it was months after i called for this policy that a top al qaeda leader was taken out in pakistan by an american aircraft  and remember that the same three individuals who now criticize me for supporting a targeted strike on the terrorists who carried out the   attacks  are the same three individuals that supported an invasion of iraq   a country that had nothing to do with   it is precisely this kind of political point scoring that has opened up the security gap in this country  we have a security gap when candidates say they will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell  but refuse to follow him where he actually goes  what we need in our next commander in chief is not a stubborn refusal to acknowledge reality or empty rhetoric about  am phone calls  what we need is a pragmatic strategy that focuses on fighting our real enemies  rebuilding alliances  and renewing our engagement with the world's people  in addition to freeing up resources to take the fight to al qaeda  ending the war in iraq will allow us to more effectively confront other threats in the world   threats that cannot be conquered with an occupying army or dispatched with a single decision in the middle of the night  what lies in the heart of a child in pakistan matters as much as the airplanes we sell her government  what's in the head of a scientist from russia can be as lethal as a plutonium reactor in yongbyon  what's whispered in refugee camps in chad can be as dangerous as a dictator's bluster  these are the neglected landscapes of the  st century  where technology and extremism empower individuals just as they give governments the ability to repress them  where the ancient divides of region and religion wash into the swift currents of globalization  without american leadership  these threats will fester  with strong american leadership  we can shape them into opportunities to protect our common security and advance our common humanity   for it has always been the genius of american leadership to find opportunity embedded in adversity  to focus on a source of fear  and confront it with hope  here are just five ways in which a shift in strategy away from iraq will help us address the critical challenges of the  st century  first  in addressing global terror and violent extremism  we need the kind of comprehensive counter terrorism strategy i called for last august  we need to strengthen security partnerships to take out terrorist networks  while investing in education and opportunity  we need to give our national security agencies the tools they need  while restoring the adherence to rule of law that helps us win the battle for hearts and minds  this means closing guantanamo  restoring habeas corpus  and respecting civil liberties  and we need to support the forces of moderation in the islamic world  so that alliances of convenience mature into friendships of conviction  second  the threat of nuclear proliferation must serve as a call to action  i have worked across the aisle with richard lugar and chuck hagel in the senate to secure dangerous weapons and loose nuclear materials  and as president  i will secure all loose nuclear materials around the world in my first term  seek deep cuts in global nuclear arsenals  strengthen the nuclear non proliferation treaty  and once more seek a world without nuclear weapons  third  the danger of weak and failed states risks spreading poverty and refugees  genocide and disease  now is the time to meet the goal of cutting extreme poverty in half  in part by doubling our foreign assistance while demanding more from those who receive it  and now is the time to build the capacity of regional partners in conflict prevention  peacekeeping  and the reconstruction of ravaged societies  fourth  the catastrophic consequences of the global climate crisis are matched by the promise of collective action  now is the time for america to lead  because if we take action  others will act as well  through our own cap and trade system and investments in new sources of energy  we can end our dependence on foreign oil and gas  and free ourselves from the tyranny of oil rich states from saudi arabia to russia to venezuela  we can create millions of new jobs here in america  and we can secure our planet for our children and grandchildren  and fifth  america's sluggish economy risks ceding our economic prominence to a rising china  competition has always been a catalyst for american innovation  and now should be no different  we must invest in the education of our children  renew our leadership in science  and advance trade that is not just free  but fair for our workers  we must ensure that america is the economic engine in the  st century just as we were in the  th  i have no illusions that any of this will be easy  but i do know that we can only begin to make these changes when we end the mindset that focuses on iraq and ignores the rest of the world  i also know that meeting these new threats will require a president who deploys the power of tough  principled diplomacy  it is time to present a country like iran with a clear choice  if it abandons its nuclear program  support for terror  and threats to israel  then iran can rejoin the community of nations   with all the benefits that entails  if not  iran will face deeper isolation and steeper sanctions  when we engage directly  we will be in a stronger position to rally real international support for increased pressure  we will also engender more goodwill from the iranian people  and make no mistake   if and when we ever have to use military force against any country  we must exert the power of american diplomacy first  once again  senator clinton  senator mccain  and president bush have made the same arguments against my position on diplomacy  as if reading from the same political playbook  they say i'll be penciling the world's dictators on to my social calendar  but just as they are misrepresenting my position  they are mistaken in standing up for a policy of not talking that is not working  what i've said is that we cannot seize opportunities to resolve our problems unless we create them  that is what kennedy did with khrushchev  what nixon did with mao  what reagan did with gorbachev  and that is what i will do as president of the united states  what i have talked about today is a new strategy  a new set of priorities for pursuing our interests in the  st century  and as president  i will provide the tools required to implement this strategy  when president truman put the policy of containment in place  he also invested in and organized our government to carry it out  creating the national security council and the cia  and founding nato  now  we must upgrade our tools of power to fit a new strategy  that starts with enhancing the finest military in the history of the world  as commander in chief  i will begin by giving a military overstretched by iraq the support it needs  it is time to reduce the strain on our troops by completing the effort to increase our ground forces by   soldiers and   marines  while ensuring the quality of our troops  in an age marked by technology  it is the people of our military   our soldiers  sailors  airmen  marines  and coast guardsmen   who bear the responsibility for complex missions  that is why we need to ensure adequate training and time home between deployments  that is why we need to expand our special forces  and that is why we must increase investments in capabilities like civil affairs and training foreign militaries  but we cannot place the burden of a new national security strategy on our military alone  we must integrate our diplomatic  information  economic and military power  that is why  as soon as i take office  i will call for a national strategy and security review  to help determine a  st century inter agency structure to integrate the elements of our national power  in addition  i will invest in our civilian capacity to operate alongside our troops in post conflict zones and on humanitarian and stabilization missions  instead of shuttering consulates in tough corners of the world  it's time to grow our foreign service and to expand usaid  instead of giving up on the determination of young people to serve  it's time to double the size of our peace corps  instead of letting people learn about america from enemy propaganda  it's time to recruit  train  and send out into the world an america's voice corps  and while we strengthen our own capacity  we must strengthen the capability of the international community  we honor nato's sacrifice in afghanistan  but we must strive to make it a larger and more nimble alliance  we must work with powers like russia and china  but we must also speak up for human rights and democracy   and we can start now by speaking out for the human rights and religious freedom of the people of tibet  and while we are frustrated by the un  we must invest in its capability to keep the peace  resolve disputes  monitor disarmament  and support good governance around the world   and that depends on a more engaged united states  we are at a defining moment in our history  we can choose the path of unending war and unilateral action  and sap our strength and standing  we can choose the path of disengagement  and cede our leadership  or  we can meet fear and danger head on with hope and strength  with common purpose as a united america  and with common cause with old allies and new partners  what we've seen these last few years is what happens when the rigid ideology and dysfunctional politics of washington is projected abroad  an ideology that does not fit the shape of the times cannot shape events in foreign countries  a politics that is based on fear and division does not allow us to call on the world to hope  and keeps us from coming together as one people  as one nation  to write the next great chapter in the american story  we also know that there is another face of america that we have seen these last five years  from down the road at fort bragg  our soldiers have gone abroad with a greater sense of common purpose than their leaders in washington  they have learned the lessons of the  st century's wars  and they have shown a sense of service and selflessness that represents the very best of the american character  this must be the election when we stand up and say that we will serve them as well as they have served us  this must be the election when america comes together behind a common purpose on behalf of our security and our values  that is what we do as americans  it's how we founded a republic based on freedom  and faced down fascism  it's how we defended democracy through a cold war  and shined a light of hope bright enough to be seen in the darkest corners of the world  when america leads with principle and pragmatism  hope can triumph over fear  it is time  once again  for america to lead "], ["obama1", "five years ago  the war in iraq began  and on this fifth anniversary  we honor the brave men and women who are serving this nation in iraq  afghanistan  and around the world  we pay tribute to the sacrifices of their families back home  and a grateful nation mourns the loss of our fallen heroes  i understand that the first serviceman killed in iraq was a native west virginian  marine  st lieutenant shane childers  who died five years ago tomorrow  and so on this anniversary  my thoughts and prayers go out to lieutenant childers' family  and to all who've lost loved ones in iraq and afghanistan  the costs of war are greatest for the troops and those who love them  but we know that war has other costs as well  yesterday  i addressed some of these other costs in a speech on the strategic consequences of the iraq war  i spoke about how this war has diverted us from fighting al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan  and from addressing the other challenges of the  st century  violent extremism and nuclear weapons  climate change and poverty  genocide and disease  and today  i want to talk about another cost of this war   the toll it has taken on our economy  because at a time when we're on the brink of recession   when neighborhoods have for sale signs outside every home  and working families are struggling to keep up with rising costs   ordinary americans are paying a price for this war  when you're spending over   to fill up your car because the price of oil is four times what it was before iraq  you're paying a price for this war  when iraq is costing each household about   a month  you're paying a price for this war  when a national guard unit is over in iraq and can't help out during a hurricane in louisiana or with floods here in west virginia  our communities are paying a price for this war  and the price our families and communities are paying reflects the price america is paying  the most conservative estimates say that iraq has now cost more than half a trillion dollars  more than any other war in our history besides world war ii  some say the true cost is even higher and that by the time it's over  this could be a   trillion war  but what no one disputes is that the cost of this war is far higher than what we were told it would be  we were told this war would cost   to   billion  and that reconstruction would pay for itself out of iraqi oil profits  we were told higher estimates were nothing but  baloney  like so much else about this war  we were not told the truth  what no one disputes is that the costs of this war have been compounded by its careless and incompetent execution   from the billions that have vanished in iraq to the billions more in no bid contracts for reckless contractors like halliburton  what no one disputes is that five years into this war  soldiers up at fort drum are having to wait more than a month to get their first mental health screening   even though we know that incidences of ptsd skyrocket between the second  third  and fourth tours of duty  we have a sacred trust to our troops and our veterans  and we have to live up to it  what no one disputes is that president bush has done what no other president has ever done  and given tax cuts to the rich in a time of war  john mccain once opposed these tax cuts   he rightly called them unfair and fiscally irresponsible  but now he has done an about face and wants to make them permanent  just like he wants a permanent occupation in iraq  no matter what the costs  no matter what the consequences  john mccain seems determined to carry out a third bush term  that's an outcome america can't afford  because of the bush mccain policies  our debt has ballooned  this is creating problems in our fragile economy  and that kind of debt also places an unfair burden on our children and grandchildren  who will have to repay it  it also means we're having to pay for this war with loans from china  having china as our banker isn't good for our economy  it isn't good for our global leadership  and it isn't good for our national security  history teaches us that for a nation to remain a preeminent military power  it must remain a preeminent economic power  that is why it is so important to manage the costs of war wisely  this is a lesson that the first president bush understood  the conduct of the gulf war cost america less than   billion   what we pay in two months in iraq today  that's because that war was prosecuted on solid grounds  and in a responsible way  and with the support of allies  who paid most of the costs  none of this has been the case in the way george w  bush and john mccain have waged the current iraq war  now  at that debate in texas several weeks ago  senator clinton attacked john mccain for supporting the policies that have led to our enormous war costs  but her point would have been more compelling had she not joined senator mccain in making the tragically ill considered decision to vote for the iraq war in the first place  the truth is  this is all part of the reason i opposed this war from the start  it's why i said back in   that it could lead to an occupation not just of undetermined length or undetermined consequences  but of undetermined costs  it's why i've said this war should have never been authorized and never been waged  now  let me be clear  when i am president  i will spare no expense to ensure that our troops have the equipment and support they need  there is no higher obligation for a commander in chief  but we also have to understand that the more than   billion we're spending each month in iraq is money we could be investing here at home  just think about what battles we could be fighting instead of fighting this misguided war  instead of fighting this war  we could be fighting the terrorists who attacked us on   and who are plotting against us in afghanistan and pakistan  we could be securing our homeland and stopping the world's most dangerous weapons from falling into terrorist hands  instead of fighting this war  we could be fighting for the people of west virginia  for what folks in this state have been spending on the iraq war  we could be giving health care to nearly   of your neighbors  hiring nearly   new elementary school teachers  and making college more affordable for over   students  we could be fighting to put the american dream within reach for every american   by giving tax breaks to working families  offering relief to struggling homeowners  reversing president bush's cuts to the manufacturing extension partnership  and protecting social security today  tomorrow  and forever  that's what we could be doing instead of fighting this war  instead of fighting this war  we could be fighting to make universal health care a reality in this country  we could be fighting for the young woman who works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't afford medicine for a sister who's ill  for what we spend in several months in iraq  we could be providing them with the quality  affordable health care that every american deserves  instead of fighting this war  we could be fighting to give every american a quality education  we could be fighting for the young men and women all across this country who dream big dreams but aren't getting the kind of education they need to reach for those dreams  for a fraction of what we're spending each year in iraq  we could be giving our teachers more pay and more support  rebuilding our crumbling schools  and offering a tax credit to put a college degree within reach for anyone who wants one  instead of fighting this war  we could be fighting to rebuild our roads and bridges  i've proposed a fund that would do just that and generate nearly two million new jobs   many in the construction industry that's been hard hit by our housing crisis  and it would cost just six percent of what we spend each year in iraq  instead of fighting this war  we could be freeing ourselves from the tyranny of oil  and saving this planet for our children  we could be investing in renewable sources of energy  and in clean coal technology  and creating up to   million new green jobs in the bargain  including new clean coal jobs  and we could be doing it all for the cost of less than a year and a half in iraq  these are the investments we could be making  all within the parameters of a more responsible and disciplined budget  this is the future we could be building  and that is why i will bring this war to an end when i'm president of the united states of america  but we also know that even after this war comes to an end  the costs of this war will not  we'll have to keep our sacred trust with our veterans and fully fund the va  we'll have to look after our wounded warriors   whether they're suffering from wounds seen or unseen  that must include the signature injuries of the wars in iraq and afghanistan   not just ptsd  but traumatic brain injury  we'll have to give veterans the health care and disability benefits they deserve  the support they need  and the respect they've earned  this is an obligation i have fought to uphold on the senate veterans' affairs committee by joining jay rockefeller to expand educational opportunities for our veterans  it's an obligation i will uphold as president  and it's an obligation that will endure long after this war is over  and our obligation to rebuild our military will endure as well  this war has stretched our military to its limits  wearing down troops and equipment as a result of tour after tour after tour of duty  the army has said it will need   billion a year just to replace and repair all the equipment that's been broken or lost  so in the coming years we won't just have to restore our military to its peak level of readiness  and we won't just have to make sure our national guard is back to being fully prepared to handle a domestic crisis  we'll also have to ensure that our soldiers are trained and equipped to confront the new threats of the   century and that our military can meet any challenge around the world  and that is a responsibility i intend to meet as commander in chief  so we know what this war has cost us   in blood and in treasure  but in the words of robert kennedy   past error is no excuse for its own perpetuation  and yet  john mccain refuses to learn from the failures of the bush years  instead of offering an exit strategy for iraq  he's offering us a  year occupation  instead of offering an economic plan that works for working americans  he's supporting tax cuts for the wealthiest among us who don't need them and aren't asking for them  senator mccain is embracing the failed policies of the past  but america is ready to embrace the future  when i am your nominee  the american people will have a real choice in november   between change and more of the same  between giving the bush policies another four years  or bringing them to an end  and that is the choice the american people deserve  somewhere in baghdad today  a soldier is stepping into his humvee and heading out on a patrol  that soldier knows the cost of war  he's been bearing it for five years  it's the cost of being kept awake at night by the whistle of falling mortars  it's the cost of a heart that aches for a loved one back home  and a family that's counting the days until the next r amp r  it's the cost of losing a friend  who asked for nothing but to serve his country  how much longer are we going to ask our troops to bear the cost of this war  how much longer are we going to ask our families and our communities to bear the cost of this war  when are we going to stop mortgaging our children's future for washington's mistake  this election is our chance to reclaim our future   to end the fight in iraq and take up the fight for good jobs and universal health care  to end the fight in iraq and take up the fight for a world class education and retirement security  to end the fight in iraq and take up the fight for opportunity  and equality  and prosperity here at home  those are the battles we need to fight  that is the leadership i want to offer  and that is the future we can build together when i'm president of the united states  thank you "], ["obama1", "i want to thank mayor bloomberg for his extraordinary leadership  at a time when washington is divided in old ideological battles  he shows us what can be achieved when we bring people together to seek pragmatic solutions  not only has he been a remarkable leader for new york  he has established himself as a major voice in our national debate on issues like renewing our economy  educating our children  and seeking energy independence  mr  mayor  i share your determination to bring this country together to finally make progress for the american people  in a city of landmarks  we meet at cooper union  just uptown from federal hall  where george washington took the oath of office as the first president of the united states  with all the history that has passed through the narrow canyons of lower manhattan  it is worth taking a moment to reflect on the role that the market has played in the development of the american story  the great task before our founders that day was putting into practice the ideal that government could simultaneously serve liberty and advance the common good  for alexander hamilton  the young secretary of the treasury  that task was bound to the vigor of the american economy  hamilton had a strong belief in the power of the market  but he balanced that belief with the conviction that human enterprise  may be beneficially stimulated by prudent aids and encouragements on the part of the government  government  he believed  had an important role to play in advancing our common prosperity  so he nationalized the state revolutionary war debts  weaving together the economies of the states and creating an american system of credit and capital markets  and he encouraged manufacturing and infrastructure  so products could be moved to market  hamilton met fierce opposition from thomas jefferson  who worried that this brand of capitalism would favor the interests of the few over the many  jefferson preferred an agrarian economy because he believed that it would give individual landowners freedom  and that this freedom would nurture our democratic institutions  but despite their differences  there was one thing that jefferson and hamilton agreed on   that economic growth depended upon the talent and ingenuity of the american people  that in order to harness that talent  opportunity had to remain open to all  and that through education in particular  every american could climb the ladder of social and economic mobility  and achieve the american dream  in the more than two centuries since then  we have struggled to balance the same forces that confronted hamilton and jefferson   self interest and community  markets and democracy  the concentration of wealth and power  and the necessity of transparency and opportunity for each and every citizen  throughout this saga  americans have pursued their dreams within a free market that has been the engine of america's progress  it's a market that has created a prosperity that is the envy of the world  and opportunity for generations of americans  a market that has provided great rewards to the innovators and risk takers who have made america a beacon for science  and technology  and discovery  but the american experiment has worked in large part because we have guided the market's invisible hand with a higher principle  our free market was never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get  however you can get it  that is why we have put in place rules of the road to make competition fair  and open  and honest  we have done this not to stifle   but rather to advance prosperity and liberty  as i said at nasdaq last september  the core of our economic success is the fundamental truth that each american does better when all americans do better  that the well being of american business  its capital markets  and the american people are aligned  i think all of us here today would acknowledge that we've lost that sense of shared prosperity  this loss has not happened by accident  it's because of decisions made in boardrooms  on trading floors and in washington  under republican and democratic administrations  we failed to guard against practices that all too often rewarded financial manipulation instead of productivity and sound business practices  we let the special interests put their thumbs on the economic scales  the result has been a distorted market that creates bubbles instead of steady  sustainable growth  a market that favors wall street over main street  but ends up hurting both  nor is this trend new  the concentrations of economic power   and the failures of our political system to protect the american economy from its worst excesses   have been a staple of our past  most famously in the  s  when with success we ended up plunging the country into the great depression  that is when government stepped in to create a series of regulatory structures   from the fdic to the glass steagall act   to serve as a corrective to protect the american people and american business  ironically  it was in reaction to the high taxes and some of the outmoded structures of the new deal that both individuals and institutions began pushing for changes to this regulatory structure  but instead of sensible reform that rewarded success and freed the creative forces of the market  too often we've excused and even embraced an ethic of greed  corner cutting and inside dealing that has always threatened the long term stability of our economic system  too often  we've lost that common stake in each other's prosperity  let me be clear  the american economy does not stand still  and neither should the rules that govern it  the evolution of industries often warrants regulatory reform   to foster competition  lower prices  or replace outdated oversight structures  old institutions cannot adequately oversee new practices  old rules may not fit the roads where our economy is leading  there were good arguments for changing the rules of the road in the  s  our economy was undergoing a fundamental shift  carried along by the swift currents of technological change and globalization  for the sake of our common prosperity  we needed to adapt to keep markets competitive and fair  unfortunately  instead of establishing a  st century regulatory framework  we simply dismantled the old one   aided by a legal but corrupt bargain in which campaign money all too often shaped policy and watered down oversight  in doing so  we encouraged a winner take all  anything goes environment that helped foster devastating dislocations in our economy  deregulation of the telecommunications sector  for example  fostered competition but also contributed to massive over investment  partial deregulation of the electricity sector enabled market manipulation  companies like enron and worldcom took advantage of the new regulatory environment to push the envelope  pump up earnings  disguise losses and otherwise engage in accounting fraud to make their profits look better   a practice that led investors to question the balance sheet of all companies  and severely damaged public trust in capital markets  this was not the invisible hand at work  instead  it was the hand of industry lobbyists tilting the playing field in washington  an accounting industry that had developed powerful conflicts of interest  and a financial sector that fueled over investment  a decade later  we have deregulated the financial services sector  and we face another crisis  a regulatory structure set up for banks in the  s needed to change because the nature of business has changed  but by the time the glass steagall act was repealed in   the   million lobbying effort that drove deregulation was more about facilitating mergers than creating an efficient regulatory framework  since then  we have overseen  st century innovation   including the aggressive introduction of new and complex financial instruments like hedge funds and non bank financial companies   with outdated  th century regulatory tools  new conflicts of interest recalled the worst excesses of the past   like the outrageous news that we learned just yesterday of kpmg allowing a lender to report profits instead of losses  so that both parties could make a quick buck  not surprisingly  the regulatory environment failed to keep pace  when subprime mortgage lending took a reckless and unsustainable turn  a patchwork of regulators were unable or unwilling to protect the american people  the policies of the bush administration threw the economy further out of balance  tax cuts without end for the wealthiest americans  a trillion dollar war in iraq that didn't need to be fought  paid for with deficit spending and borrowing from foreign creditors like china  a complete disdain for pay as you go budgeting   coupled with a generally scornful attitude towards oversight and enforcement   allowed far too many to put short term gain ahead of long term consequences  the american economy was bound to suffer a painful correction  and policymakers found themselves with fewer resources to deal with the consequences  today  those consequences are clear  i see them in every corner of our great country  as families face foreclosure and rising costs  i seem them in towns across america  where a credit crisis threatens the ability of students to get loans  and states can't finance infrastructure projects  i see them here in manhattan  where one of our biggest investment banks had to be bailed out  and the fed opened its discount window to a host of new institutions with unprecedented implications we have yet to appreciate  when all is said and done  losses will be in the many hundreds of billions  what was bad for main street was bad for wall street  pain trickled up  that is why the principle that i spoke about at nasdaq is even more urgently true today  in our  st century economy  there is no dividing line between main street and wall street  the decisions made in new york's high rises have consequences for americans across the country  and whether those americans can make their house payments  whether they keep their jobs  or spend confidently without falling into debt   that has consequences for the entire market  the future cannot be shaped by the best connected lobbyists with the best record of raising money for campaigns  this thinking is wrong for the financial sector and it's wrong for our country  i do not believe that government should stand in the way of innovation  or turn back the clock to an older era of regulation  but i do believe that government has a role to play in advancing our common prosperity  by providing stable macroeconomic and financial conditions for sustained growth  by demanding transparency  and by ensuring fair competition in the marketplace  our history should give us confidence that we don't have to choose between an oppressive government run economy and a chaotic and unforgiving capitalism  it tells us we can emerge from great economic upheavals stronger  not weaker  but we can do so only if we restore confidence in our markets  only if we rebuild trust between investors and lenders  and only if we renew that common interest between wall street and main street that is the key to our success  now  as most experts agree  our economy is in a recession  to renew our economy   and to ensure that we are not doomed to repeat a cycle of bubble and bust again and again   we need to address not only the immediate crisis in the housing market  we also need to create a  st century regulatory framework  and pursue a bold opportunity agenda for the american people  most urgently  we must confront the housing crisis  after months of inaction  the president spoke here in new york and warned against doing too much  his main proposal   extending tax cuts for the wealthiest americans   is completely divorced from the reality that people are facing around the country  john mccain recently announced his own plan  and it amounts to little more than watching this crisis happen  while this is consistent with senator mccain's determination to run for george bush's third term  it won't help families who are suffering  and it won't help lift our economy out of recession  over two million households are at risk of foreclosure and millions more have seen their home values plunge  many americans are walking away from their homes  which hurts property values for entire neighborhoods and aggravates the credit crisis  to stabilize the housing market and help bring the foreclosure crisis to an end  i have sponsored senator chris dodd's legislation creating a new fha housing security program  which will provide meaningful incentives for lenders to buy or refinance existing mortgages  this will allow americans facing foreclosure to keep their homes at rates they can afford  senator mccain argues that government should do nothing to protect borrowers and lenders who've made bad decisions  or taken on excessive risk  on this point  i agree  but the dodd frank package is not a bailout for lenders or investors who gambled recklessly  as they will take losses  it is not a windfall for borrowers  as they will have to share any capital gain  instead  it offers a responsible and fair way to help bring an end to the foreclosure crisis  it asks both sides to sacrifice  while preventing a long term collapse that could have enormous ramifications for the most responsible lenders and borrowers  as well as the american people as a whole  that is what senator mccain ignores  for homeowners who were victims of fraud  i've also proposed a   billion foreclosure prevention fund that would help them sell a home that is beyond their means  or modify their loan to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy  it's also time to amend our bankruptcy laws  so families aren't forced to stick to the terms of a home loan that was predatory or unfair  to prevent fraud in the future  i've proposed tough new penalties on fraudulent lenders  and a home score system that will allow consumers to find out more about mortgage offers and whether they'll be able to make payments  to help low  and middle income families  i've proposed a   percent mortgage interest tax credit that will allow homeowners who don't itemize their taxes to access incentives for home ownership  and to expand home ownership  we must do more to help communities turn abandoned properties into affordable housing  the government can't do this alone  nor should it  as i said last september  lenders must get ahead of the curve rather than just reacting to crisis  they should actively look at all borrowers  offer workouts  and reduce the principal on mortgages in trouble  not only can this prevent the larger losses associated with foreclosure and resale  but it can reduce the extent of government intervention and taxpayer exposure  beyond dealing with the immediate housing crisis  it is time for the federal government to revamp the regulatory framework dealing with our financial markets  our capital markets have helped us build the strongest economy in the world  they are a source of competitive advantage for our country  but they cannot succeed without the public's trust  the details of regulatory reform should be developed through sound analysis and public debate  but there are several core principles for reform that i will pursue as president  first  if you can borrow from the government  you should be subject to government oversight and supervision  secretary paulson admitted this in his remarks yesterday  the federal reserve should have basic supervisory authority over any institution to which it may make credit available as a lender of last resort  when the fed steps in  it is providing lenders an insurance policy underwritten by the american taxpayer  in return  taxpayers have every right to expect that these institutions are not taking excessive risks  the nature of regulation should depend on the degree and extent of the fed's exposure  but at the very least  these new regulations should include liquidity and capital requirements  second  there needs to be general reform of the requirements to which all regulated financial institutions are subjected  capital requirements should be strengthened  particularly for complex financial instruments like some of the mortgage securities that led to our current crisis  we must develop and rigorously manage liquidity risk  we must investigate rating agencies and potential conflicts of interest with the people they are rating  and transparency requirements must demand full disclosure by financial institutions to shareholders and counterparties  as we reform our regulatory system at home  we must work with international arrangements like the basel committee on banking supervision  the international accounting standards board  and the financial stability forum to address the same problems abroad  the goal must be ensuring that financial institutions around the world are subject to similar rules of the road   both to make the system stable  and to keep our financial institutions competitive  third  we need to streamline a framework of overlapping and competing regulatory agencies  reshuffling bureaucracies should not be an end in itself  but the large  complex institutions that dominate the financial landscape do not fit into categories created decades ago  different institutions compete in multiple markets   our regulatory system should not pretend otherwise  a streamlined system will provide better oversight  and be less costly for regulated institutions  fourth  we need to regulate institutions for what they do  not what they are  over the last few years  commercial banks and thrift institutions were subject to guidelines on subprime mortgages that did not apply to mortgage brokers and companies  it makes no sense for the fed to tighten mortgage guidelines for banks when two thirds of subprime mortgages don't originate from banks  this regulatory framework has failed to protect homeowners  and it is now clear that it made no sense for our financial system  when it comes to protecting the american people  it should make no difference what kind of institution they are dealing with  fifth  we must remain vigilant and crack down on trading activity that crosses the line to market manipulation  reports have circulated in recent days that some traders may have intentionally spread rumors that bear stearns was in financial distress while making market bets against the company  the sec should investigate and punish this kind of market manipulation  and report its conclusions to congress  sixth  we need a process that identifies systemic risks to the financial system  too often  we deal with threats to the financial system that weren't anticipated by regulators  that's why we should create a financial market oversight commission  which would meet regularly and provide advice to the president  congress  and regulators on the state of our financial markets and the risks that face them  these expert views could help anticipate risks before they erupt into a crisis  these six principles should guide the legal reforms needed to establish a  st century regulatory system  but the change we need goes beyond laws and regulation   we need a shift in the cultures of our financial institutions and our regulatory agencies  financial institutions must do a better job at managing risks  there is something wrong when boards of directors or senior managers don't understand the implications of the risks assumed by their own institutions  it's time to realign incentives and compensation packages  so that both high level executives and employees better serve the interests of shareholders  and it's time to confront the risks that come with excessive complexity  even the best government regulation cannot fully substitute for internal risk management  for supervisory agencies  oversight must keep pace with innovation  as the subprime crisis unfolded  tough questions about new and complex financial instruments were not asked  as a result  the public interest was not protected  we do american business   and the american people   no favors when we turn a blind eye to excessive leverage and dangerous risks  finally  the american people must be able to trust that their government is looking out for all of us   not just those who donate to political campaigns  i fought in the senate for the most extensive ethics reform since watergate  i have refused contributions from federal lobbyists and pacs  and i have laid out far reaching plans that i intend to sign into law as president to bring transparency to government  and to end the revolving door between industries and the federal agencies that oversee them  once we deal with the immediate crisis in housing and strengthen the regulatory system governing our financial markets  our final task is to restore a sense of opportunity for all americans  the bedrock of our economic success is the american dream  it's a dream shared in big cities and small towns  across races  regions and religions   that if you work hard  you can support a family  that if you get sick  there will be health care you can afford  that you can retire with the dignity and security and respect that you have earned  that your kids can get a good education  and young people can go to college even if they're not rich  that is our common hope across this country  that is the american dream  but today  for far too many americans  this dream is slipping away  wall street has been gripped by increasing gloom over the last nine months  but for many american families  the economy has effectively been in recession for the past seven years  we have just come through the first sustained period of economic growth since world war ii that was not accompanied by a growth in incomes for typical families  americans are working harder for less  costs are rising  and it's not clear that we'll leave a legacy of opportunity to our children and grandchildren  that's why  throughout this campaign  i've put forward a series of proposals that will foster economic growth from the bottom up  and not just from the top down  that's why the last time i spoke on the economy here in new york  i talked about the need to put the policies of george w  bush behind us   policies that have essentially said to the american people   you are on your own  because we need to pursue policies that once again recognize that we are in this together  this starts with providing a stimulus that will reach the most vulnerable americans  including immediate relief to areas hardest hit by the housing crisis  and a significant extension of unemployment insurance for those who are out of work  if we can extend a hand to banks on wall street  we can extend a hand to americans who are struggling  beyond these short term measures  as president i will be committed to putting the american dream on a firmer footing  to reward work and make retirement secure  we'll provide an income tax cut of up to   for a working family  and eliminate income taxes altogether for any retiree making less than   per year  to make health care affordable for all americans  we'll cut costs and provide coverage to all who need it  to put more americans to work  we'll create millions of new green jobs and invest in rebuilding our nation's infrastructure  to extend opportunity  we'll invest in our schools and our teachers  and make college affordable for every american  and to ensure that america stays on the cutting edge  we'll expand broadband access  expand funding for basic scientific research  and pass comprehensive immigration reform so that we continue to attract the best and the brightest to our shores  i know that making these changes won't be easy  i will not pretend that this will come without cost  though i have presented ways we can achieve these changes in a fiscally responsible way  i know that we'll have to overcome our doubts and divisions and the determined opposition of powerful special interests before we can truly advance opportunity and prosperity for all americans  but i would not be running for president if i didn't think that this was a defining moment in our history  if we fail to overcome our divisions and continue to let special interest set the agenda  then america will fall behind  short term gains will continue to yield long term costs  opportunity will slip away on main street and prosperity will suffer here on wall street  but if we unite this country around a common purpose  if we act on the responsibilities that we have to each other and to our country  then we can launch a new era of opportunity and prosperity  i know we can do this because americans have done this before  time and again  we've recognized that common stake that we have in each other's success  that's how people as different as hamilton and jefferson came together to launch the world's greatest experiment in democracy  that's why our economy hasn't just been the world's greatest wealth creator   it's bound america together  it's created jobs  and it's made the dream of opportunity a reality for generations of americans  now it falls to us  we have as our inheritance the greatest economy the world has ever known  we have the responsibility to continue the work that began on that spring day over two centuries ago right here in manhattan   to renew our common purpose for a new century  and to write the next chapter in the story of america's success  we can do this  and we can begin this work today "], ["obama1", "we meet here at a time of challenge and uncertainty for america's workers  we all know the stories of shuttered plants and rusting factories  of industrial centers that have become near ghost towns across this state  and across this country  but today's gathering isn't the first time workers have met in philadelphia at a pivotal moment  one hundred and eighty one years ago  in the fall of   a group of mechanics met in the shadow of independence hall to form what they called the mechanics union of trade associations   a moment that marked the birth of the trade union movement in america  they met all kinds of resistance from employers and wealthy merchants who said what they were trying to do would hurt workers and business  and was just plain un american  but these mechanics   these founding fathers of organized labor   disagreed  and in the preamble to their constitution  they proposed what many believed was a radical idea   that it was in their employers' interests to pay them higher wages because higher wages for workers would help bring general prosperity for all  it was the  th century equivalent of the idea that what's good for main street is good for wall street  and that's an idea we need to remember today  because what we're seeing is that another  very different view has taken hold in washington and on wall street   the view that we can somehow thrive as a nation when those at the very top are doing better than ever  while ordinary americans are struggling to get by  over the last seven years  we've had an administration that serves the interests of the wealthy and the well connected  no matter what the cost to working families  and to our economy  it's an administration that didn't lift a finger while our economy rolled toward recession until the pain folks were feeling on main street trickled up to their friends on wall street  it's an administration that's been handing out tax cuts to the wealthiest americans who don't need them and aren't even asking for them  and it's an administration that denies labor a seat at the table when trade deals are being negotiated  that doesn't believe in unions  that doesn't believe in organizing  and that's packed the labor relations board with their corporate buddies  now  john mccain said a few weeks ago that  the issue of economics is not something i've understood as well as i should    and that's clear since all he's offering is more of the same bush policies that have put the american dream out of reach for so many americans  like george bush  senator mccain is committed to more tax cuts for the rich  and more trade agreements that fail to protect american workers  his response to the housing crisis amounts to little more than watching millions of americans face foreclosure  and some of his top advisors were lobbyists for the special interest when they went to work for his campaign  so it's not hard to guess who they'll be working for if they get into the white house  so while i know there's been some talk about whether the democrats will be unified in november  america can't afford another four years of the bush policies  and that's what john mccain's offering  and that's why i know we'll come together this fall to bring this country the change we so desperately need  but the truth is  the problems we face go beyond any single administration  for far too long  through both democratic and republican administrations  the system has been rigged against everyday americans by the lobbyists that wall street uses to get its way  think about it  the top mortgage lenders spend   million lobbying congress  and we wonder why washington looked the other way when they were tricking families into buying homes they couldn't afford  drug and insurance companies spend   billion on lobbying  and we're surprised that our health care premiums  and co pays  and the cost of prescription drugs goes up year after year after year  the big oil companies play the same game  and we wonder how they're making record profits at a time when you're paying close to   a gallon for gas  the system is broken   and over the weekend  we got a reminder of just how badly it's broken  you might have seen it  there was this news story about the top two executives at countrywide financial  a company that's as responsible as any firm for the housing crisis we're facing today  and what we learned is that when countrywide was sold a few months ago  these two executives got a combined   million dollars  so millions of americans are facing foreclosure  our economy is in turmoil  and the guys behind it all are getting bonuses for their bad behavior  that's an outrage  that's not the america we believe in  it's time to take on the special interests and level the playing field so that our economy works for working americans  now  i know there's been some talk about rocky balboa over the last couple days  and we all love rocky  but rocky was fiction  and so is the idea that someone can fight for working people and at the same time  embrace the broken system washington  where corporate lobbyists use their clout to shape laws to their liking  we need to challenge the system on behalf of america's workers  and if we're not willing to take up that fight  then real change   change that will make a lasting difference in the lives of ordinary americans   will keep getting blocked by the defenders of the status quo  i believe i can bring about that kind of change   because i'm the only candidate in this race who's actually worked to take power away from lobbyists by passing historic ethics reforms in illinois and in the u s  senate  and i'm the only candidate who isn't taking a dime from washington lobbyists  they have not funded my campaign  they will not run my administration  and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i'm president of the united states  your voices will be heard  this isn't just campaign talk  i've been fighting for working families ever since i moved to chicago more than two decades ago to work as a community organizer  giving job training to the jobless and hope to the hopeless when the local steel plants closed  and the reason i'm standing here today is because i don't want to wake up one morning many years from now and see that nothing has changed because the system is still being rigged against america's families  and i know you don't either  because despite seven years of the most anti labor administration in generations   as i look out on this crowd and as i travel across this country  the one thing i know for certain is that labor unions are still mobilizing  labor unions are still organizing  and you're still fighting to give america's working people a voice in washington  i'm tired of playing defense  i know the afl cio is tired of playing defense  we're ready to play some offense  we're ready to play offense for a decent wage  we're ready to play offense for retirement security  we're ready to play offense for universal health care  it's time to stand up to the big drug and insurance companies that have been blocking reform and say enough is enough   we're going to finally make health care affordable and available for every american  we're going to finally help folks like the young woman i met who works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't afford medicine for a sister who's ill  no american should be driven into bankruptcy trying to pay their medical bills  no worker should have to go without a pay raise because their employer has to use the money to cover the rising cost of health care  that's why we'll pass universal health care by the end of my first term as president and save the typical family up to   a year on their premiums  in this country of all countries  health care shouldn't be a privilege for the few  it should be a fundamental right for every american  we're ready to play offense for organized labor  it's time we had a president who didn't choke saying the word  union  a president who knows it's the department of labor and not the department of management  and a president who strengthens our unions by letting them do what they do best   organize our workers  if a majority of workers want a union  they should get a union  it's that simple  let's stand up to the business lobby that's been getting their friends in washington to block card check  i've fought to pass the employee free choice act in the senate  and i will make it the law of the land when i'm president of the united states of america  we're ready to play offense for working families  i'm the only candidate in this race who's called for a middle class tax cut that will save families up to   a year  including over   million people in this state  and i've also called for eliminating income taxes entirely for seniors making under   a year  and we also have to do more to make sure folks who are getting laid off in these hard times still have enough money to make ends meet  which is why i'm working with my friend senator bob casey to extend unemployment insurance  and make it available for working folks who aren't in a union and don't work a regular  to  job  but we also have to do more over the long term to invest in our middle class  and that's what we'll do as president  to ensure that our children have the skills to compete in our global economy  we'll make college affordable with a   tax credit for anyone who's willing to do some community service  and we'll pass the patriot employer act that i've been fighting for ever since i ran for the senate   so we can end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas  and give them to companies that create good jobs with decent wages right here in america  i've also proposed creating millions of new jobs and doing it in a way that's fiscally responsible  i've called for investing   billion over the next ten years to rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges  and this will generate millions of new jobs  many of them in the construction industry that's been hard hit by our housing crisis  i also believe it's time washington started showing the same kind of leadership that pennsylvania's labor movement has shown by fighting to create the green jobs that are the jobs of the future  that's why i'll invest   billion over the next decade to establish a green energy sector that will create up to   million new jobs   and those are jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  and thanks to leaders like my friend congressman patrick murphy  these kinds of jobs are bringing new life back to places that have been hard hit in recent decades   places like fairless hills in bucks county  where the old u s  steel plant is now being used to help produce wind power  now  if we're honest with ourselves  we'll acknowledge that we can't stop globalization in its tracks and that opening new markets to our goods can help strengthen our economy  but what i refuse to accept is that we have to sign trade deals like the south korea agreement that are bad for american workers  what i oppose   and what i have always opposed   are trade deals that put the interests of multinational corporations ahead of the interests of americans workers   like nafta  and cafta  and permanent normal trade relations with china  and i'll also oppose the colombia free trade agreement if president bush insists on sending it to congress because the violence against unions in colombia would make a mockery of the very labor protections that we have insisted be included in these kinds of agreements  so you can trust me when i say that whatever trade deals we negotiate when i'm president will be good for american workers  and that they'll have strong labor and environmental protections that we'll enforce  these are the battles we should be fighting  this is the future we should be building  but it's going to be hard to do all this so long as we're spending   billion a month fighting a war in iraq that should have never been authorized and never been waged  i opposed this war from the start  i've opposed it each year it's been going on  and that's why i'm the one candidate who will offer a real choice in november because i can stand up to john mccain with credibility and say no to a  year occupation of iraq  and no to a third bush term  it's time to bring out troops home  it's time to end the fight in iraq and take up the fight for good jobs and universal health care  it's time to end the fight in iraq and take up the fight for a world class education and social security  it's time to end the fight in iraq and take up the fight for opportunity and prosperity here at home  so make no mistake   the american people have a choice in this election  we can keep playing the same washington game with the same washington players  and somehow expect a different result  or we can choose a different future  just imagine it  imagine a president whose life's story is like so many of your own  who knows what it's like to go to college on student loans  and see his mother get sick and worry that maybe she can't pay the medical bills  imagine a washington where the only lobby that has real influence is the people's lobby  a washington where you can trust that your voice will be heard before any major piece of labor legislation is signed into law  imagine an america that lives up to the idea that those mechanics proposed nearly two hundred years ago  where we finally have a system that works for main street and not just wall street  that's the change we seek  that's the vision the afl cio has always fought for  and that's the future that's within our grasp  so i'm asking you to march with me  and work with me  and fight with me  and if you do  then i truly believe we won't just win this primary  and we won't just defeat john mccain in november   we'll build an america where labor is on the rise  where hope is on the rise  and where the american dream is within reach for every family in this country  thank you "], ["obama1", "as mike said  today represents a tragic anniversary for our country  through his faith  courage  and wisdom  dr  martin luther king jr  moved an entire nation  he preached the gospel of brotherhood  of equality and justice  that's the cause for which he lived   and for which he died forty years ago today  and so before we begin  i ask you to join me in a moment of silence in memory of this extraordinary american  there's been a lot of discussion this week about how dr  king's life and legacy speak to us today  it's taking place in our schools and churches  on television and around the dinner table  and i suspect that much of what folks are talking about centers on issues of racial justice   on the montgomery bus boycott and the march on washington  on the freedom rides and the stand at selma  and that's as it should be   because those were times when ordinary men and women  straight backed and clear eyed  challenged what they knew was wrong and helped perfect our union  and they did so in large part because dr  king pointed the way  but i also think it's worth reflecting on what dr  king was doing in memphis  when he stepped onto that motel balcony on his way out for dinner  and what he was doing was standing up for struggling sanitation workers  for years  these workers had served their city without complaint  picking up other people's trash for little pay and even less respect  passers by would call them  walking buzzards  and in the segregated south  most were forced to use separate drinking fountains and bathrooms  but in   these workers decided they'd had enough  and over   went on strike  their demands were modest   better wages  better benefits  and recognition of their union  but the opposition was fierce  their vigils were met with handcuffs  their protests turned back with mace  and at the end of one march  a  year old boy lay dead  this is the struggle that brought dr  king to memphis  it was a struggle for economic justice  for the opportunity that should be available to people of all races and all walks of life  because dr  king understood that the struggle for economic justice and the struggle for racial justice were really one   that each was part of a larger struggle  for freedom  for dignity  and for humanity  so long as americans were trapped in poverty  so long as they were being denied the wages  benefits  and fair treatment they deserved   so long as opportunity was being opened to some but not all   the dream that he spoke of would remain out of reach  and on the eve of his death  dr  king gave a sermon in memphis about what the movement there meant to him and to america  and in tones that would prove eerily prophetic  dr  king said that despite the threats he'd received  he didn't fear any man  because he had been there when birmingham aroused the conscience of this nation  and he'd been there to see the students stand up for freedom by sitting in at lunch counters  and he'd been there in memphis when it was dark enough to see the stars  to see the community coming together around a common purpose  so dr  king had been to the mountaintop  he had seen the promised land  and while he knew somewhere deep in his bones that he would not get there with us  he knew that we would get there  he knew it because he had seen that americans have  the capacity  as he said that night   to project the 'i' into the 'thou '  to recognize that no matter what the color of our skin  no matter what faith we practice  no matter how much money we have   no matter whether we are sanitation workers or united states senators   we all have a stake in one another  we are our brother's keeper  we are our sister's keeper  and  either we go up together  or we go down together  and when he was killed the following day  it left a wound on the soul of our nation that has yet to fully heal  and in few places was the pain more pronounced than in indianapolis  where robert kennedy happened to be campaigning  and it fell to him to inform a crowded park that dr  king had been killed  and as the shock turned toward anger  kennedy reminded them of dr  king's compassion  and his love  and on a night when cities across the nation were alight with violence  all was quiet in indianapolis  in the dark days after dr  king's death  coretta scott king pointed out the stars  she took up her husband's cause and led a march in memphis  but while those sanitation workers eventually got their union contract  the struggle for economic justice remains an unfinished part of the king legacy  because the dream is still out of reach for too many americans  just this morning  it was announced that more americans are unemployed now than at any time in years  and all across this country  families are facing rising costs  stagnant wages  and the terrible burden of losing a home  part of the problem is that for a long time  we've had a politics that's been too small for the scale of the challenges we face  this is something i spoke about a few weeks ago in a speech i gave in philadelphia  and what i said was that instead of having a politics that lives up to dr  king's call for unity  we've had a politics that's used race to drive us apart  when all this does is feed the forces of division and distraction  and stop us from solving our problems  that is why the great need of this hour is much the same as it was when dr  king delivered his sermon in memphis  we have to recognize that while we each have a different past  we all share the same hopes for the future   that we'll be able to find a job that pays a decent wage  that there will be affordable health care when we get sick  that we'll be able to send our kids to college  and that after a lifetime of hard work  we'll be able to retire with security  they're common hopes  modest dreams  and they're at the heart of the struggle for freedom  dignity  and humanity that dr  king began  and that it is our task to complete  you know  dr  king once said that the arc of the moral universe is long  but that it bends toward justice  but what he also knew was that it doesn't bend on its own  it bends because each of us puts our hands on that arc and bends it in the direction of justice  so on this day   of all days   let's each do our part to bend that arc  let's bend that arc toward justice  let's bend that arc toward opportunity  let's bend that arc toward prosperity for all  and if we can do that and march together   as one nation  and one people   then we won't just be keeping faith with what dr  king lived and died for  we'll be making real the words of amos that he invoked so often  and  let justice roll down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream "], ["obama1", "before we get started today  i just want to say a few words about the troubling economic situation we've got in this country  this is the number one issue on lots of people's minds these days  and we all know why   because the cost of everything from health care  to a tank of gas  to college tuition has gone up while wages have stayed the same  millions of americans are facing foreclosure  and millions more are unemployed  and yet  we also know that times haven't been too tough for everyone in our economy   because the top wall street ceos have been doing just fine  in this morning's usa today  there was a story about how much the top ceos have been making  they did a study and found that the top   ceos made somewhere around   million last year   despite the fact that many of their companies were having a bad year  think about that  it doesn't matter whether they're doing a good job or not   wall street executives are being rewarded either way  that's not the america we believe in  that's an outrage  but it's not an accident  it's a consequence of a tired and cynical philosophy that has failed the american people  it's a philosophy that says unless you're a big campaign donor or a special interest lobbyist   you're on your own  and it's a philosophy that's come to dominate washington over the last seven and a half years  under george bush  we've seen tax cuts for the wealthiest americans who don't need them and didn't ask for them  we've been giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas when we should be giving them to companies that create good jobs here at home  we've been extending a hand to wall street  but not lifting a finger for main street  and we wonder why polls show folks are more downbeat about their futures than they've been in nearly fifty years  now  i respect john mccain  he'll be a worthy opponent  but he's been a staunch supporter of washington's failed policies  and in this election he will offer more of the same policies that have set back working people  i admired senator mccain when he stood up and said that the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans offended his  conscience  but he got over that  and now he's all for them  and for continuing to do the same things that have taken us toward recession  just look at the speech he's giving today about our economy  senator mccain is making some proposals about how to deal with our housing crisis  and i'm glad he's finally decided to offer a plan  better late than never  but don't expect any real answers  don't expect it to actually help struggling families  because senator mccain's solution to the housing crisis seems a lot like the george bush solution of sitting by and hoping it passes while families face foreclosure and watch the value of their homes erode  the american people can't afford this kind of do nothing approach  they need help immediately  now  congress took some steps several weeks ago to stimulate our economy   and many of these steps were ones i was calling for back in january  but our economy keeps getting worse  just last week  we learned that we've lost   jobs this year   and   jobs were lost in march alone  that's why i'm calling for a second stimulus package to help hardworking families and strengthen our middle class  first  we need to get immediate relief to the unemployed who need help most  if you've lost your job during this current economic downturn  you're nearly twice as likely to stay unemployed for six months or longer as you were at the start of the last recession in   it's especially hard to find a job for older workers who don't have the skills to compete in our  st century economy  so we need to significantly extend unemployment insurance and expand it to include folks who are currently left out  that way  we can help them make ends meet while they're out of work  and make sure they're still spending money so we can keep the wheels of our economy turning  second  we need to address the crisis in the housing market   because we know that the housing crisis is the source of many of the other economic problems we're facing today  that's why i've called for the immediate creation of a   billion foreclosure prevention fund  this fund would help struggling homeowners sell a home that's beyond their means  or get emergency pre foreclosure counseling so they can make informed decisions  or modify their loans to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy  finally  i've also proposed   billion in relief for state and local governments in those areas that are being hardest hit by our housing crisis and struggling economy   because we need to make sure that they have enough money to provide critical services like health care and housing  and don't have to cut back on providing help for our families in these difficult times  but understand  if we're serious about strengthening our economy  we've got to invest in long term job growth as well  now  back in the  's  americans were put to work building the interstate highway system and that helped expand the middle class in this country  we need to show the same kind of leadership today  that's why i've called for a national infrastructure reinvestment bank that will invest   billion over ten years and generate nearly two million new jobs   many of them in the construction industry that's suffered during this housing crisis  and i've also proposed investing   billion in our green energy sector over the next ten years  this won't just help reduce our dependence on foreign oil  and it won't just help save this planet for our children  it will also create up to five million new jobs   and those are jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  this is the kind of help americans need  and this is the kind of help washington has to provide  it's time to end the bush mccain approach that tells the american people   'you're on your own'   because we know we're all in this together as americans  that's what brought you here today  and that's the idea we'll restore in the white house when i'm president of the united states "], ["obama1", "i'd like to say a few words this morning about the state of our economy  you know  we talk about  issues  in a campaign  but for families across indiana and the country  the economy is more than a discussion point  that's because the cost of everything from health care  to a tank of gas  to college tuition has shot up while wages have stayed the same  so families are feeling the pinch  on top of that  millions of americans are also facing foreclosure or seeing the value of their homes decline  and millions more are out of work  so i wasn't particularly surprised when i read the other day about a poll that shows folks are now more downbeat about their futures than they've been in nearly fifty years  but we also know that's only half the story   because wall street executives have been doing just fine  some ceos make more in one day than their workers make in one year  there was a story about this in the paper the other day  they did a study and found that the top   ceos made around   million last year   despite the fact that many of their companies have been falling behind  we all believe in that fundamental  american value that if you do good work  if you're successful  you should be rewarded  but if you're a wall street ceo today  it doesn't seem to matter whether you're doing a good job or a bad job for your shareholders and workers  you'll be rewarded either way  take the home building company  kb home  they lost nearly   billion last year  but their ceo walked away with a   million cash bonus  and that's on top of his   million base salary  and just the other week  we learned that when countrywide financial was sold a few months ago  its top two executives got a combined   million  nevermind that countrywide is as responsible as anyone for the scandalous mortgage crisis we've got today   a crisis that's the source of many of our other economic problems  this is an outrage  but as i said in a recent speech at the cooper union in new york city  this isn't an accident  it's because of decisions made  not just in boardrooms or trading floors  but in washington  under republican and democratic administrations  we failed to guard against practices that all too often rewarded financial manipulation instead of productivity and sound business practices  we let the special interests put their thumbs on the economic scales  using their clout to rig the game against everyday americans  so what we need to do is restore balance to our economy and put in place rules of the road to make competition fair  and open  and honest  one place we can start is by restoring common sense to executive pay  that's why last year  i proposed legislation that would give shareholders a say on what ceos are getting paid  and help ensure that companies are disclosing the rationale for the salary and benefits that ceos are getting  this isn't just about expressing outrage  it's about changing a system where bad behavior is rewarded   so that we can hold ceos accountable  and make sure they're acting in a way that's good for their company  good for our economy  and good for america  not just good for themselves  we've seen what happens when ceos are paid for doing a job no matter how bad a job they're doing  we can't afford to postpone reform any longer  that's why washington needs to act immediately to pass this legislation  now  i know senator mccain had some sharp words the other day about what some ceos are getting paid  and i was glad to hear it  but when he's had the chance to do something about this problem  he's opted for continuing the do nothing approach of the bush years  and this seems to be a trend with senator mccain  yesterday  he finally proposed some steps to deal with our housing crisis  and i'm glad he's moving in the right direction  but what he's proposing isn't enough to really help struggling families  so i respect john mccain  he'll be a worthy opponent  but we can't afford another four years of policies that don't make a difference in the lives of ordinary americans  and that's what john mccain is offering  we need a president who understands the fundamental truth that's been at the heart of america's economic success   that each american does better when all americans do better  that the well being of american business and the american people are aligned  that's the kind of leadership the american people deserve  and that's the kind of leadership i intend to offer as president "], ["obama1", " b campbell brown  moderator br jon meacham  moderator b b brown b  welcome back  everybody  to the compassion forum  and senator obama is joining us now  thanks for being with us   b obama b  thank you so much for having me   b brown b  so i'm going to start with something that's been in the news  i don't have to tell you that you made some comments recently that are generating a lot of controversy  and i want to remind the audience and our viewers of what you had said  you were talking about people here in small towns in pennsylvania suffering economic hardship  and you said  quote  it's not surprising they get bitter  they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them  and to a lot of the religious leaders in this room  to a lot of decent  hardworking people out there  it may have come across as you attacking their values or their religion  suggesting that people are clinging to religion   b obama b  well  first of all  you know  scripture talks about clinging to what's good  and so it's very important   my words may have been clumsy  which happens surprisingly often on a presidential campaign laughter    but this is something that i've talked about before  i've talked about in my own life  which is that religion is a bulwark  a foundation when other things aren't going well  that's true in my own life  through trials and tribulations  and so what i was referring to was in no way demeaning a faith that i  myself  embrace  what i was saying is that when economic hardship hits in these communities  what people have is they've got family  they've got their faith  they've got the traditions that have been passed onto them from generation to generation  those aren't bad things  that's what they have left  and  unfortunately  what people have become bitter about   and oftentimes have told me about  as i traveled through not just pennsylvania  but i was referring to states all across the midwest  including my home state   is any confidence that the government is listening to them  they don't think that government is listening to them  so i think it is very important to understand   and i think it's unfortunate that  in the political process  presidential campaigns  that people have been trying to misconstrue my words   to understand that  you know  i am a devout christian  that i started my work working with churches in the shadow of steel plants that had closed on the south side of chicago  that nobody in a presidential campaign on the democratic side in recent memory has done more to reach out to the church and talk about  what are our obligations religiously  in terms of doing good works  and how does that inform our politics  so i think that this is an example of  frankly  how the political debate can distract us from what is really at issue and that is  how are we going to create a just and fair society where people are getting a fair shake  and that's why i'm running this campaign   b brown b  and hillary clinton  who was just here  said you're being elitist   b obama b  well  that is  i think  a good example of what happens on the presidential campaign  is that we try to tear each other down instead of lifting the country up   b obama b  but  you know  the notion that somebody like myself  who has been working in churches since i got out of college  and whose entire trajectory  not just during this campaign  but long before  has been to talk about how democrats need to get in church  reach out to evangelicals  link faith with the work that we do  the notion that somehow i am standing above that when that essentially describes much of what i've been doing over the last   years doesn't make much sense   b meacham b  senator  do you believe that god intervenes in history and rewards or punishes people or nations in real time for their behavior   b obama b  you know  what i believe is that god intervenes  but that his plans are a little too mysterious for me to grasp  and so what i try to do is  as best i can  be an instrument of his will  to act in what i think is accordance to the precepts of my faith  and  you know  if i'm acting in an ethical way  if i am working to make sure that i am applying what i consider to be a core value of christianity  but also a core value of all great religions  and that is that i am my brother's keeper and i am my sister's keeper  then i will be doing my part to move his agenda forward  i don't know what that master plan is  and i don't presume to know  and i think that none of us know  but what we do   what i think we can do is to act in ways that are consummate with the values that we cherish  and sometimes that's harder to do in politics than it should be  but i think that's what's demanded of us   b brown b  let's take a question from reverend samuel rodriguez  who is with us  he is president of the national hispanic christian leadership conference  reverend   strong rev  samuel rodriguez  president  national hispanic leadership conference strong  senator obama  the vast majority of americans believe that abortion is a decision to be made by a woman  her family and her doctors  however  the vast majority of americans similarly believe that abortion is the taking of a human life  the terms pro choice and pro life  do they encapsulate that reality in our  st century setting and can we find common ground   b obama b  i absolutely think we can find common ground  and it requires a couple of things  number one  it requires us to acknowledge that there is a moral dimension to abortion  which i think that all too often those of us who are pro choice have not talked about or tried to tamp down  i think that's a mistake because i think all of us understand that it is a wrenching choice for anybody to think about  the second thing  once we acknowledge that  is to recognize that people of good will can exist on both sides  that nobody wishes to be placed in a circumstance where they are even confronted with the choice of abortion  how we determine what's right at that moment  i think  people of good will can differ  and if we can acknowledge that much  then we can certainly agree on the fact that we should be doing everything we can to avoid unwanted pregnancies that might even lead somebody to consider having an abortion  and we've actually made progress over the last several years in reducing teen pregnancies  for example  and what i have consistently talked about is to take a comprehensive approach where we focus on abstinence  where we are teaching the sacredness of sexuality to our children  but we also recognize the importance of good medical care for women  that we're also recognizing the importance of age appropriate education to reduce risks  i do believe that contraception has to be part of that education process  and if we do those things  then i think that we can reduce abortions and i think we should make sure that adoption is an option for people out there  if we put all of those things in place  then i think we will take some of the edge off the debate  we're not going to completely resolve it  i mean  there   you know  at some point  there may just be an irreconcilable difference  and those who are opposed to abortion  i think  should continue to be able to lawfully object and try to change the laws   b obama b  those of us  like myself  who believe that in this difficult situation it is a woman's responsibility and choice to make in consultation with her doctor and her pastor and her family  i think we will continue to suggest that that's the right legal framework to deal with the issue  but at least we can start focusing on how to move in a better direction than the one we've been in the past   b meacham b  senator  do you personally believe that life begins at conception  and if not  when does it begin   b obama b  this is something that i have not  i think  come to a firm resolution on  i think it's very hard to know what that means  when life begins  is it when a cell separates  is it when the soul stirs  so i don't presume to know the answer to that question  what i know  as i've said before  is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when we're having these debates   b brown b  let me go to  again  are the end of the spectrum on that  there are a lot of philosophical and ethical questions relating to ending one's life  in  the audacity of hope  you write very movingly about your mother's fight with cancer  the pain she was in and the process that she went through  especially toward the end  in that vein  if someone today was in her position  and wanted to take active steps to end his or her own life  do you think that would be ok morally   b obama b  well i think we have to be very careful in making end of life decisions  i believe in first of all everybody having a living will so that their views on these issues can be factored in by family members and their doctors and many of the difficult choices that are made are made because people don't have guidance from the individual  i do believe in the importance of medicine and that if somebody is terminally ill  relieving their pain and suffering is the right thing to do  what happens then is you start getting into a gray area where relieving pain and suffering may accelerate death in some situations and that's a decision that should be made by the individual  the family and the doctor  i don't think that it's appropriate to empower doctors themselves to make that decision  but i think that it is important for us to be able to allow people who are terminally ill  in excruciating pain  to get the medicine they need to relieve that pain   b brown b  by relieve that pain you mean hasten the end of life if they choose to   b obama b  and i think that there has to be very strict guidelines to ensure that somebody who is making a decision to relieve their pain that might take a week away from their life just because they are   they are slipping into a coma quicker  for example  that that is distinguished from   or at least there's a possibility that they slip into a coma  that that's distinguished from euthanasia in which someone else is making the decision for them   b brown b  let's go to dr  frank page  who's with us  president of the southern baptist convention  dr  page   strong frank page  southern baptist convention strong  thank you  senator obama  thank you for being here at messiah college for the compassion forum  southern baptists have been very active for years in sub  saharan africa in the hiv aids relief ministries  sometimes orphan care  sometimes educational activities  but we also are involved in a ministry called true love waits  which has been credited by the government of uganda from lowering the aids infection rate there dramatically from   percent to   percent  but we also teach a part of that  that faith has a role in the issue of hiv aids  do you concur with that and would you elaborate on that please   b brown b  can i just clarify  true love waits is an abstinence program   strong page strong  abstinence based and faith based  yes   b obama b  well  first of all  congratulations to those who have been involved in that work  i think it's important work  and i think you may know my father came from this part of the world  i visited kenya multiple times  i have been working with a group of grandmas who were helping aids orphans in kenya   b obama b  michelle and i  when we were traveling there  took an aids test before thousands of people to encourage the importance of them getting clear on what their status was and hopefully reducing infections  and  by the way  this is an area where   this doesn't happen very often  so everybody should take note   where i compliment george bush  i actually think that   applause  i actually think that the pepfar program is one of the success stories of this administration  we've seen a drastic increase in funding  and terrific work is being done between the cdc  the nih  local aids organizations  ngos  my view is  is that we should use whatever the best approaches are  the scientifically sound approaches are  to reduce this devastating disease all across the world  and part of that  i think  should be a strong education component and i think abstinence education is important  i also think that contraception is important  i also think that treatment is important  i also think that we have to do more to make antiviral drugs available to people who are in extreme poverty  so i don't want to pluck out one facet of it  now  that doesn't mean that non for profit groups can't focus on one thing while the government focuses on other things  i think we want to have a comprehensive approach  i do think that   and i've said this when i was in kenya   that there is a behavioral element to aids that has to be addressed  and if there is   if there's promiscuity and we are pretending that that's not an issue in spreading aids  then we're missing part of the answer  but i also think that   keep in mind  women are far more likely to be infected now between the ages of   and   than are men  and that's why focusing  for example  on the status of women  empowering women  giving them microbicides  or other strategies that would allow them to protect themselves when they sometimes in certain situations may not be able to protect themselves from having unprotected sex  all those things are going to be just as important  as well   b meacham b  sir  in an earlier occasion in   applause    an earlier occasion in talking about your own daughters and talking about sex education and contraception  you said that you would not want your daughter punished with a baby if she made a mistake  that you would teach values and morals  but if something were to happen  the phrase punished with a baby was jarring to a number of people  could you explain what you meant by that   b obama b  well  keep in mind  on that same day  i said children are miracles  and so i think it's important not to parse my words too carefully here  what i was saying was that my daughters are   and    laughter  and so if  at the age of   or   they made what i would consider to be a mistake  in having sex or unprotected sex  and ended up getting pregnant   i think that statistically we know   or   year olds who are having children are much more likely to be impoverished  are much more likely to have health problems  are much more likely to have trouble raising that child  and so all i meant was we want to prevent teen pregnancies  and what we don't want to do is to be blind to the possibility that kids will screw up  just like  surprisingly enough  we as adults screw up sometimes  and  you know  we should factor in the possibility that they make mistakes in our approach to dealing with stds  which is what i was being asked about at the time  and we want to make sure that  even as we are teaching responsible sexuality and we are teaching abstinence to children  that we are also making sure that they've got  you know  enough understanding about contraception that they don't end up having much more severe problems because of a dumb mistake   b brown b  senator  if one of your daughters asked you   and maybe they already have   daddy  did god really create the world in six days  what would you say   b obama b  you know  i'm trying to remember if we had this conversation   laughter   b obama b  you know  what i've said to them is that i believe that god created the universe and that the six days in the bible may not be six days as we understand it  it may not be  hour days  and that's what i believe  i know there's always a debate between those who read the bible literally and those who don't  and  you know  that  i think  is a legitimate debate within the christian community of which i am a part  you know  my belief is  is that the story that the bible tells about god creating this magnificent earth on which we live  that that is   that is essentially true  that is fundamentally true  now whether it happened exactly as we might understand it reading the text of the bible  that  you know  i don't presume to know   b brown b  let's go to   b obama b  but let me just make one last point on this  i do believe in evolution  i don't think that is incompatible with christian faith  just as i don't think science generally is incompatible with christian faith  and i think that this is something that  you know  we get bogged down in  there are those who suggest that if you have a scientific bent of mind  then somehow you should reject religion  and i fundamentally disagree with that  in fact  the more i learn about the world  the more i know about science  the more i'm amazed about the mystery of this planet and this universe  and it strengthens my faith as opposed to weakens it   applause   b brown b  let's go to reverend richard cizik  who is vice president of the national association of evangelicals  reverend   strong rev  richard cizik  vice president  national association of evangelicals strong  good evening  senator  you just took my question  congratulations  you won the prize  no  let me flesh this out just a little bit  if you wouldn't mind   b obama b  sure   strong cizik strong  frankly  there has been perceived  by many  millions  a war between science and faith  i don't believe there's a war at all  in fact  the worlds of religion and science are coming together in amazing ways  including here on this campus  for example  you have young evangelical christians who are leaders on developing what we call creation care or a policy on climate change  and so let me ask you  you have already hinted at it  but let me ask you in specific  how do you relate your faith or personal convictions to science generally and science policy  and let's take an issue like climate and flesh that out  or take stem cells  something like that  just give us a little more indication of how you think   b obama b  well  first of all   strong cizik strong  is that fair enough   b obama b  it is fair enough  and you guys have done some terrific work on this  so i want to congratulate you on that   applause   b obama b  and should it be part of god's plan to have me in the white house  i look forward to our collaboration   laughter   applause   b obama b  so  look  the   one of the things i draw from the genesis story is the importance of us being good stewards of the land  of this incredible gift  and i think there have been times where we haven't been and this is one of those times where we've got to take the warning seriously  i know that al gore was mentioned earlier  by the way  i have to say  i think al gore won  and   applause   b obama b  and has done terrific work since  but i think that we are seeing enough warning signs for us to take this seriously  and part of what my religious faith teaches me is to take an intergenerational view  to recognize that we are borrowing this planet from our children and our grandchildren  and so we've got this obligation to them  which means that we've got to make some uncomfortable choices  and where i think potentially religious faith and the science of global warming converge is precisely because it's going to be hard to deal with  we have to find resources in ourselves that allow us to make those sacrifices where we say  you know what  we're not going to leave it to the next generation  we're not going to wait   b obama b  we are going to put in place a cap and trade system that controls the amount of greenhouse gases that are going into the atmosphere  and we know that that requires us to make adjustments in terms of how we use energy  we've got to be less wasteful  both as a society and in our own individual lives  and having faith  believing that this planet and this world extends beyond us  it's not just here for us  but it's here for  you know  more generations to come  i think religion can actually bolster our desire to make those sacrifices now  and that's why  as president  i hope to be able to rally the entire world around the importance of us being good stewards of the land   b brown b  all right  senator obama  we're going to take a quick break  everybody stay with us  we'll be right back  when we come back  we'll ask senator obama what he will tell those americans who say there's too much religion in government   commercial break   b brown b  welcome back  everybody  to messiah college in grantham  pennsylvania  we're talking to the democratic candidates about how the role of faith and compassion would play in their presidency  senator barack obama is with us now  jon   b meacham b  you have spoken about how your former pastor in chicago  the rev  jeremiah wright  was critical in helping bring you to christianity and is like part of your family  can you tell us how he helped bring you closer to god   b obama b  well  i actually wrote about this in my second book   audacity of hope  i had worked as an organizer on the south side  as i mentioned and it was tough work   b obama b  you know  the community was in difficult straits  and i was bringing churches together to set up job training programs and after school programs for youth and to try to bring economic development to the community  i had been raised in a nonreligious home  my mother was the most spiritual person i know  but was mistrustful of organized religion  in part because of some of her experiences seeing segregation being compatible with organized religion  and so we went to church very infrequently  so as i'm doing this organizing  some of the pastors started saying  you know  you've got great ideas  obama  but  you know  if you're going to organize churches  it might help if you were going to church   laughter  and i thought  well  that's not an unreasonable position  and so i started visiting some churches  trinity united church of christ was one of the churches that we were trying to get involved in the organization  i visited that church and found the ministries that they were doing on hiv aids  on prison ministries  there were a whole host of wonderful ministries that they were engaged in  and reverend wright's sermons spoke directly to the social gospel  the need to act and not just to sit in the pews  and so i found that very attractive and ended up joining the church when i got out of law school  now  i have to say that  you know  in reports subsequently  there's been this notion that he was  by various terms  my spiritual adviser or my spiritual mentor  you know  he's been my pastor  and what that means is  is that  you know  the ministries that have been built in that church community have been very important to me  it also means that there are areas where we've disagreed on  and  obviously  the most recent loop that's been playing   reverend wright's greatest hits  so to speak   laughter    are  i think  both a distortion of who he is and what the church has been about  but also express   applause    but also express  you know  some comments that i think are deeply offensive and are contrary to what i believe  and i've told him so and have made a lot of statements about that  including one pretty long one in philadelphia  but that doesn't detract   applause  that  i think  doesn't detract from the incredible church community that this is  and i think that all of us who have been part of a faith community know that the church is a body of believers and it brings in the imperfections of us  men and women  and  you know  pastors are imperfect  certainly  the membership is imperfect  i  as somebody who is sitting in the pews as a sinner  is imperfect  and  you know  that doesn't detract from  i think  what the church is supposed to be about  which is to worship god and proclaim the good news   b brown b  senator  you are a christian  but as a child you had more exposure to islam than probably most americans ever will  how did that shape you   b obama b  well  i lived in indonesia for four and a half years when i was a child  and  actually  ironically  the first school i went to in indonesia was a catholic school  so  you know  myself and senator bob casey  who's sitting here  we had pretty similar experiences probably  in part  of at least our elementary school  i then attended a public school  but the majority of the country was muslim  and the brand of islam that was being practiced in indonesia at the time was a very tolerant islam  the country itself was explicitly secular in its constitution  and so you didn't have the oppressive state that was trying to impose people's religious beliefs  and christians and people of other faiths lived very comfortably there  and women were working  and out  and were not wearing the traditional coverings that we see in the middle east  and so what it taught me  and what it still teaches me  as i think about foreign policy now  is that islam can be compatible with the modern world   b obama b  it can be a partner with the christian and jewish and hindu and buddhist faiths in trying to create a better world  and so i am always careful and suspicious of attempts to paint islam with a broad brush because the overwhelming majority of the people of the islamic faith are people of good will who are trying to raise their families and live up to their values and ideals and to try to raise their kids as best they can and that's something that i think we always have to remember as opposed to assuming a clash of civilizations that sometimes are overheated rhetoric that politically is talked about   b brown b  let's go to reverend jim wallace  reverend wallace  he is president of sojourners  a christian social justice organization   strong rev  jim wallace  president  sojourners strong  hello  senator   b obama b  how are you  jim   b wallace b  i'm good  as you reminded us a week or two ago  when dr  martin luther king jr  was killed   years ago  he wasn't just speaking about civil rights  he was fighting for economic justice  was about to launch a poor people's campaign  yet  four decades after the anniversary of his death  the poverty rate in america is virtually unchanged and one in six of our children are poor in the richest nation in the world  so in the faith community  we are wanting a new commitment around a measurable goal  something like cutting poverty in half in   years  would you commit   would you at this historic compassion forum  commit to such a goal tonight and if elected  tell us how you'd mobilize the nation  mobilize us to achieve that goal   b obama b  well  first of all  jim  i appreciate the good work you've been doing on these issues  and i absolutely will make that commitment  understand that when i make that commitment  i do so with great humility because it is a very ambitious goal  and we're going to have to mobilize our society  not just to cut poverty  but to prevent more people from slipping into poverty  you know  this actually goes back to the earlier point you raised where senator clinton suggested i was being elitist when i said that people are frustrated and bitter  that is absolutely true  that's not just true in small towns  that's true in urban areas  that's true in my community of the south side of chicago  because people feel forgotten  they feel as if nobody is listening in washington  and that every four years we have politicians who come out and make promises and they are not kept  and so that's why i wanted to put the caveat on there  i make that commitment with humility because we've got a lot of work to do economically in this country to bring about a more just and fair economy  it starts with  i think  recognizing the rages and incomes for average families have gone down during the most recent economic expansion  that's never happened before in the history of america since we started recording these statistics  at least since world war ii  so we've got to shore up the mortgage market to make sure that we don't have millions of people who are losing their homes  we're going to have to  i think  change our tax code  for us to provide tax breaks to the wealthiest among us  those who didn't need them and weren't even asking for them  at a time when ordinary folks are struggling to fill up a gas tank just to get to a job  i met a guy here in pennsylvania when bob casey and i were traveling around who told me his problem was he's looking for a job and it costs him more than he can afford just to go to a job interview  and so we've got to give them some tax relief  and we've got to invest in our infrastructure to create jobs  particularly those who are going to be getting laid off in the construction industry  the housing market goes down  and i put forward very specific plans for that  we're going to have to  i think  invest heavily in clean energy  and if we have a cap in trade system  we can generate   billion over   years to invest in solar and wind and biodiesel and train people to build windmills and solar panels and make buildings more energy efficient   and make alternative fuels   applause   b obama b  all of these things   all of these things will strengthen the economy generally  and i left out one last point  health care  people are falling into bankruptcy  they are going without medical care  it is a moral imperative that we make sure that we have a plan in place that provides health care to every single american and that has high quality and provides prevention  if we do those things   and that applies not just to poor people but to working and middle class families all across the country  then we also have to focus on those who  even when the economy is good and the middle class are doing well  are still impoverished  and that's a special challenge  and that involves  i think  going at the problem at its roots very early  investing in early childhood education  working with at  risk parents   applause   b obama b    drastically improving our education system  k through   by paying our teachers more and demanding more from them   applause   b obama b  making sure that we have after school programs and summer school programs  and many of these  by the way  can be part of a faith community  and so  you know  just to go back to our theme here tonight  people sometimes ask me  what do i think about faith based initiatives  i want to keep the office of faith based initiatives open  but i want to make sure that its mission is clear  it's not to   it's not to simply build a particular faith community  the faith based initiatives should be targeted specifically at the issue of poverty and how to lift people up  and partnering with faith communities  i think we can achieve that as long as it's within the requirements of our constitution  we make sure that it's open to everybody  it's not simply the federal government funding certain groups to be able to evangelize   applause   b brown b  let's go to dr  david gushee  who is the president of evangelicals for human rights  dr  gushee   strong david p  gushee  mercer university   strong senator obama  recently yet another disturbing memo emerged from the justice department  this one said that not even interrogation methods that  quote  shock the conscience would be considered torture nor would they be considered illegal if they had been authorized by the president  senator obama  this kind of reasoning shocks the conscience of many millions of americans and many millions of people of faith here and around the world  is there justification for policies on the part of our nation that permit physical and mental cruelty toward those who are in our custody   b obama b  we have to be clear and unequivocal  we do not torture  period  we don't torture   applause   b obama b  our government does not torture  that should be our position  that should be our position  that will be my position as president  that includes  by the way  renditions  we don't farm out torture  we don't subcontract torture   applause   b obama b  and the reason this is important is not only because torture does not end up yielding good information   most intelligence officers agree with that  i met with a group   a distinguished group of former generals who have made it their mission to travel around and talk to presidential candidates and to talk in forums about how this degrades the discipline and the ethos of our military  it is very hard for us when kids  you know          are in iraq having to make difficult decisions  life or death decisions every day  and are being asked essentially to restrain themselves and operate within the law  and then to find out that our own government is not abiding by these same laws that we are asking them to defend  that is not acceptable  and so my position is going to be absolutely clear  and it is also important for our long term security to send a message to the world that we will lead not just with our military might but we are going to lead with our values and our ideals  that we are not a nation   applause   b obama b    that gives away our civil liberties simply because we're scared  and we're always at our worst when we're fearful  and one of the things that my religious faith allows me to do  hopefully  is not to operate out of fear  fear is a bad counsel and i want to operate out of hope and out of faith   applause   b brown b  we are almost out of time  i asked the same question to senator clinton  though  and it's that there are a lot of americans who believe the conversation going on here tonight is not necessarily appropriate  they believe that religion has far too much influence in public life  what do you say to that   b obama b  well  you know  what i've written in the past  what i've   i actually spoke at a sojourner's forum two years ago on this precise issue  and i think that we have fallen into a false debate  on the one hand  there have been elements  many of them in my own party  in the democratic party  that believe that any influence of religion whatsoever in the public debate somehow is problematic or violates church and state  on the other hand  there have been those primarily in the other party  in the republican party  whose view has been that the separation between church and state shouldn't even be there  and i think both extremes are wrong  what i believe is that all of us come to the public square with our own values and our ideals and our ethics  what we believe  and people of religious faith have the same right to come to that public square with values and ideals that are rooted in their faith  and they have the right to describe them in religious terms  which has been part of our history  as i said in some of my writings  imagine dr  king  you know  going up before  in front of the lincoln memorial and having to scrub all his religious references  or abraham lincoln in the second inaugural not being able to refer to god  what religious language can often do is allow us to get outside of ourselves and mobilize around a common good  on the other hand  what those of us of religious faith have to do when we're in the public square is to translate our language into a universal language that can appeal to everybody  and both lincoln and king did this and every great leader did it  because we are not just a christian nation  we are a jewish nation  we are a buddhist nation  we are a muslim nation  hindu nation  and we are a nation of atheists and nonbelievers  and it is important for us not to try to kill the debate by saying  well  god tells me i'm right  and so i'm not going to listen to you  rather  we've got to translate whatever it is that we believe into a language that allows for argument  allows for debate  and also allows that we may be wrong  and the biggest danger  i think  for those of us of religious faith when we're in the public sphere is a certain self righteousness  where we start thinking that  well  you know  i've got a direct line to god  you know  that is incompatible with democracy  you may have a direct line to god  but  you know  that is not   the public square is not the place for us to empower ourselves in tha tway   b brown b  many more questions  i'm sure  but we have to end it there  we're out of time  senator barack obama  thank you very much   applause   strong obama   strong thank you   b brown b  appreciate it  thank you   applause   b obama b  are you going to sign off  because i want to just say hi to some people   b brown b  please do  please do  we're going to sign off   b obama b  is that ok   b brown b  absolutely  i want to thank my co host  newsweek's jon meacham  as well as all those who joined us for tonight's forum  and also to the folks at faith in public life  the one campaign  and oxfam america  and  finally  a big thanks to our hosts here at messiah college  senator john mccain  we should mention  was not able to join us tonight  we look forward  though  to having him and the eventual democratic nominee for another compassion forum very soon  i'm campbell brown in grantham  pennsylvania  thanks for watching "], ["obama1", "being here in pennsylvania with the primary coming up  i know that politics is what's on a lot of people's minds  but as i look out at this crowd  i also know that being here isn't just about politics for me  it's personal  because it reminds me why i entered public service in the first place  as some of you might know  after college  i went to work as a community organizer for a group of churches on the south side of chicago  the job was to help lift communities that had been devastated when the local steel plants fell on hard times  thousands of folks had been laid off and some plants were closing down  and i can still remember the first time i saw a shuttered steel mill  it was late in the afternoon and i took a drive with another organizer over to the old wisconsin steel plant on the southeast side of chicago  some of you may know it  and as we drove up  i saw a sight that's probably familiar to some of you  i saw a plant that was empty and rusty  and behind a chain link fence  i saw weeds sprouting up through the concrete  and an old mangy cat running around  and i thought about all the good jobs it used to provide  and all the kids who used to work there in the summer to make some extra money for college  what i came to understand was that when a plant shuts down  it's not just the workers who pay a price  it's the whole community  i saw folks who felt like their government wasn't looking out for them and who had given up hope  so i worked with unions and the city government  and we brought the community together to fight for its common future  we gave job training to the jobless and hope to the hopeless  and block by block  we helped turn those neighborhoods around  more than twenty years later  as i've traveled across pennsylvania  and west virginia  and ohio  and all across this country  i'm still seeing too many places where plants have closed down and where folks are feeling like they're not getting a fair shot at life  like their dreams are slipping further out of reach  and that's partly because of the same kinds of global economic pressures that led steel plants in chicago to close down in the  s  but it's also because george bush has pursued policies that don't work for working americans  in recent years  we've seen more than   million high quality manufacturing jobs disappear  and more than   factories close down  and more often than not  the few jobs that are being created pay less than the ones we're losing and come without health insurance or a pension  which makes it even harder for families to feel secure about their future  but we also know this is a problem that goes beyond the failures of george bush   because for decades  through both democratic and republican administrations  we've seen the number of american owned steel companies dwindle down  for decades  our economic policies have been written to pump up a corporate bottom line  rather than promote what's right  without any consideration for the burden we all bear when workers are abused or the environment is destroyed  it's an outrage  but it's not an accident   because corporate lobbyists in washington are writing our laws and putting their clients' interests ahead of what's fair for the american people  the men and women you represent haven't been getting a seat at the table when trade agreements are being negotiated  or tax policies are being written  or health care and pension laws are being designed because the special interests have bought every chair  that's not the america i believe in  that's not the america you believe in  and that's why when i'm president  we'll make sure washington serves nobody's interests but the people's  you know  there's been a lot of talk in this campaign lately about who's  in touch  with the workers of pennsylvania  senator clinton and senator mccain are singing from the same hymn book  saying that i'm  out of touch    an  elitist    because i said a lot of folks are bitter about their economic circumstances  now it may be that i chose my words badly  it wasn't the first time and it won't be the last  but when i hear my opponents  both of whom have spent decades in washington  saying i'm out of touch  it's time to cut through their rhetoric and look at the reality  after all  you've heard this kind of rhetoric before  around election time  the candidates can't do enough for you  they'll  promise you anything  give you a long list of proposals and even come around  with tv crews in tow  to throw back a shot and a beer  but if those same candidates are taking millions of dollars in contributions from the pacs and lobbyists  ask yourself  who are they going to be toasting once the election is over  i'm the only candidate who doesn't take money from corporate pacs and lobbyists  and i'm here to tell you that you can count on me to stand up for you after this election  just as i've been standing up for workers all my life  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  senator clinton and senator mccain question my respect for the workers of pennsylvania  well  let me tell you how i believe you demonstrate your respect  you do it by telling the truth and keeping your word  so folks can know that where you stand today is where you'll stand tomorrow  the truth is  trade is here to stay  we live in a global economy  for america's future to be as bright as our past  we have to compete  we have to win  not every job that has left is coming back  and not every job lost is due to trade  automation has made plants more efficient so they can make the same amount of steel with few workers  these are the realities  i also don't oppose all trade deals  i voted for two of them because they have the worker and environmental agreements i believe in  some of you disagreed with me on this but i did what i thought was right  that's the truth  but let me tell you what else i believe in  for america to win  american workers have to win  too  if ceo pay keeps rising  while the standard of living for their workers continues to decline  that's not a win for america  that's why i opposed nafta  it's why i opposed cafta  and it's why i said any trade agreement i would support had to contain real  enforceable standards for workers  that's why i believe the permanent normalized trade agreement with china didn't do enough to ensure fairness and compliance  now  you can have a debate about whether my position is right or wrong  but here's what you can't do  you can't spend the better part of two decades campaigning for nafta and pntr for china  and then come here to pennsylvania  and tell the steelworkers you've been with them all along  you can't say you are opposed to the colombia trade deal  while your key strategist is working for the colombian government to get the deal passed  that's not respect  that's just more of the same old washington politics  and we can't afford more of the same  we need real change  and that's what i'm offering  i'm offering a new  more transparent and more inclusive path on trade so we can help promote an integrated global economy where the costs and benefits are distributed more equitably  and it starts with a principle i've always believed in   that trade should work for all americans  that's why we need to finally confront the issue of trade with china  as i've said before  america and the world can benefit from trade with china  but trade with china will only be good for you if china itself plays by the rules and acts as a positive force for balanced world growth  seeing the living standards of the chinese people improve is a good thing   good because we want a stable china  and good because china can be a powerful market for american exports  but too often  china has been competing in ways that are tilting the playing field  it's not just that china is following the path taken by so many other countries before it  and dumping goods into our market while not opening their own markets  something i've spoken out against  it's not just that they're violating intellectual property rights  they're also grossly undervaluing their currency  and giving their goods yet another unfair advantage  each year they've had the chance  the bush administration has failed to do anything about this  that's unacceptable  that's why i co sponsored the currency exchange rate oversight reform act  and that's why as president  i'll use all the diplomatic avenues open to me to insist that china stop manipulating its currency  we also have to make sure that whatever goods we're importing are safe for our families  we all saw the harm that was caused by lead toys from china that were reaching our store shelves  a few months ago  when i called for a ban on any toys that have more than a trace amount of lead  an official at china's foreign ministry said i was being  unobjective  unreasonable  and unfair  but i don't think protecting our children is  unreasonable    i think it's our obligation as parents and as americans  when it comes to trade  there's no one size fits all approach  if countries are committed to reciprocity  if they are abiding by basic rules of the road  then we should welcome trade  many poor countries need access to our markets and pose no threat to our workers  but what all trade agreements i negotiate as president will have in common is that they'll all put american workers first  we won't ignore violence against union organizers in colombia  or the non tariff barriers that keep u s  cars out of south korea  and we won't just negotiate fair trade agreements  we'll make sure they're being fully enforced  george bush has been far too slow to press american rights  that's an outrage  when our trading partners sign an agreement with the obama administration  you can trust that we'll hold them to it  now  if we're serious about standing up for american workers around the world  we also have to fight for you here at home  that means passing universal health care and making sure every american has insurance you can take with you even if you lose your job  and that a college degree is within reach  even if you're not rich   because all our children should have the skills to compete in the global economy  and it also means protecting the rights of our workers  it's time we had a president who didn't choke saying the word  union  we need to strengthen our unions by letting them do what they do best   organize our workers  if a majority of workers want a union  they should get a union  no matter whether they're full time  or part time  or contract workers  and that is why i will fight for and why i intend to sign the employee free choice act when it lands on my desk in the white house  here's what else i'll do  we'll pass the patriot employer act that i've been working on since i got to the senate   so we can stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  and start giving them to companies that create good jobs with decent wages here in america  and to those who think that the decline in american manufacturing is inevitable  or that manufacturing has no place in a  st century economy  we say right here and right now that the fight for manufacturing's future is the fight for america's future  and that's why we'll modernize our steel industry  strengthen our entire domestic manufacturing base  and open as many markets as we can to american manufactured goods when i'm president  we'll also make necessary long term investments in job growth  back in the  's  americans were put to work building the interstate highway system and that helped expand the middle class in this country  we need to show the same kind of leadership today  that's why i've called for a national infrastructure reinvestment bank that will invest   billion over ten years and generate millions of new jobs  we can't keep standing by while our roads and bridges and airports crumble and decay  we can't keep running our economy on debt  for our economy  our safety  and our workers  we have to rebuild america  and we need to invest in green technology  we can't keep sending billions of dollars to foreign nations because of our addiction to oil  we should be investing in american companies that invest in american manufactured solar panels and windmills  and in clean coal technology  that's why i've proposed investing   billion over the next ten years in the green energy sector  this will create up to five million new american jobs   and those are jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  that's a promise that we are making not just to this generation of americans  but to the next generation of americans  and that's why this will be a priority in my administration  now  i know some will say we can't afford all this  but let me just say this   if we can spend   billion a month rebuilding iraq  we can spend   billion a year in our own country to put americans back to work and strengthen the long term competitiveness of our economy  so make no mistake   the american people have a choice in this election  we can talk about our economic problems with trade all we want  but unless we change the broken system in washington  nothing else is going to change  we can talk all we want about respecting workers and their way of life  but unless we have a president you can trust to listen and put working americans first  nothing is really going to change  and you can trust me  because politics didn't lead me to working folks  working folks led me to politics  i was standing with american workers on the streets of chicago twenty years ago  and the reason i'm here today is because i don't want to wake up one day many years from now and see that our companies are still getting hurt because foreign governments are still bending or breaking the rules  or that we're still standing idly by while american jobs get shipped overseas  or that we still haven't made the investments in infrastructure and in training our workers that we desperately need  the reason i'm here today is because i know what it's like to go to college on student loans  and see a mother get sick and worry that maybe she can't pay the bills  i know what it's like to have to scratch and work and claw to build a better life for your family  and i don't want to wake up many years from now and find that the american dream is still out of reach for too many americans  the reason i'm here today is because i believe that if we can just put an end to the politics of division and distraction  and reclaim that sense that we all have a stake in each other  that we rise and fall as one nation  if we can just unite this country around a common purpose   black  white  hispanic  asian  and native american  labor and management  democrats  republicans  and independents   there's no obstacle we cannot overcome  no destiny we cannot fulfill  that's the fundamental truth i learned on the streets of chicago  that's the idea at the heart of your alliance for manufacturing  and that's the opportunity we have in this election  there is a moment in the life of every generation where that spirit of unity and hopefulness has to come through if we're going to make our mark on history  this is our moment  this is our time  and if you will march with me  and organize with me  if you vote for me  then i promise you this  we will not just win this democratic nomination  we will win the general election and then together   you and i   we're going to change this country  and we're going to change this world  thank you "], ["obama1", "good afternoon  i know i kept a lot of you guys busy this weekend with the comments i made last week  some of you might even be a little bitter about that  as i said yesterday  i regret some of the words i chose  partly because the way that these remarks have been interpreted have offended some people and partly because they have served as one more distraction from the critical debate that we must have in this election season  i'm a person of deep faith  and my religion has sustained me through a lot in my life  i even gave a speech on faith before i ever started running for president where i said that democrats   make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people's lives  i also represent a state with a large number of hunters and sportsmen  and i understand how important these traditions are to families in illinois and all across america  and  contrary to what my poor word choices may have implied or my opponents have suggested  i've never believed that these traditions or people's faith has anything to do with how much money they have  but i will never walk away from the larger point that i was trying to make  for the last several decades  people in small towns and cities and rural areas all across this country have seen globalization change the rules of the game on them  when i began my career as an organizer on the south side of chicago  i saw what happens when the local steel mill shuts its doors and moves overseas  you don't just lose the jobs in the mill  you start losing jobs and businesses throughout the community  the streets are emptier  the schools suffer  i saw it during my campaign for the senate in illinois when i'd talk to union guys who had worked at the local maytag plant for twenty  thirty years before being laid off at fifty five years old when it picked up and moved to mexico  and they had no idea what they're going to do without the paycheck or the pension that they counted on  one man didn't even know if he'd be able to afford the liver transplant his son needed now that his health care was gone  i've heard these stories almost every day during this campaign  whether it was in iowa or ohio or pennsylvania  and the people i've met have also told me that every year  in every election  politicians come to their towns  and they tell them what they want to hear  and they make big promises  and then they go back to washington when the campaign's over  and nothing changes  there's no plan to address the downside of globalization  we don't do anything about the skyrocketing cost of health care or college or those disappearing pensions  instead of fighting to replace jobs that aren't coming back  washington ends up fighting over the latest distraction of the week  and after years and years and years of this  a lot of people in this country have become cynical about what government can do to improve their lives  they are angry and frustrated with their leaders for not listening to them  for not fighting for them  for not always telling them the truth  and yes  they are bitter about that  now  senator mccain and the republicans in washington are already looking ahead to the fall and have decided that they plan on using these comments to argue that i'm out of touch with what's going on in the lives of working americans  i don't blame them for this   that's the nature of our political culture  and if i had to carry the banner for eight years of george bush's failures  i'd be looking for something else to talk about too  but i will say this  if john mccain wants to turn this election into a contest about which party is out of touch with the struggles and the hopes of working america  that's a debate i'm happy to have  in fact  i think that's a debate we need to have  because i believe that the real insult to the millions of hard working americans out there would be a continuation of the economic agenda that has dominated washington for far too long  i may have made a mistake last week in the words that i chose  but the other party has made a much more damaging mistake in the failed policies they've chosen and the bankrupt philosophy they've embraced for the last three decades  it's a philosophy that says there's no role for government in making the global economy work for working americas  that we have to just sit back watch those factories close and those jobs disappear  that there's nothing we can do or should do about workers without health care  or children in crumbling schools  or families who are losing their homes  and so we should just hand out a few tax breaks and wish everyone the best of luck  ronald reagan called this trickle down economics  george bush called it the ownership society  but what it really means is that you're on your own  if your premiums or your tuition is rising faster than you can afford  you're on your own  if you're that maytag worker who just lost his pension  tough luck  if you're a child born into poverty  you'll just have to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps  this philosophy isn't just out of touch   it's put our economy out of whack  years of pain on main street have finally trickled up to wall street and sent us hurtling toward recession  reminding us that we're all connected   that we can't prosper as a nation where a few people are doing well and everyone else is struggling  john mccain is an american hero and a worthy opponent  but he's proven time and time again that he just doesn't understand this  it took him three tries in seven days just to figure out that the home foreclosure crisis was an actual problem  he's had a front row seat to the last eight years of disastrous policies that have widened the income gap and saddled our children with debt  and now he's promising four more years of the very same thing  he's promising to make permanent the bush tax breaks for the wealthiest few who didn't need them and didn't ask for them   tax breaks that are so irresponsible that john mccain himself once said they offended his conscience  he's promising four more years of trade deals that don't have a single safeguard for american workers   that don't help american workers compete and win in a global economy  he's promising four more years of an administration that will push for the privatization of social security   a plan that would gamble away people's retirement on the stock market  a plan that was already rejected by democrats and republicans under george bush  he's promising four more years of policies that won't guarantee health insurance for working americans  that won't bring down the rising cost of college tuition  that won't do a thing for the americans who are living in those communities where the jobs have left and the factories have shut their doors  and yet  despite all this  the other side is still betting that the american people won't notice that john mccain is running for george bush's third term  they think that they'll forget about all that's happened in the last eight years  that they'll be tricked into believing that it's either me or our party is the one that's out of touch with what's going on in their lives  well i'm making a different bet  i'm betting on the american people  the men and women i've met in small towns and big cities across this country see this election as a defining moment in our history  they understand what's at stake here because they're living it every day  and they are tired of being distracted by fake controversies  they are fed up with politicians trying to divide us for their own political gain  and i believe they'll see through the tactics that are used every year  in every election  to appeal to our fears  or our biases  or our differences   because they've never wanted or needed change as badly as they do now  the people i've met during this campaign know that government cannot solve all of our problems  and they don't expect it to  they don't want our tax dollars wasted on programs that don't work or perks for special interests who don't work for us  they understand that we cannot stop every job from going overseas or build a wall around our economy  and they know that we shouldn't  but they believe it's finally time that we make health care affordable and available for every single american  that we bring down costs for workers and for businesses  that we cut premiums  and stop insurance companies from denying people care or coverage who need it most  they believe it's time we provided real relief to the victims of this housing crisis  that we help families refinance their mortgage so they can stay in their homes  that we start giving tax relief to the people who actually need it   middle class families  and seniors  and struggling homeowners  they believe that we can and should make the global economy work for working americans  that we might not be able to stop every job from going overseas  but we certainly can stop giving tax breaks to companies who send them their and start giving tax breaks to companies who create good jobs right here in america  we can invest in the types of renewable energy that won't just reduce our dependence on oil and save our planet  but create up to five million new jobs that can't be outsourced  they believe we can train our workers for those new jobs  and keep the most productive workforce the most competitive workforce in the world if we fix our public education system by investing in what works and finding out what doesn't  if we invest in early childhood education and finally make college affordable for everyone who wants to go  if we stop talking about how great our teachers are and start rewarding them for their greatness  they believe that if you work your entire life  you deserve to retire with dignity and respect  which means a pension you can count on  and social security that's always there  this is what the people i've met believe about the country they love  it doesn't matter if they're democrats or republicans  whether they're from the smallest towns or the biggest cities  whether they hunt or they don't  whether they go to church  or temple  or mosque  or not  we may come from different places and have different stories  but we share common hopes  and one very american dream  that is the dream i am running to help restore in this election  if i get the chance  that is what i'll be talking about from now until november  that is the choice that i'll offer the american people   four more years of what we had for the last eight  or fundamental change in washington  people may be bitter about their leaders and the state of our politics  but beneath that  they are hopeful about what's possible in america  that's why they leave their homes on their day off  or their jobs after a long day of work  and travel   sometimes for miles  sometimes in the bitter cold   to attend a rally or a town hall meeting held by senator clinton  or senator mccain  or myself  because they believe that we can change things  because they believe in that dream  i know something about that dream  i wasn't born into a lot of money  i was raised by a single mother with the help my grandparents  who grew up in small town kansas  went to school on the gi bill  and bought their home through an fha loan  my mother had to use food stamps at one point  but she still made sure that through scholarships  i got a chance to go to some of the best schools around  which helped me get into some of the best colleges around  which gave me loans that michelle and i just finished paying not all that many years ago  in other words  my story is a quintessentially american story  it's the same story that has made this country a beacon for the world a story of struggle and sacrifice on the part of my forebearers and a story overcoming great odds  i carry that story with me each and every day  it's why i wake up every day and do this  and it's why i continue to hold such hope for the future of a country where the dreams of its people have always been possible  thank you "], ["obama1", "we meet here at a challenging time for our families and a challenging time for america  all across the country  americans are anxious about their future  in a global economy with new rules and new risks  they've watched their government do its best to try and shift those risks onto the backs of the american worker  and they wonder how they will ever keep up  in coffee shops and town meetings  in vfw halls and right here in this room  the questions are all the same  will i be able to leave my children a better world than i was given  will i be able to save enough to send them to college or plan for a secure retirement  will my job even be there tomorrow  who will stand up for me in this new world  in this time of change and uncertainty  these questions are expected  but this isn't the first time we've heard them  these are the same kinds of questions i heard over two decades ago after i turned down a job on wall street and went to work as a community organizer on the south side of chicago  the job was to help lift up neighborhoods that had been devastated by the closing of local steel plants  so i worked with unions and the city government to organize job training for the jobless and hope for the hopeless  and block by block  we turned those neighborhoods around  it showed me the fundamental truth that's been at the heart of america's success   and at the heart of the labor movement in this country   the idea that we all have mutual obligations to one another  that i am my brother's keeper  i am my sister's keeper  and that in this country  we rise and fall together  but we know that for the past seven and a half years  we've had a whole different philosophy in the white house  they call it the ownership society   but what it means is you're on your own  you're a worker who's been laid off from a job  tough luck  you're on your own  you're a single mom trying to find health care for your kids  tough luck  you're on your own  you're a senior whose pension got dumped after a lifetime of hard work  tough luck  you're on your own  it's not just that this administration hasn't been fighting for you  they've actually tried to stop you from fighting for yourselves  this is the most anti labor administration in our memory  they don't believe in unions  they don't believe in organizing  they've packed the labor relations board with their corporate buddies  well  we've got news for them   it's not the department of management  it's the department of labor  and we're here to take it back  that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  now  john mccain seems to think the bush years have been pretty good because he's offering more of the same  and today's a good reminder of that because it's tax day  this is supposed to be a day when we pay what we owe to the government  but it's become a day when george bush's washington rewards its friends on wall street  john mccain used to oppose the bush tax cuts  he used to say that he couldn't support a tax cut where  so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate  he used to say that tax cuts in a time of war were a bad idea  and that they violated his  conscience  but somewhere along the way to the republican nomination  i guess he figured that he had to stop speaking his mind and start towing the line   because now he wants to make those tax cuts permanent  so i respect senator mccain  and i honor his service to this nation  but i don't think america can afford four more years of the failed bush policies  and that's what he's offering  we need to roll back the bush mccain tax cuts and invest in things like health care that are really important  instead of giving tax breaks to the wealthy who don't need them and weren't even asking for them  we should be putting a middle class tax cut into the pockets of working families  that's why i'm the only candidate in this race who's proposed a tax cut that would save our families   a year  and eliminate income taxes entirely for seniors making less than   but let me be clear   this isn't just about ending the failed policies of the bush years  it's about ending the failed system in washington that produces those policies  for far too long  through both democratic and republican administrations  washington has allowed wall street to use lobbyists and campaign contributions to rig the system and get its way  no matter what it costs ordinary americans  think about it  the top mortgage lenders spend   million lobbying congress  and we wonder why washington looked the other way when they were tricking families into buying homes they couldn't afford  drug and insurance companies spend   billion on lobbying  and we wonder why the cost of health care continues to shoot up  when george bush put dick cheney in charge of energy policy  cheney met with the environmentalist groups once  he met with the renewable energy groups once  and he met with the oil and gas companies forty times  so it's no wonder exxon mobile is making   billion a quarter when you're paying close to   a gallon for gas  we need a president who's thinking about not just wall street  but main street  who's not just looking to bump up a corporate bottom line  but to do what's right for the american people  because that's the only way we're going to bring about real change   change that will make a lasting difference in the lives of ordinary americans  i believe i can bring about that change   because i'm the only candidate in this race who's actually worked to rein in the power of lobbyists by passing historic ethics reforms in illinois and in the u s  senate  and i'm the only candidate who isn't taking a dime from washington lobbyists and pacs  they have not funded my campaign  they will not run my administration  and they will not drown out the voices of the american people  of working people  of unions when i'm president of the united states  your voices will be heard  if you have any doubts  you can ask the union leaders in illinois  when i was home talking to some of the local leaders there a couple of years ago  they told me they were being underbid on projects because unscrupulous builders were gaming the system  and i listened  they said that on some construction jobs  those builders were calling their employees  independent contractors  to get out of having to pay employment taxes and workers comp or overtime  that didn't sound right to me  so i set about leading an effort with senator durbin  senator kennedy and others in the senate to end this practice  because if you're doing the same work as other employees  you should have worker protections  the same ability to organize  and the same wages and benefits  and i'll fight to make that the law of the land when i'm president of the united states  we'll make sure washington serves nobody's interests but the people's  because i don't know about you  but i'm tired of playing defense  i'm ready to play some offense  i know the building and construction trades are ready to play offense  we're ready to play offense for the minimum wage  we're ready to play offense for retirement security  we're ready to play offense for universal health care  it's time we stood up to the drug and insurance companies who've been blocking reform for too long and tell them enough is enough  i refuse to accept that in the richest nation on earth  we have to stand by while   million americans go without health insurance  and millions more are being driven to financial ruin trying to pay their medical bills  i'm tired of seeing union members having to spend all their time negotiating about the health care they already have when they should be negotiating for better wages that can support their families  we're going to change that  we're going to work with employers who are providing health care for their employees and lower premiums by up to   per family per year  and for those who don't have health care  we're going to set up a plan that's as good as the one i have as a member of congress  and we're not going to do it twenty years from now  or ten years from now  we're going to do it by the end of my first term as president of the united states of america  we're ready to play offense for working americans  we need to make sure workers building america's infrastructure are making the prevailing wage and getting the benefits they deserve  after katrina  george bush suspended davis bacon  families had nothing left  whole communities had been destroyed  but george bush thought people didn't deserve to make   or   bucks an hour to rebuild that city  and john mccain isn't much different  he seems to think davis bacon is something that comes from a pig farm  he's opposed it time and time again  that's wrong  we need to strengthen davis bacon  and make sure any new infrastructure projects we're proposing adhere to davis bacon standards  and that's what i'll do when i'm president of the united states of america  but it's not enough to make sure we're paying workers fair wages and benefits  we need to make sure the government uses project labor agreements to encourage completion of projects on time and on budget  one of the first things george bush did when he got into office was to ban plas  that's bad for workers and bad for america  and that's why one of the first things i'll do as president will be to repeal that ban and put plas back into place  it's time we had a president who didn't choke saying the word  union  it's time we had a democratic nominee who didn't choke saying the word  union  we need to strengthen our unions by letting them do what they do best   organize our workers  if a majority of workers want a union  they should get a union  and that is why i'll fight for and why i intend to sign the employee free choice act when it lands on my desk in the white house  here's what else we'll do   we'll put americans back to work  i applaud your partnership with helmets to hardhats  i believe we have a responsibility to serve our soldiers as well as they're serving us  and by helping make sure they have the skills to work in the trades when they come home  you're living up to that responsibility  as president  i'll support funding for this critical program  and we won't just promote job training  we'll promote job creation  that's why we'll pass what i'm calling the patriot employer act that i've been working on since i got to the senate   because in my administration  we're not going to give tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  we'll give them to companies that create good jobs with decent wages here in america  we're going to invest in this country  back in the  's  americans were put to work building the interstate highway system and that helped expand our middle class  we need to show the same kind of leadership today  that's why i've called for a national infrastructure reinvestment bank that will invest   billion over ten years and generate millions of new jobs  we can't keep standing by while our roads and bridges and airports crumble and decay  for our economy  our safety  and our workers  we have to rebuild america  investing in america means investing in the jobs of the future  we shouldn't be sending billions of dollars to foreign nations because of our addiction to oil  we should be investing in american made solar panels  windmills  and clean coal technology  that's why i've proposed investing   billion over the next ten years in the green energy sector  this will create up to five million new american jobs   and those are jobs that pay well  and can't be outsourced  that's why this will be a priority in my administration  now  i know some will say we can't afford all this  but it seems to me   if we can spend   billion a month rebuilding iraq  we can spend   billion a year in our own country to create jobs and strengthen the long term competitiveness of our economy  but if we're serious about fighting for our workers here at home  we've got to fight for them around the world  now  the truth is trade is here to stay  and that if we have strong labor and environmental protections in our agreements  and if our trading partners are playing by the rules  trade can be a good thing for our workers and our economy  but what we can't do is ignore violence against union organizers in colombia  what we can't do is sign trade deals that put the interests of multinational corporations ahead of the interests of our workers or our environment  that's why i opposed nafta  and cafta  and that's why i'll make sure our trade agreements work for all americans when i'm president of the united states  so make no mistake   the american people have a choice in this election  we can talk about our economic problems all we want  but unless we change the broken system in washington  nothing else is going to change  we can talk all we want about standing up for our workers  but unless we have a president you can trust to listen and put working americans first  nothing is really going to change  and you can trust me  because politics didn't lead me to working folks  working folks led me to politics  i was standing with american workers on the streets of chicago twenty years ago  and the reason i'm here today is because i don't want to wake up one day many years from now and see that our workers are still being denied the wages and benefits and rights that they deserve  or that we still haven't made the investments in infrastructure and in training our workers that we desperately need  the reason i'm here today is because i know what it's like to go to college on student loans  and see a mother get sick and worry that maybe she can't pay the bills  i know what it's like to have to scratch and work and claw to build a better life for your family  and i don't want to wake up many years from now and find that the american dream is still out of reach for too many americans  the reason i'm here today is because i believe that if we can just put an end to the politics of division and distraction  and reclaim that sense that we all have a stake in each other  that we rise and fall as one nation  if we can just unite this country around a common purpose   black  white  hispanic  asian  and native american  labor and management  democrats  republicans  and independents   there's no obstacle we cannot overcome  no destiny we cannot fulfill  that's the fundamental truth i learned on the streets of chicago  that's the idea at the heart of the building and construction trades  and that's the opportunity we have in this election  there is a moment in the life of every generation where that spirit of unity and hopefulness has to come through if we're going to make our mark on history  this is our moment  this is our time  i'm proud and honored that the first union endorsement i received in this campaign was from a building and construction trades union   the plumbers and pipefitters  and i'd be proud and honored to have all of your support  and if you will march with me  and organize with me  and if you vote for me  then i promise you this  we will not just win this democratic nomination  we will win the general election and then together   you and i   we're going to change this country  and we're going to change this world  thank you "], ["obama1", "it's an honor to have the support of so many veterans across the great state of pennsylvania  including so many brave men and women who served in afghanistan and iraq  this includes my friend congressman patrick murphy  and my pennsylvania veterans coordinator koby langley  we've seen a tremendous grassroots effort  as these young vets have organized  held meetings  and gone door to door to talk about the change we need to bring to washington  as a candidate for president  i know that i am running to become commander in chief   to safeguard our security  and to keep a sacred trust to serve our veterans as well as they have served us  there is no responsibility that i take more seriously  because america's commitment to our servicemen and women begins at enlistment  and it must never end  without that commitment  i probably wouldn't be here today  my grandfather   stanley dunham   enlisted after pearl harbor and went on to march in patton's army  my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line  and my mother was born at fort leavenworth  after my grandfather stood up for his country  america stood by him  he went to college on the gi bill  bought his first home with help from fha  and moved his family west to hawaii  where he and my grandmother helped raise me  today  he is buried in the punchbowl  the national memorial cemetery of the pacific  where   victims of pearl harbor are laid to rest  i knew him when he was older  but i think about him now and then as he enlisted   a man of   fresh faced with an easy smile   when i meet young men and women signing up to serve today  these sons and daughters of america are the best and the bravest among us  they are a part of an unbroken line of heroes that overthrew a king  freed the slaves  faced down fascism  and fought for freedom in korea and vietnam  from kuwait to the balkans  today  they are serving brilliantly in the face of grave danger in afghanistan  iraq and around the world  when our troops go into battle  they serve no faction or party  they represent no race or region  instead  each and every one of them serves together  and fights together  and bleeds together for our highest ideals  the ideal summed up here in pennsylvania by president lincoln   government of the people  by the people  and for the people  we honor their service to this ideal every time we fly the flag  but the true measure of our patriotism is not taken on veterans day or memorial day   the true measure is how we provide for those who serve  and for their families  after the guns fall silent and the cameras are turned off  and it is my strong belief that over the last few years  we have not always kept that sacred trust   we have not served our veterans as well as they have served us  we've heard rhetoric that hasn't been matched by resources  we've seen second rate conditions at walter reed  we've had unpredictable and insufficient time for our troops at home between deployments  our military families have been left to fend for themselves while spouses and parents are sent to fight tour after tour after tour of duty  it's not acceptable  you cannot lead this country into war  and then fail to care for those who have served  and for their families  it starts with protecting the fundamental rights of our troops  they have fought across the world so that others have the right to vote  but here at home  the bush administration has refused to help wounded warriors register  there is nothing patriotic about denying wounded troops the ability to vote  it's time for the va to do the right thing  it's time to reverse this shameful decision  it's also time to be straight with the american people about the sacrifices that are being made  for years  this administration has refused to count all of our wounded men and women in uniform  in iraq alone  tens of thousands of troops who were injured or fell ill have not been counted in our casualty numbers  going against the military's own standards from past wars  it's time to stop hiding the full cost of this war  it's time to honor the full measure of sacrifice of our troops  and to prepare for the cost of their care  i am running on a record of standing up for wounded warriors on the senate veteran's affairs committee  an assignment i sought out when i joined the senate  i led a bipartisan effort to improve outpatient facilities  slash red tape  and reform the disability process   because recovering troops should go to the front of the line  and they shouldn't have to fight to get there  and anyone who has visited a military hospital has seen spouses who don't see visiting hours as part time  that's why i passed legislation to give family members health care while they care for injured troops  and introduced a bill to give family members protection so they don't have to choose between caring for a loved one and keeping a job  i've also worked to confront the signature injuries of the wars in iraq and afghanistan   ptsd and traumatic brain injury  for far too many troops and their families  the war doesn't end when they come home  that's why i've passed measures to increase screening for these unseen wounds  and helped lead a bipartisan effort to stop the unfair practice of kicking out troops who suffer from them  and when i'm president  we'll enhance mental health screening and treatment at all levels  from enlistment  to deployment  to reentry into civilian life  we have called on our troops and their families for so much these last few years  but we haven't always issued that call responsibly  it's not enough to restore twelve month army deployments   we need to restore adequate training and time at home between deployments  and we must recognize that when we deploy our troops  our military families also go to war  that's why we need to provide more counseling and resources to help families cope with multiple tours  and we know that the sacred trust does not end when the uniform comes off  that's why it's time to build a  st century va  no more red tape   it's time to give every service member electronic copies of medical and service records upon discharge  no more shortfalls   we'll fully fund va health care  no more delays   we'll pass on time budgets  no more means testing   it's time to allow every veteran into the va system  i'm tired of hearing stories about vets navigating a broken vba bureaucracy  we need to hire additional workers  and create an electronic system that is fully linked up to military records and the va's health network  and i will have a simple principle for veterans sleeping on our streets  zero tolerance  i've fought for this in the senate  and as president i'll expand housing vouchers  and launch a new supportive services housing program to prevent at risk veterans and their families from sliding into homelessness  finally  we need to make sure that every veteran has the same opportunity that my grandfather had under the gi bill  that's why i'm proud to co sponsor jim webb's gi bill for the  st century  it's time to make sure that every veteran has the support they need to get an education that puts them on a pathway to their dreams  it's past time that congress passed this bill  america stood by my grandfather when he took off the uniform  and it never left his side  i will never forget the day that we laid him to rest  in a cemetery lined with the graves of americans who have sacrificed for our country  we heard the solemn notes of taps and the crack of guns fired in salute  we watched as a folded flag was handed to our family and the coffin was lowered into that hallowed ground  it was a final act of a nation's service to stanley dunham in return for his service to america  we must always remember that we honor our highest ideals by honoring the men and women who have sacrificed for those ideals  that is the work that lies before us  and that is what i will do every day as commander in chief  i will have no greater calling than standing by those who have answered our country's call "], ["obama1", "i want to start by congratulating senator clinton on her victory tonight  and i want to thank the hundreds of thousands of pennsylvanians who stood with our campaign today  there were a lot of folks who didn't think we could make this a close race when it started  but we worked hard  and we traveled across the state to big cities and small towns  to factory floors and vfw halls  and now  six weeks later  we closed the gap  we rallied people of every age and race and background to our cause  and whether they were inspired for the first time or for the first time in a long time  we registered a record number of voters who will lead our party to victory in november  these americans cast their ballot for the same reason you came here tonight  for the same reason that millions of americans have gone door to door and given whatever small amount they can to this campaign  for the same reason that we began this journey just a few hundred miles from here on a cold february morning in springfield   because we believe that the challenges we face are bigger than the smallness of our politics  and we know that this election is our chance to change it  after fourteen long months  it's easy to forget this from time to time   to lose sight of the fierce urgency of this moment  it's easy to get caught up in the distractions and the silliness and the tit for tat that consumes our politics  the bickering that none of us are immune to  and that trivializes the profound issues   two wars  an economy in recession  a planet in peril  but that kind of politics is not why we're here  it's not why i'm here and it's not why you're here  we're here because of the more than one hundred workers in logansport  indiana who just found out that their company has decided to move its entire factory to taiwan  we're here because of the young man i met in youngsville  north carolina who almost lost his home because he has three children with cystic fibrosis and couldn't pay their medical bills  who still doesn't have health insurance for himself or his wife and lives in fear that a single illness could cost them everything  we're here because there are families all across this country who are sitting around the kitchen table right now trying to figure out how to pay their insurance premiums  and their kids' tuition  and still make the mortgage so they're not the next ones in the neighborhood to put a for sale sign in the front yard  who will lay awake tonight wondering if next week's paycheck will cover next month's bills  we're not here to talk about change for change's sake  but because our families  our communities  and our country desperately need it  we're here because we can't afford to keep doing what we've been doing for another four years  we can't afford to play the same washington games with the same washington players and expect a different result  not this time  not now  we already know what we're getting from the other party's nominee  john mccain has offered this country a lifetime of service  and we respect that  but what he's not offering is any meaningful change from the policies of george w  bush  john mccain believes that george bush's iraq policy is a success  so he's offering four more years of a war with no exit strategy  a war that's sending our troops on their third tour  and fourth tour  and fifth tour of duty  a war that's costing us billions of dollars a month and hasn't made us any safer  john mccain said that george bush's economic policies have led to  great progress  over the last seven years  and so he's promising four more years of tax cuts for ceos and corporations who didn't need them and weren't asking for them  tax cuts that he once voted against because he said they  offended his conscience  well they may have stopped offending john mccain's conscience somewhere along the road to the white house  but george bush's economic policies still offend ours  because i don't think that the   americans who've lost their jobs this year are seeing the great progress that john mccain has seen  i don't think the millions of americans losing their homes have seen that progress  i don't think the families without health care and the workers without pensions have seen that progress  and if we continue down the same reckless path  i don't think that future generations who'll be saddled with debt will see these as years of progress  we already know that john mccain offers more of the same  the question is not whether the other party will bring about change in washington   the question is  will we  because the truth is  the challenges we face are not just the fault of one man or one party  how many years   how many decades   have we been talking about solving our health care crisis  how many presidents have promised to end our dependence on foreign oil  how many jobs have gone overseas in the  s  and the  s  and the  s  and we still haven't done anything about it  and we know why  in every election  politicians come to your cities and your towns  and they tell you what you want to hear  and they make big promises  and they lay out all these plans and policies  but then they go back to washington when the campaign's over  lobbyists spend millions of dollars to get their way  the status quo sets in  and instead of fighting for health care or jobs  washington ends up fighting over the latest distraction of the week  it happens year after year after year  well this is your chance to say  not this year  this is your chance to say  not this time  we have a choice in this election  we can be a party that says there's no problem with taking money from washington lobbyists   from oil lobbyists and drug lobbyists and insurance lobbyists  we can pretend that they represent real americans and look the other way when they use their money and influence to stop us from reforming health care or investing in renewable energy for yet another four years  or this time  we can recognize that you can't be the champion of working americans if you're funded by the lobbyists who drown out their voices  we can do what we've done in this campaign  and say that we won't take a dime of their money  we can do what i did in illinois  and in washington  and bring both parties together to rein in their power so we can take our government back  it's our choice  we can be a party that thinks the only way to look tough on national security is to talk  and act  and vote like george bush and john mccain  we can use fear as a tactic  and the threat of terrorism to scare up votes  or we can decide that real strength is asking the tough questions before we send our troops to fight  we can see the threats we face for what they are   a call to rally all americans and all the world against the common challenges of the  st century   terrorism and nuclear weapons  climate change and poverty  genocide and disease  that's what it takes to keep us safe in the world  that's the real legacy of roosevelt and kennedy and truman  we can be a party that says and does whatever it takes to win the next election  we can calculate and poll test our positions and tell everyone exactly what they want to hear  or we can be the party that doesn't just focus on how to win but why we should  we can tell everyone what they need to hear about the challenges we face  we can seek to regain not just an office  but the trust of the american people that their leaders in washington will tell them the truth  that's the choice in this election  we can be a party of those who only think like we do and only agree with all our positions  we can continue to slice and dice this country into red states and blue states  we can exploit the divisions that exist in our country for pure political gain  or this time  we can build on the movement we've started in this campaign   a movement that's united democrats  independents  and republicans  a movement of young and old  rich and poor  white  black  hispanic  asian  and native american  because one thing i know from traveling to forty six states this campaign season is that we're not as divided as our politics suggests  we may have different stories and different backgrounds  but we hold common hopes for the future of this country  in the end  this election is still our best chance to solve the problems we've been talking about for decades   as one nation  as one people  fourteen months later  that is still what this election is about  millions of americans who believe we can do better   that we must do better   have put us in a position to bring about real change  now it's up to you  indiana  you can decide whether we're going to travel the same worn path  or whether we chart a new course that offers real hope for the future  during the course of this campaign  we've all learned what my wife reminds me of all the time   that i am not a perfect man  and i will not be a perfect president  and so while i will always listen to you  and be honest with you  and fight for you every single day for the next for years  i will also ask you to be a part of the change that we need  because in my two decades of public service to this country  i have seen time and time again that real change doesn't begin in the halls of washington  but on the streets of america  it doesn't happen from the top down  it happens from the bottom up  i also know that real change has never been easy  and it won't be easy this time either  the status quo in washington will fight harder than they ever have to divide us and distract us with ads and attacks from now until november  but don't ever forget that you have the power to change this country  you can make this election about how we're going to help those workers in logansport  how we're going to re train them  and educate them  and make our workforce competitive in a global economy  you can make this election about how we're going to make health care affordable for that family in north carolina  how we're going to help those families sitting around the kitchen table tonight pay their bills and stay in their homes  you can make this election about how we plan to leave our children and all children a planet that's safer and a world that still sees america the same way my father saw it from across the ocean   as a beacon of all that is good and all that is possible for all mankind  it is now our turn to follow in the footsteps of all those generations who sacrificed and struggled and faced down the greatest odds to perfect our improbable union  and if we're willing to do what they did  if we're willing to shed our cynicism and our doubts and our fears  if we're willing to believe in what's possible again  then i believe that we won't just win this primary election  we won't just win this election in november  we will change this country  and keep this country's promise alive in the twenty first century  thank you  and may god bless the united states of america "], ["obama1", "senator barack obama  before i start taking questions i want to open it up with a couple of comments about what we saw and heard yesterday  i have spent my entire adult life trying to bridge the gap between different kinds of people  that's in my dna  trying to promote mutual understanding to insist that we all share common hopes and common dreams as americans and as human beings  that's who i am  that's what i believe  that's what this campaign has been about  yesterday  we saw a very different vision of america  i am outraged by the comments that were made and saddened over the spectacle that we saw yesterday  you know  i have been a member of trinity united church of christ since   i have known reverend wright for almost   years  the person i saw yesterday was not the person that i met   years ago  his comments were not only divisive and destructive  but i believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate and i believe that they do not portray accurately the perspective of the black church  they certainly don't portray accurately my values and beliefs  and if reverend wright thinks that that's political posturing  as he put it  then he doesn't know me very well  and based on his remarks yesterday  well  i may not know him as well as i thought  either  now  i've already denounced the comments that had appeared in these previous sermons  as i said  i had not heard them before  and i gave him the benefit of the doubt in my speech in philadelphia  explaining that he has done enormous good in the church  he's built a wonderful congregation  the people of trinity are wonderful people  and what attracted me has always been their ministry's reach beyond the church walls  but when he states and then amplifies such ridiculous propositions as the u s  government somehow being involved in aids  when he suggests that minister farrakhan somehow represents one of the greatest voices of the  th and  st century  when he equates the united states wartime efforts with terrorism  then there are no excuses  they offend me  they rightly offend all americans  and they should be denounced  and that's what i'm doing very clearly and unequivocally here today  let me just close by saying this  i   we started this campaign with the idea that the problems that we face as a country are too great to continue to be divided  that  in fact  all across america people are hungry to get out of the old divisive politics of the past  i have spoken and written about the need for us to all recognize each other as americans  regardless of race or religion or region of the country  that the only way we can deal with critical issues  like energy and health care and education and the war on terrorism  is if we are joined together  and the reason our campaign has been so successful is because we had moved beyond these old arguments  what we saw yesterday out of reverend wright was a resurfacing and  i believe  an exploitation of those old divisions  whatever his intentions  that was the result  it is antithetical to our campaign  it is antithetical to what i am about  it is not what i think american stands for  and i want to be very clear that moving forward  reverend wright does not speak for me  he does not speak for our campaign  i cannot prevent him from continuing to make these outrageous remarks  but what i do want him to be very clear about  as well as all of you and the american people  is that when i say i find these comments appalling  i mean it  it contradicts everything that i'm about and who i am  and anybody who has worked with me  who knows my life  who has read my books  who has seen what this campaign's about  i think  will understand that it is completely opposed to what i stand for and where i want to take this country  last point  i'm particularly distressed that this has caused such a distraction from what this campaign should be about  which is the american people  their situation is getting worse  and this campaign has never been about me  it's never been about senator clinton or john mccain  it's not about reverend wright  people want some help in stabilizing their lives and securing a better future for themselves and their children  and that's what we should be talking about  and the fact that reverend wright would think that somehow it was appropriate to command the stage  for three or four consecutive days  in the midst of this major debate  is something that not only makes me angry but also saddens me  so with that  let me take some questions  q  what are you going to do   q  senator   q  senator   sen  obama  yeah  go ahead  q  why the change of tone from yesterday  when you spoke to us on the tarmac yesterday  you didn't have this sense of anger  outrage   sen  obama  yeah  i'll be honest with you  because i hadn't seen it yet  q  and that was the difference you   sen  obama  yes  q  had you heard the reports about the aids comment  sen  obama  i had not  i had not seen the transcript  what i had heard was that he had given a performance  and i thought at the time that it would be sufficient simply to reiterate what i had said in philadelphia  upon watching it  what became clear to me was that it was more than just a   it was more than just him defending himself  what became clear to me was that he was presenting a world view that   that   that contradicts who i am and what i stand for  and what i think particularly angered me was his suggestion somehow that my previous denunciation of his remarks were somehow political posturing  anybody who knows me and anybody who knows what i'm about knows that   that i am about trying to bridge gaps and that i see the   the commonality in all people  and so when i start hearing comments about conspiracy theories and aids and suggestions that somehow minister farrakhan has   has been a great voice in the  th century  then that goes directly at who i am and what i believe this country needs  jeff  q  senator  what do you expect or what do you plan to do about this right now to further distance yourself  if you think you're going to do that  and does this say about your judgment to superdelegates  who are right trying to decide which democratic nominee is better  because your candidacy has been based on judgment  what does this say about it  sen  obama  well  look  as i said before  the person i saw yesterday was not the person that i had come to know over   years  i understand that   i think he was pained and angered from what had happened previously  during the first stage of this controversy  i think he felt vilified and attacked  and i understand that he wanted to defend himself  i understand that  you know  he's gone through difficult times of late  and that he's leaving his ministry after many years  and so  you know  that may account for the change  but the insensitivity and the outrageousness  of his statements and his performance in the question and answer period yesterday  i think  shocked me  it surprised me  as i said before  this is an individual who has built a very fine church and a church that is well  respected throughout chicago  during the course of me attending that church  i had not heard those kinds of statements being made or those kinds of views being promoted  and i did not vet my pastor before i decided to run for the presidency  i was a member of the church  so you know  i think what it says is that  you know  i have not  you know  i did not run through   run my pastor through the paces or review every one of the sermons that he had made over the last   years  but i don't think that anybody could attribute those ideas to me  q  what effect do you think this is going to have on your campaign  sen  obama  you know  that's something that you guys will have to figure out  and you know  obviously we've got elections in four or five days  so we'll find out  you know  what impact it has  but ultimately i think that the american people know that we have to do better than we're doing right now  i think that they believe in the ideas of this campaign  i think they are convinced that special interest have dominated washington too long  i think they are convinced that we've got to get beyond some of the same political games that we've been playing  i think they believe that we need to speak honestly and truthfully about how we're going to solve issues like energy or health care  and i believe that this campaign has inspired a lot of people  and that's part of what  you know  going back to what you asked  mike  about why i feel so strongly about this today  you know  after seeing reverend wright's performance  i felt as if there was a complete disregard  for what the american people are going through and the need for them to rally together to solve these problems  you know  now is the time for us not to get distracted  now is the time for us to pull together  and that's what we've been doing in this campaign  and  you know  there was a sense that that did not matter to reverend wright  what mattered was him commanding center stage  q  have you had a conversation with reverend wright and   sen  obama  no  q  what's going to happen if these distractions continue  sen  obama  well  the   i want to use this press conference to make people absolutely clear that obviously whatever relationship i had with reverend wright has changed as a consequence of this  i don't think that he showed much concern for me  i don't   more importantly  i don't think he showed much concern for what we are trying to do in this campaign and what we're trying to do for the american people and with the american people  and obviously  he's free to speak out on issues that are of concern to him and he can do it in any ways that he wants  but i feel very strongly that   well  i want to make absolutely clear that i do not subscribe to the views that he expressed  i believe they are wrong  i think they are destructive  and to the extent that he continues to speak out  i do not expect those views to be attributed to me  q  i remember after the story   when the story immediately broke  trinity church   the current pastor kind of defended reverend wright  i'm wondering   i don't know how they reacted to the latest  but i'm wondering if you continue planning on attending trinity  sen  obama  well  you know  the new pastor   the young pastor  reverend otis moss  is a wonderful young pastor  and as i said  i still very much value the trinity community  this   i'll be honest  this obviously has put strains on that relationship  not because of the members or because of reverend moss but because this has become such a spectacle  and  you know  when i go to church it's not for spectacle  it's to pray and to find   to find a stronger sense of faith  it's not to posture politically  it's not   you know  it's not to hear things that violate my core beliefs  and so   you know  and i certainly don't want to provide a distraction for those who are worshipping at trinity  so as of this point  i'm a member of trinity  i haven't had a discussion with reverend moss about it  so i can't tell you how he's reacting and how he's responding  okay  katherine  sp  q  senator  i'm wondering   to sort of follow on jeff's question about you  know  why it's a little different now  have you heard from some of your supporters   you know  you have some    off mike    supporters who expressed any alarm about what this might be doing to the campaign  sen  obama  well  look  the   i mean  i don't think that it's that hard to figure out from   if it was just a purely political perspective  you know  my reaction has more to do with what i want this campaign to be about and who i am  and i want to make certain that people understand who i am  in some ways  what reverend wright said yesterday directly contradicts everything that i've done during my life  it contradicts how i was raised and the setting in which i was raised  it contradicts my decisions to pursue a career of public service  it contradicts the issues that i've worked on politically  it contradicts what i've said in my books  it's contradicts what i said my convention speech in   it contradicts my announcement  it contradicts everything that i've been saying on this campaign trail  and what i tried to do in philadelphia was to provide a context and to lift up some of the contradictions and complexities of race in america   of which  you know  reverend wright is a part and we're all a part   and try to make something constructive out of it  but there wasn't anything constructive out of yesterday  all it was  was a bunch of rants that   that aren't grounded in truth  and you know  i can't construct something positive out of that  i can understand it  i  you know  the   you know  people do all sorts of things  and as i said before  i continue to believe that reverend wright has been a   a   a leader in the south side  i think that the church he built is outstanding  i think that he has preached in the past some wonderful sermons  he provided  you know  valuable contributions to my family  but at a certain point  if what somebody says contradicts what you believe so fundamentally  and then he questions whether or not you believe it in front of the national press club  then that's enough  that's   that's a show of disrespect to me  it's a   it is also  i think  an insult to what we've been trying to do in this campaign  q  senator  did you discuss with your wife  after having seen reverend wright    off mike    and what was her   sen  obama  yeah  no  she was similarly   anger  joe  q  reverend wright said that it was not an attack on him but an attack on the black church  first of all  do you agree with that  and second of all  the strain of theology that he preached  black liberation theology  you explained something about the anger  that feeds some of the sentiments in the church  in philadelphia  how important a strain is liberation theology in the black church  and why did you choose to attend a church that preached that  sen  obama  well  first of all  in terms of liberation theology  i'm not a theologian  so i think to some theologians  there might be some well worked out theory of what constitutes liberation theology versus non liberation theology  i went to church and listened to sermons  and in the sermons that i heard  and this is true  i do think  across the board in many black churches  there is an emphasis on the importance of social struggle  the importance of striving for equality and justice and fairness   a social gospel  so i think a lot of people would rather  rather than using a fancy word like that  simply talk about preaching the social gospel  and that   there's nothing particularly odd about that  dr  king obviously was the most prominent example of that kind of preaching  but you know  what i do think can happen  and i didn't see this as a member of the church but i saw it yesterday  is when you start focusing so much on the plight of the historically oppressed  that you lose sight of what we have in common  that it overrides everything else  that we're not concerned about the struggles of others because we're looking at things only through a particular lens  then it doesn't describe properly what i believe  in the power of faith  to overcome but also to bring people together  now  you had a first question  joe  that i don't remember  q  do you think   sen  obama  do i think   q   off mike  sen  obama  you know  the   i did not view the initial round of soundbites  that triggered this controversy  as an attack on the black church  i viewed it as a simplification of who he was  a caricature of who he was and  you know  more than anything  something that piqued a lot of political interest  i didn't see it as an attack on the black church  i mean  probably the only   the only aspect of it that probably had to do with specifically the black church is the fact that some people were surprised when he was shouting  i mean  that is just a black church tradition  and so i think some people interpreted that somehow as   wow  he's really   he's hollering and black preachers holler and whoop and   so that  i think  showed sort of a cultural gap in america  you know  the sad thing is that although the sound bites i've   as i stated  i think created a caricature of him  and when he was in that moyers interview  even though there were some things that  you know  continued to be offensive  at least there was some sense of rounding out the edges  yesterday i think he caricatured himself  and that was a   as i said  that made me angry but also made me sad  staff  last question  sen  obama  richard  q  you talked about giving the benefit of the doubt before   mostly  i guess  in the philadelphia speech  trying to create something positive about that  did you consult with him before the speech or talk to him after the speech in philadelphia to get his reaction    off mike    sen  obama  you know  i tried to talk to him before the speech in philadelphia  wasn't able to reach him because he was on a   he was on a cruise  he had just stepped down from the pulpit  when he got back  i did speak to him  and i   you know  i prefer not to share sort of private conversations between me and him  i will talk to him perhaps some day in the future  but what i can say is that i was very clear that what he had said in those particular snippets  i found objectionable and offensive and that the intention of the speech was to provide context for them but not excuse them  because i found them inexcusable  so   yeah  go ahead  q  the other day  on sunday  you were asked whether   to respond to    off mike    is this   you said you didn't believe in irreparable damage  is this relationship with you and wright irreparably damaged  do you think  sen  obama  there's been great damage  you know  i   it may have been unintentional on his part  but  you know  i do not see that relationship being the same after this  now  to some degree  you know   i know that one thing that he said was true  was that he wasn't   you know  he was never my  quote unquote   spiritual adviser  he was never my  spiritual mentor  he was   he was my pastor  and so to some extent  how  you know  the   the press characterized in the past that relationship  i think  wasn't accurate  but he was somebody who was my pastor  and married michelle and i  and baptized my children  and prayed with us at   when we announced this race  and so  you know   so i'm disappointed  staff  thank you  sen  obama  all right  thank you  guys  appreciate it "], ["obama1", "when i began this campaign for the presidency  i said i was running because i believed that the size of our challenges had outgrown the smallness of our politics in washington   the pettiness and the game playing and the influence peddling that always prevents us from solving the problems we face year after year after year  i ran because i believed that this year   that this moment   was too important to let that happen again  and i had faith that you believed that too   that you were ready for something different  that you were hungry for something new  fifteen months later  we're already doing what none of the cynics in washington thought we could do  in the face of a politics that's tried to divide us and distract us and make this campaign about who's up and who's down and who said what about who  we've built a movement of americans from every race and region and party who desperately want change in washington  i have no illusions about how far we have to go  our road is still long  our climb is still steep  but fifteen months later  i also know that our mission is even more urgent because the challenges facing people across indiana and the country are growing by the day  i'm not telling you anything you don't know  you don't have to turn on the news or follow the stock tickers or wait for all the economists and politicians to agree on what is or is not a recession to know that our economy is in serious trouble  you can feel it in your own lives  and i hear it everywhere i go  like the young man i met in pennsylvania who lost his job but can't afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one  or the woman from anderson who just lost her job  and her pension  and her insurance when the delphi plant closed down   even while the top executives walked away with multi million dollar bonuses  or the families across this country who will sit around the kitchen table tonight and wonder whether next week's paycheck will be enough to cover next month's bills   who will look at their children without knowing if they'll be able to give them the same chances that they had  but here's what washington and wall street don't get  this economy doesn't just jeopardize our financial well being  it offends the most basic values that have made this country what it is  the idea that america is the place where you can make it if you try  that no matter how much money you start with or where you come from or who your parents are  opportunity is yours if you're willing to reach for it and work for it  it's the idea that while there are no guarantees in life  you should able to count on a job that pays the bills  health care for when you get sick  a pension for when you retire  an education for your children that will allow them to fulfill their god given potential  that's who we are as a country  that's the america most of us here know  it's the america our parents and our grandparents grew up knowing  this is the country that gave my grandfather a chance to go to college on the gi bill when he came home from world war ii  a country that gave him and my grandmother   a small town couple from kansas   the chance to buy their first home with a loan from the government  this is the country that made it possible for my mother   a single parent who had to go on food stamps at one point   to send my sister and me to the best schools in the country with the help of scholarships  this is the country that allowed my father in law   a city worker at a south side water filtration plant   to provide for his wife and two children on a single salary  this is a man who was diagnosed at age thirty with multiple sclerosis   who relied on a walker to get himself to work  and yet  every day he went  and he labored  and he sent my wife and her brother to one of the best colleges in the nation  that job didn't just give him a paycheck  it gave him dignity and self worth  it was an america that didn't just reward and honor wealth  but the work and the workers who helped create it  and we are here today looking for the answer to the same question  where is that america today  how many veterans come home from this war without the care they need   how many wander the streets of the richest country on earth without a roof over their heads  how many single parents can't even afford to send their children to the doctor when they get sick  never mind to four years of college  how many workers have suffered the indignity of having to compete with their own children for a minimum wage job at mcdonalds after they gave their lives to a company where the ceo just walked off with that multi million dollar bonus  and most of all  how many years   how many decades   have we talked and talked and talked about these problems while washington has done nothing  or tinkered  or made them worse  there is no doubt that many of these challenges have to do with fundamental shifts in our economy that began decades ago   changes that have torn down borders and barriers and allowed companies to send jobs wherever there's a cheap source of labor  and today  with countries like china and india educating their children longer and better  and revolutions in communication and technology  they can send the jobs wherever there's an internet connection  i saw the beginnings of these changes up close when i moved to the south side of chicago more than two decades ago to help neighborhoods that were devastated when the local steel plant closed  i saw the indignity of joblessness and the hopelessness of lost opportunity  but i also saw that we are not powerless in the face of these challenges  we don't have to sit here and watch our leaders do nothing  i learned that we don't have to consign our children to a future of diminished dreams   a future of fewer opportunities  and that's why i'm running for president today  politics didn't lead me to working people   working people led me to politics  i'm running because we can't afford to settle for a washington where john mccain gets the chance to give us four more years of the same bush policies that have failed us for the last eight  more tax breaks for ceos who make more in a day than some workers make in a year  more tax breaks for the same corporations that ship our jobs overseas  more of the trickle down  on your own philosophy that says there's nothing government can do about the problems we face   so we might as well just hand out a few tax breaks and tell people to buy their own health care  their own education  their own roads  their own bridges  that hasn't worked in the past  and it won't work for our future  we can't afford to settle for a washington where our energy policy  and our health care policy  and our tax policy is sold to the highest bidding lobbyist  we can't keep taking thousands of dollars of their money year after year  election after election  senator clinton says they represent real americans  but you and i know who they really represent   the oil companies and the drug companies and the insurance companies who keep us from bringing down the cost of our premiums and our prescriptions and investing in renewable fuels  we can't afford to settle for a washington where politicians only focus on how to win instead of why we should  where they check the polls before they check their gut  where they only tell us whatever we want to hear whenever we want to hear it  that kind of politics may get them where they need to go  but it doesn't get america where we need to go  and it won't change anything  some of you might have seen that senator clinton's spending a lot of money on a television ad that attacks me for not supporting her and john mccain's idea of a gas tax holiday for the summer  now  this is an idea that will save you   altogether   half a tank of gas  that's thirty cents a day  for three months  that's if the oil companies don't simply jack up their price to fill the gap  as they've done when this was tried before  does anyone here really trust the oil companies to give you the savings when they could just pocket the money themselves  it's a shell game  literally  in a moment of candor  her advisors actually admitted that it wouldn't have much of an effect on gas prices  but  they said  it's a great political issue for senator clinton  so this is not about getting you through the summer  it's about getting elected  and this is what passes for leadership in washington  phony ideas  calculated to win elections instead of actually solving problems  now senator clinton's been using this issue to make the argument that i'm somehow  out of touch  well let me tell you   only in washington can you get away with calling someone out of touch when you're the one who thinks that thirty cents a day is enough to help people who are struggling in this economy  i'll tell you what i think   i think the american people are smarter than washington gives us credit for  i wish i could stand up here and tell you that we could fix our energy problems with a holiday  i wish i could tell you that we can take a time out from trade and bring back the jobs that have gone overseas  i wish i could promise that on day one of my presidency  i could pass every plan and proposal i've outlined in this campaign  but my guess is that you've heard those promises before  you hear them every year  in every election  and afterwards  when everyone goes back to washington  the game playing  and the influence peddling  and the petty bickering continues  nothing gets done  and four years later  we're right back here making the very same promises about the very same problems  well this year you have a choice  if you want to take another chance on the same kind of politics we've come to know in washington  there are other candidates to choose from  but i still believe we need to fundamentally change washington if we want change in america  i still believe this election is bigger than me  or senator clinton  or senator mccain  it's bigger than democrats versus republicans  it's about who we are as americans  it's about whether this country  at this moment  will continue to stand by while the wealthy few prosper at the expense of the hardworking many  or whether we'll stand up and reclaim the american dream for every american  it's about whether we'll watch the chinas and the indias of the world move past us  or whether we'll decide that in the  st century  the home of innovation  and discovery  and progress will still be the united states of america  reclaiming this dream will take more than one election  it will take more than one person or one party  it will take the effort and sacrifice of a nation united  and that's the truth  we can provide relief that's more than a holiday to families who are struggling in this economy  i'm the only candidate who's proposed a genuine middle class tax cut that's paid for in part by closing corporate loopholes and shutting down tax havens  it would save nearly every working family   eliminate income taxes for seniors making under   and provide a mortgage tax credit to struggling homeowners that would cover ten percent of their mortgage interest payment every year  i also have a health care plan that would save the average family   on their premiums and provide the uninsured with the same kind of health care members of congress give themselves  that's real relief  but we can only pay for this if we finally rollback the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest   of americans who don't need them and weren't even asking for them  we may not be able to bring back all the jobs that we've lost to trade  but we can create tomorrow's jobs in this country  i happen to believe in free trade  but we do the cause of trade no favors when we pass agreements that are filled with perks for every special interest under the sun and absolutely no protections for american workers  there's absolutely no reason we should be giving tax breaks to corporations who ship jobs overseas  when i'm president  i will eliminate those tax breaks and give them to companies who create good jobs right here in america  we can also create jobs if we finally get serious about rebuilding our crumbling and decaying national infrastructure  a few years ago  one out of three urban bridges were classified as structurally deficient  and we all saw the tragic results of what that could mean in minnesota last year  it's unacceptable  that's why i'm proposing a national infrastructure reinvestment bank that will invest   billion over ten years and generate nearly two million new jobs   many of them in the construction industry that's been hard hit by this housing crisis  the repairs will be determined not by politics  but by what will maximize our safety  and we'll fund this bank by ending this war in iraq  it's time to stop spending billions of dollars a week trying to put iraq back together and start spending the money on putting america back together instead  and if want to take a permanent holiday from our oil addiction  we can finally get serious about energy independence and create five million new green jobs in the process   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  we'll do what i did when i went to detroit and tell the automakers it's time they raised fuel mileage standards in this country  we'll make companies pay for the pollution they release into the air  we'll tax the record profits of the oil companies  and we'll use that money to invest in clean  affordable  renewable energy like solar power  and wind power  and biofuels  i'll be honest   this transition to a green economy won't come without costs that all of us will have to pay  but it's the only way we'll free ourselves from the whims of middle east dictator  the only way we'll make sure we're not talking about high gas prices five years from now and ten years from now  the only way we can pass on a planet that's still recognizable to our children and their children  and if we want our children to succeed in this global economy   if we want them to be able to compete with children in beijing and bangalore   then we need to make sure that every child  everywhere gets a world class education  from the day they're born until the day they graduate college  that means investing in early childhood education  it means that we need to recruit an army of new teachers by not just talking about how great teachers are  but rewarding them for their greatness with better pay and more support  and it means that in this country   in this global economy   we will not create a small class of the educated few by allowing thousands and thousands of young people to be priced out of college year after year  we are better than that  when i'm president  we'll create a bargain with every american who wants to go to college  we will pay for your tuition if you serve your country in some way for two years after you graduate  real relief for middle class families  seniors  and homeowners  lower premiums for those who have health care and coverage for everyone who wants it  five million green jobs right here in america  a world class education that will allow every american to reach their god given potential and compete with any worker in the world  all of this is possible  but it's just a list of policies until you decide that it's time to make the washington we have look like the america we know   one where the future is not determined by those with money and influence  where common sense and honesty are cherished values  where we are stronger than that which divides us because we realize that in the end  we rise or fall as one nation   as one people  it was forty years ago this may that robert kennedy took his unlikely campaign to create a new kind of politics to indiana  and as he campaigned in fort wayne  he laid out a vision that america we know  he said   income and education and homes do not make a nation  nor do land and borders  shared ideals and principles  joined purposes and hopes   these make a nation  and that is our great task  it is still our task today  we've always known this wouldn't be easy  the change we're looking for never is  generations before us have fought wars and revolutions  they've struggled and they've sacrificed  they've stood up and spoke out and marched through the streets for the opportunities that we enjoy  and that's why the only way a black guy named barack obama who was born in hawaii  and started his career on the streets of chicago  can win this race   if you decide that you've had enough of the way things are  if you decide that this election is bigger than flag pins and sniper fire and the comments of a former pastor   bigger than the differences between what we look like or where we come from or what party we belong to  and if you do   if you decide that this moment is about what kind of country we'll be in the next year and the next century  about how we'll provide jobs to the jobless and opportunity to those without it  about health care and good schools and a green planet  about giving our children a better world and a brighter future   then i ask you to enlist your neighbors  and knock on doors  and work your heart out from now until tuesday  in the face of all cynicism  and doubt  and fear  i ask you to remember what makes a nation   and to believe that we can once again make this nation the land of limitless possibility and unyielding hope   the place where you can still make it if you try  thank you  and may god bless the united states of america "], ["obama1", "you know  some were saying that north carolina would be a game changer in this election  but today  what north carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in washington  dc  i want to start by congratulating senator clinton on her victory in the state of indiana  and i want to thank the people of north carolina for giving us a victory in a big state  a swing state  and a state where we will compete to win if i am the democratic nominee for president of the united states  when this campaign began  washington didn't give us much of a chance  but because you came out in the bitter cold  and knocked on doors  and enlisted your friends and neighbors in this cause  because you stood up to the cynics  and the doubters  and the nay sayers when we were up and when we were down  because you still believe that this is our moment  and our time  for change   tonight we stand less than two hundred delegates away from securing the democratic nomination for president of the united states  more importantly  because of you  we have seen that it's possible to overcome the politics of division and distraction  that it's possible to overcome the same old negative attacks that are always about scoring points and never about solving our problems  we've seen that the american people aren't looking for more spin or more gimmicks  but honest answers about the challenges we face  that's what you've accomplished in this campaign  and that's how we'll change this country together  this has been one of the longest  most closely fought contests in history  and that's partly because we have such a formidable opponent in senator hillary clinton  tonight  many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided   that senator clinton's supporters will not support me  and that my supporters will not support her  well i'm here tonight to tell you that i don't believe it  yes  there have been bruised feelings on both sides  yes  each side desperately wants their candidate to win  but ultimately  this race is not about hillary clinton or barack obama or john mccain  this election is about you   the american people   and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future  this primary season may not be over  but when it is  we will have to remember who we are as democrats   that we are the party of jefferson and jackson  of roosevelt and kennedy  and that we are at our best when we lead with principle  when we lead with conviction  when we summon an entire nation around a common purpose   a higher purpose  this fall  we intend to march forward as one democratic party  united by a common vision for this country  because we all agree that at this defining moment in history   a moment when we're facing two wars  an economy in turmoil  a planet in peril   we can't afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bush's third term  we need change in america  the woman i met in indiana who just lost her job  and her pension  and her insurance when the plant where she worked at her entire life closed down   she can't afford four more years of tax breaks for corporations like the one that shipped her job overseas  she needs us to give tax breaks to companies that create good jobs here in america  she can't afford four more years of tax breaks for ceos like the one who walked away from her company with a multi million dollar bonus  she needs middle class tax relief that will help her pay the skyrocketing price of groceries  and gas  and college tuition  that's why i'm running for president  the college student i met in iowa who works the night shift after a full day of class and still can't pay the medical bills for a sister who's ill   she can't afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy  that allows insurance companies to discriminate and deny coverage to those americans who need it most  she needs us to stand up to those insurance companies and pass a plan that lowers every family's premiums and gives every uninsured american the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  that's why i'm running for president  the mother in wisconsin who gave me a bracelet inscribed with the name of the son she lost in iraq  the families who pray for their loved ones to come home  the heroes on their third and fourth and fifth tour of duty   they can't afford four more years of a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged  they can't afford four more years of our veterans returning to broken down barracks and substandard care  they need us to end a war that isn't making us safer  they need us to treat them with the care and respect they deserve  that's why i'm running for president  the man i met in pennsylvania who lost his job but can't even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one   he can't afford four more years of an energy policy written by the oil companies and for the oil companies  a policy that's not only keeping gas at record prices  but funding both sides of the war on terror and destroying our planet in the process  he doesn't need four more years of washington policies that sound good  but don't solve the problem  he needs us to take a permanent holiday from our oil addiction by making the automakers raise their fuel standards  corporations pay for their pollution  and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future  that's the change we need  and that's why i'm running for president  the people i've met in small towns and big cities across this country understand that government can't solve all our problems   and we don't expect it to  we believe in hard work  we believe in personal responsibility and self reliance  but we also believe that we have a larger responsibility to one another as americans   that america is a place   that america is the place   where you can make it if you try  that no matter how much money you start with or where you come from or who your parents are  opportunity is yours if you're willing to reach for it and work for it  it's the idea that while there are few guarantees in life  you should be able to count on a job that pays the bills  health care for when you need it  a pension for when you retire  an education for your children that will allow them to fulfill their god given potential  that's the america we believe in  that's the america i know  this is the country that gave my grandfather a chance to go to college on the gi bill when he came home from world war ii  a country that gave him and my grandmother the chance to buy their first home with a loan from the government  this is the country that made it possible for my mother   a single parent who had to go on food stamps at one point   to send my sister and me to the best schools in the country on scholarships  this is the country that allowed my father in law   a city worker at a south side water filtration plant   to provide for his wife and two children on a single salary  this is a man who was diagnosed at age thirty with multiple sclerosis   who relied on a walker to get himself to work  and yet  every day he went  and he labored  and he sent my wife and her brother to one of the best colleges in the nation  it was a job that didn't just give him a paycheck  but a sense of dignity and self worth  it was an america that didn't just reward wealth  but the work and the workers who created it  somewhere along the way  between all the bickering and the influence peddling and the game playing of the last few decades  washington and wall street have lost touch with these values  and while i honor john mccain's service to his country  his ideas for america are out of touch with these values  his plans for the future are nothing more than the failed policies of the past  and his plan to win in november appears to come from the very same playbook that his side has used time after time in election after election  yes  we know what's coming  we've seen it already  the same names and labels they always pin on everyone who doesn't agree with all their ideas  the same efforts to distract us from the issues that affect our lives by pouncing on every gaffe and association and fake controversy in the hope that the media will play along  the attempts to play on our fears and exploit our differences to turn us against each other for pure political gain   to slice and dice this country into red states and blue states  blue collar and white collar  white and black  and brown  this is what they will do   no matter which one of us is the nominee  the question  then  is not what kind of campaign they'll run  it's what kind of campaign we will run  it's what we will do to make this year different  i didn't get into race thinking that i could avoid this kind of politics  but i am running for president because this is the time to end it  we will end it this time not because i'm perfect   i think by now this campaign has reminded all of us of that  we will end it not by duplicating the same tactics and the same strategies as the other side  because that will just lead us down the same path of polarization and gridlock  we will end it by telling the truth   forcefully  repeatedly  confidently   and by trusting that the american people will embrace the need for change  because that's how we've always changed this country   not from the top down  but from the bottom up  when you   the american people   decide that the stakes are too high and the challenges are too great  the other side can label and name call all they want  but i trust the american people to recognize that it's not surrender to end the war in iraq so that we can rebuild our military and go after al qaeda's leaders  i trust the american people to understand that it's not weakness  but wisdom to talk not just to our friends  but our enemies   like roosevelt did  and kennedy did  and truman did  i trust the american people to realize that while we don't need big government  we do need a government that stands up for families who are being tricked out of their homes by wall street predators  a government that stands up for the middle class by giving them a tax break  a government that ensures that no american will ever lose their life savings just because their child gets sick  security and opportunity  compassion and prosperity aren't liberal values or conservative values   they're american values  most of all  i trust the american people's desire to no longer be defined by our differences  because no matter where i've been in this country   whether it was the corn fields of iowa or the textile mills of the carolinas  the streets of san antonio or the foothills of georgia   i've found that while we may have different stories  we hold common hopes  we may not look the same or come from the same place  but we want to move in the same direction   towards a better future for our children and our grandchildren  that's why i'm in this race  i love this country too much to see it divided and distracted at this moment in history  i believe in our ability to perfect this union because it's the only reason i'm standing here today  and i know the promise of america because i have lived it  it is the light of opportunity that led my father across an ocean  it is the founding ideals that the flag draped over my grandfather's coffin stands for   it is life  and liberty  and the pursuit of happiness  it's the simple truth i learned all those years ago when i worked in the shadows of a shuttered steel mill on the south side of chicago   that in this country  justice can be won against the greatest of odds  hope can find its way back to the darkest of corners  and when we are told that we cannot bring about the change that we seek  we answer with one voice   yes we can  so don't ever forget that this election is not about me  or any candidate  don't ever forget that this campaign is about you   about your hopes  about your dreams  about your struggles  about securing your portion of the american dream  don't ever forget that we have a choice in this country   that we can choose not to be divided  that we can choose not to be afraid  that we can still choose this moment to finally come together and solve the problems we've talked about all those other years in all those other elections  this time can be different than all the rest  this time we can face down those who say our road is too long  that our climb is too steep  that we can no longer achieve the change that we seek  this is our time to answer the call that so many generations of americans have answered before   by insisting that by hard work  and by sacrifice  the american dream will endure  thank you  and may god bless the united states of america "], ["obama1", "it's great to be back in oregon  over the last fifteen months  we've travelled to every corner of the united states  now i know that if you listen to washington or pay attention to the pundits  you hear a lot about how divided we are as a people  but that's not what i've found as i've travelled across this great country  everywhere i go  i've been impressed by the values and hopes that we share  in big cities and small towns  among men and women  young and old  black  white  and brown   americans share a faith in simple dreams  a job with wages that can support a family  health care that we can count on and afford  a retirement that is dignified and secure  education and opportunity for our kids  common hopes  american dreams  that's why this election is so important  because for far too many americans  those hopes and dreams are slipping away  we just came through the first period of sustained economic growth since world war ii that saw incomes drop  people are working harder for less  you're paying more for gas  and groceries  and tuition  millions of families are facing foreclosure  we've already lost hundreds of thousands of jobs this year  to be sure  some of these problems are a result of changes in our economy that no one can control  but instead of helping  washington's policies have made it worse  instead of expanding opportunity for working people  we've tried to grow our economy from the top down  and eventually that pain trickled up  instead of making sure that people can live their dreams on main street  we've tilted the scales for special interests and wall street  instead of saying  we're all in this together  as americans  washington has sent a message that says    you're on your own  john mccain has served his country with honor  and i respect that service  but it was dead wrong when he said recently that he thinks our economy has made  great progress  under george bush  is there anyone outside of washington d c  who could truly believe that  do you  senator mccain is running for president to double down on george bush's failed policies  i am running to change them  and that will be the fundamental difference in this election when i am the democratic nominee for president  we have a difference on taxes  john mccain wants to continue george bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  i want to give a tax cut to working people  i admired senator mccain when he said he could not  in good conscience  support the bush tax cuts  but now  as the republican nominee  he's fully embraced them  he wants to give a permanent tax cut to the wealthiest americans who don't need them and didn't ask for them while working people are struggling  and for all his talk about fiscal responsibility  he's proposed   billion in tax cuts without any word about how he'll pay for him  that's exactly the kind of attitude that has shifted the burden on to the middle class  and mortgaged our children's future on a mountain of debt  i think it's time to restore fairness and responsibility to our tax code  we need to reward work   not just wealth  we need to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  and put a tax cut in the pockets of middle class americans  that's why i've proposed a  making work pay  tax credit of up to   for workers  and   for working families  this will cut taxes for   million americans  it will help you deal with rising costs  and give our economy a boost by easing the burden on main street  we have a difference on health care  john mccain wants to continue a george bush approach that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy  that allows insurance companies to discriminate and deny coverage to those americans who need it most  this is exactly the kind of approach that has left out tens of millions of americans  it's why you are struggling with rising costs  and it's why we have failed to solve our health care crisis year after year after year  i think it's time to finally make health care affordable and accessible for every american  we need to stand up to the insurance companies and the drug companies  we need to bring americans together  and we need to pass a plan that lowers every family's premiums  and gives every uninsured american the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  we have a difference on gas prices  john mccain has embraced a gas tax gimmick that   when it's said and done   will save you less than thirty dollars this summer  this is a classic washington fix that's more about getting john mccain through an election than solving your problems  it will put more money in the pockets of the oil companies  it's bad for our environment  and it won't bring own gas prices over the long term   most economists think it will send those prices up  i believe we owe the american people the truth  that's why my plan to lower gas prices raises fuel efficiency standards on cars  invests in alternative energy to end our addiction to oil  and creates millions of new green jobs while saving our planet in the bargain  that's the kind of change we need in washington  we have a fundamental difference on our priorities for the presidency  john mccain wants to continue george bush's war in iraq  losing thousands of lives and spending tens of billions of dollars a month to fight a war that isn't making us safer  i want to end this war  i want to invest that money in america   in our roads and bridges and ports  and i want to invest in millions of green jobs  so that we finally develop renewable energy  end our addiction to oil  bring those gas prices down  and save our planet in the bargain  there will be real differences on the ballot in november  and that's what elections should be about  john mccain will stand with washington's tried and failed approaches of the past  i will stand with the american people on behalf of a new direction for working people  because i believe it's time for america to once again be a place where you can make it if you try  i believe it's time for washington to work for your hopes  for your dreams  that's the choice i'll offer in this campaign  and that's what i'll do every day as president of the united states "], ["obama1", "i want to thank senator rockefeller  not only for that generous introduction  but for his friendship and support in this campaign  i want to thank secretary richard danzig  admiral john natham  and general jim smith for being here with us today and for their distinguished record of service to our country  and i want to thank the people of west virginia   particularly those who have worn the uniform of our country  more of you are veterans here than in almost any other state in the nation  so many guard members from this very armory have been deployed to iraq and afghanistan on tour after tour  year after year  and that means there are more west virginians who've had to say goodbye to these heroes  who've borne the burdens of their absence in ways that are often immeasurable   an empty chair at the dinner table or another mother's day where mom is some place far away  your sacrifice and the sacrifice of your loved ones is immense  and it must never be forgotten  there is an election here tomorrow  i'm honored that some of you will support me  and i understand that many more here in west virginia will probably support senator clinton  but when it's over  what will unify as democrats   what must unify us as americans   is an unyielding commitment to the men and women who've served this nation and an unshakable fidelity to the ideals for which they've risked their lives  without that commitment  many of us wouldn't be here today  i am one of those people  my grandfather   stanley dunham   enlisted after pearl harbor and went on to march in patton's army  my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line while he was gone  and my mother was born at fort leavenworth  when he returned  it was to a country that gave him the chance to college on the gi bill  to buy his first home with a loan from the fha  to move his family west  all the way to hawaii  where he and my grandmother helped raise me  today  my grandfather is buried in the punchbowl  the national memorial cemetery of the pacific  where   victims of pearl harbor are laid to rest  i knew him when he was older  but whenever i meet young men and women along the campaign trail who are serving in the military today  i think about what my grandfather was like when he enlisted   a fresh faced man of twenty three  with a heart laugh and an easy smile  these sons and daughters of america are the best and the bravest among us  they are a part of an unbroken line of heroes who overthrew a king for the sake of an ideal  who freed the slaves and faced down fascism  who fought for freedom in korea and vietnam  from kuwait to the balkans   who still wake up every day to face down the gravest dangers in iraq  afghanistan  and all over the world  when our troops go into battle  they serve no faction or party  they represent no race or region  they are simply americans  they serve and fight and bleed together out of loyalty not just to a place on a map or a certain kind of people  but to a set of ideals that we have been striving for since the first shots rang out at lexington and concord   the idea that america could be governed not by men  but by laws  that we could be equal in the eyes of those laws  that we could be free to say what we want and write what want and worship as we please  that we could have the right to pursue our individual dreams but the obligation to help our fellow citizens pursue theirs  allegiance to these ideals has always been at the core of american patriotism   it's what unites a country of so many different opinions and beliefs  it's why some of us may disagree on our decision to start this war in iraq  but all of us stand united in our support for the brave men and women who wage it  that's how it should be  but it's not how it's always been  one of the saddest episodes in our history was the degree to which returning vets from vietnam were shunned  demonized and neglected by some because they served in an unpopular war  too many of those who opposed the war in vietnam chose to blame not only the leaders who ordered the mission  but the young men who simply answered their country's call  four decades later  the sting of that injustice is a wound that has never fully healed  and one that should never be repeated  the young men and women who choose to serve are defending the very rights and freedoms that allow americans to speak out against government actions we oppose  they deserve our admiration  respect and enduring gratitude  at the same time  we must never forget that honoring this service and upholding these ideals requires more than saluting our veterans as they march by on veterans day or memorial day  it requires marching with them for the care and benefits they have earned it requires standing shoulder to shoulder with our veterans and their families after the guns fall silent and the cameras are turned off  at a time when we're facing the largest homecoming since the second world war  the true test of our patriotism is whether we will serve our returning heroes as well as they've served us  we know that over the last eight years  we've already fallen short of meeting this test  we all learned about the deplorable conditions that were discovered at places like fort bragg and walter reed  we've all walked by a veteran whose home is now a cardboard box on a street corner in the richest nation on earth  we've all heard about what it's like to navigate the broken bureaucracy of the va   the impossibly long lines  or the repeated calls for help that get you nothing more than an answering machine  just a few weeks ago  an  year old world war ii veteran from south carolina told his family   no matter what i apply for at the va  they turn me down  the next day  he walked outside of an outpatient clinic in greenville and took his own life  how can we let this happen  how is that acceptable in the united states of america  the answer is  it's not  it's an outrage  and it's a betrayal   a betrayal   of the ideals that we ask our troops to risk their lives for  but it doesn't have to be this way  not in this country  not if we decide that this time will be different  there are many aspects of this war that have gone inalterably wrong  but caring for our veterans is one thing we can still get right  when i arrived in the senate  i sought out a seat on the veterans affairs committee so i could fight to give our veterans the care they need and the benefits they deserve  we fought to make sure that the claims of disabled veterans in illinois and other states were being heard fairly  and we forced the va to conduct an unprecedented outreach campaign to disabled veterans who receive lower than average benefits  i passed laws to get homeless veterans off the streets and prevent at risk veterans from getting there in the first place  i led a bipartisan effort to improve outpatient facilities at places like walter reed  and slash red tape  and reform the disability process   because recovering troops should go to the front of the line  and they shouldn't have to fight to get there  i passed laws to give family members health care while they care for injured troops  and to provide family members with a year of job protection  so they never have to face a choice between caring for a loved one and keeping a job  but there is so much more work that we need to do in this country  it starts with being honest about the sacrifices that our brave men and women are making  for years  this administration has refused to count all of our casualties in uniform  in iraq alone  tens of thousands of troops who were injured or fell ill have not been counted in our casualty numbers  going against the military's own standards from past wars  it's time to stop hiding the full cost of this war  it's time to honor the full measure of sacrifice of our troops  and to prepare for the cost of their care  that's why i've pledged to build a  st century va as president  it means no more red tape   it's time to give every service member electronic copies of medical and service records upon discharge  it means no more shortfalls   we'll fully fund va health care  and add more vet centers  particularly in rural areas  it means no more delays   we'll pass on time budgets  it means no more means testing   it's time to allow every veteran into the va system  and it means we'll have a simple principle for veterans sleeping on our streets  zero tolerance  as president  i'll build on the work i started in the senate and expand housing vouchers  and launch a new supportive services housing program to prevent at risk veterans and their families from sliding into homelessness  i'll also build on the work i did in the senate to confront one of the signature injuries of the wars in iraq and afghanistan   ptsd  we have to understand that for far too many troops and their families  the war doesn't end when they come home  just the other day our own government's top psychiatric researcher said that because of inadequate mental health care  the number of suicides among veterans of iraq and afghanistan may actually exceed the number of combat deaths  think about that  think about how only half of the returning soldiers with ptsd receive the treatment they need  think of how many we turn away   of how many we let fall through the cracks  we have to do better than this  in the senate  i've helped lead a bipartisan effort to stop the unfair practice of kicking out troops who suffer from them  and when i'm president  we'll enhance mental health screening and treatment at all levels  from enlistment  to deployment  to reentry into civilian life  we also need more mental health professionals  more training to recognize signs and to reject the stigma of seeking care  and we need to dramatically improve screening and treatment for the other signature injury of the war  traumatic brain injury  that's why i passed measures in the senate to increase screening for these injuries  and that's why i'll establish clearer standards of care as president  we have called on our troops and their families for so much during these last years  but we haven't always issued that call responsibly  yes  we need to restore twelve month army deployments  but we also need to restore adequate training and time at home between those deployments  my wife  michelle  met with army spouses the other day in north carolina who told her about the toll it takes to watch your loved one serve tour after tour of duty with little to no time off in between  and they told her something we all need to remember   we don't just deploy our troops overseas  we deploy families  that's why we also need to provide more counseling and resources to help families cope with multiple tours  and when our loved ones do come home  it is time for the united states of america to offer this generation of returning heroes the same thanks we offered that earlier  greatest generation   by giving every veteran the same opportunity that my grandfather had under the gi bill  there is no reason we shouldn't pass the  st century gi bill that is being debated in congress right now  it was introduced by my friend senator jim webb  a marine who served as navy secretary under president ronald reagan  his plan has widespread support from republicans and democrats  it would provide every returning veteran with a real chance to afford a college education  and it would not harm retention  i have great respect for john mccain's service to this country and i know he loves it dearly and honors those who serve  but he is one of the few senators of either party who oppose this bill because he thinks it's too generous  i couldn't disagree more  at a time when the skyrocketing cost of tuition is pricing thousands of americans out of a college education  we should be doing everything we can to give the men and women who have risked their lives for this country the chance to pursue the american dream  the brave americans who fight today believe deeply in this country  and no matter how many you meet  or how many stories of heroism you hear  every encounter reminds that they are truly special  that through their service  they are living out the ideals that stir so many of us as americas   pride  duty  and sacrifice  some of the most inspiring are those you meet at places like walter reed army medical center  they are young men and women who may have lost a limb or even their ability to take care of themselves  but they will never lose the pride they feel for their country  they're not interested in self pity  but yearn to move forward with their lives  and it's this classically american optimism that makes you realize the quality of person we have serving in the united states armed forces  this  after all  is what led them to wear the uniform in the first place   their unwavering belief in the idea of america  the idea that no matter where you come from  or what you look like  or who your parents are  this is a place where anything is possible  where anyone can make it  where we look out for each other  and take care of each other  where we rise and fall as one nation   as one people  it's an idea that's worth fighting for   an idea for which so many americans have given that last full measure of devotion  i can still remember the day that we laid my grandfather to rest  in a cemetery lined with the graves of americans who have sacrificed for our country  we heard the solemn notes of taps and the crack of guns fired in salute  we watched as a folded flag was handed to my grandmother and my grandfather was laid to rest  it was a nation's final act of service and gratitude to stanley dunham   an america that stood by my grandfather when he took off the uniform  and never left his side  abraham lincoln once said   i like to see a man proud of the place in which he lives  but i also like to see a man live so that his place will be proud of him  there is no doubt that we are a nation that is deeply proud of where we live  but it is now our generation's task to live in a way that stanley dunham lived  to live the way that those heroes at walter reed have lived  the way that all those men and women who put on this nation's uniform live each and every day  it is now our task to live so that america will be proud of us  that is true test of patriotism   the test that all of us must meet in the days and years to come  i have no doubt that this nation is up to the challenge  thank you  and may god bless the united states of america "], ["obama1", "it's great to be here in missouri with my good friend claire mccaskill  this is a state that voted for change when you sent claire to the senate in   you voted for change in february when we surprised the pundits and pulled out a victory  and this is a state where we will compete to win when i am the democratic nominee for president  there is a lot of talk these days about how the democratic party is divided  but i'm not worried  because i know that we'll be able to come together quickly behind a common purpose  there's too much that unites us as democrats  there's too much at stake for our country  and there will be a clear choice on november   now there's one thing we know for sure about this election  the name george bush will not be on the ballot  the name of my cousin dick cheney will not be on the ballot  but while the bush cheney ticket won't be up for reelection  the bush cheney policies will  because john mccain is running for four more years of the same approach that has failed the american people  there is a reason that a record number of americans think that we're on the wrong track  we've lost hundreds of thousands of jobs just this year  the cost of everything from health care  to a tank of gas  to college tuition has skyrocketed while wages have stayed stagnant  millions of american families are facing foreclosure  we're spending tens of billions of dollars fighting a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged  meanwhile  americans have lost faith that washington can or will do anything about problems they face day in and day out  because the troubling statistics only begin to tell a story found in communities and at kitchen tables across the country  it's a story of empty factories shut down forever because the jobs have been shipped overseas and nothing took their place  it's the story told by a mother who can't sleep because she can't afford health care for her sick child  a father who lost his job but can't afford a tank of gas so that he can look for a new one  a family that doesn't know where they'll be living in a month or a year because they're about to lose a home  it's a story of an american dream that is slipping away  and what the american people need at this defining moment is leadership that restores the fundamental american belief that you can make it if you try in this country   that your dreams matter more than the demands of special interests or the convenience of political posturing  that's why i'm running for president  that's why we'll be united as democrats  because washington has failed the american people  and this election is our chance to turn the page  john mccain has served his country with honor  and i respect that service  but for two decades  he has supported policies that have shifted the burden on to working people  and his only answer to the problems created by george bush's policies is to give them another four years to fail  just look at where he stands and you'll see that a vote for john mccain is a vote for george bush's third term  four more years of george bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest americans who don't need them and didn't ask for them  four more years of a health care plan that works for the healthy and the wealthy while tens of millions go without care  and families struggle with rising costs  four more years of a president who supports privatizing social security  four more years of a war that has cost us thousands of lives and a trillion dollars without making us safer  while we run up a mountain of debt that is mortgaging our children's future  four more years of a white house that is run by the kind of lobbyists who run john mccain's campaign  while washington tells the american people    you're on your own  well we know that the american people cannot afford any more of the bush mccain program  not this time  not when the stakes are so high  not when the opportunities are so great  we need a new direction in washington  we need new leadership in the white house we know that government cannot solve all of our problems  and we don't expect it to  we don't want our tax dollars wasted on programs that don't work or perks for special interests that don't work for us  we understand that we cannot stop every job from going overseas or build a wall around our economy  and we know we shouldn't  but that is not an excuse to spend another four years doing nothing to reclaim the american dream for working people  we're the nation that built the largest middle class in history  we all have a stake in each other's success  we can't continue an economic program that rewards wall street at the expense of main street because then we all end up hurting  it's time to end a failed approach that tries to build prosperity from the top down  and renew our common prosperity from the bottom up  instead of a tax code that rewards wealth and not work  we'll provide an income tax cut of up to   for a working family  and eliminate income taxes altogether for any retiree making less than   per year  instead of more inaction on health care  we'll finally bring this country together  stand up to the drug companies and insurance companies  and make health care affordable and accessible for every single american  instead of putting a secure retirement at risk  we'll safeguard social security  we'll protect pensions instead of ceo bonuses  and we'll help all americans save more so they can have a retirement that is dignified and secure  instead of gimmicks like a gas tax holiday that rewards the oil companies while doing nothing to lower gas prices in the long term  we'll raise fuel efficiency standards  invest in alternative energy  and create millions of green jobs that will free this country from our addiction to oil  instead of a blank check to fight an endless war in iraq  we can end this war  restore our military  finish the fight against al qaeada  and invest some of those dollars to put millions of americans to work rebuilding our roads and bridges  laying down new rail lines and new broadband  and making sure that all of america can compete and win in the  st century  that's the new direction we need in this country  the other party has already decided to run on the failed policies of the past  that's why we need to be the party that stands for the future  everywhere i go  i meet americans who can't wait another day for change  change that refuses to let lobbyists drown out the voices of the american people  change that puts folks back to work  change that finally delivers on the promise of health care you can afford  and an energy policy that makes sense  change that leaves behind partisanship that stands in the way of progress  because we're all in this together as americans  this is our chance to build a new majority of democrats and independents and republicans who know that four more years of george bush just won't do  this is our moment to turn the page on the divisions and distractions that pass for politics in washington  so that we can write the next chapter in the history of american prosperity for all americans "], ["obama1", "earlier today  i went for a tour of the chrysler stamping plant in sterling heights  and i listened to folks tell me about how hard it is to get by in this economy  and the record oil prices mean that it's even harder for automakers and autoworkers   especially at a time when they're struggling to meet the demands of a  st century economy  since the beginning of this year  thousands of chrysler workers have lost their jobs  the entire industry has shed   jobs in the past eight years   about a third of which were lost in michigan  that's hundreds of thousands of workers who will no longer be able to count on a paycheck to pay the rising costs of health care and college  gas and groceries  and those who are lucky enough to avoid getting laid off are still feeling the pressures of restructuring  not too far from here  at american axle  uaw members have gone on strike to fight for good wages  and good benefits  and a decent standard of living  these are things that all hardworking families should expect and that uaw members deserve  and we stand in solidarity with the folks on the picket lines  and the families impacted by this strike  their struggle is part of a larger struggle that's being waged not just in michigan  but all across the country  it's a struggle to ensure that we have good manufacturing jobs so american workers can raise a family  have health care when they need it  put their children through college  and retire with dignity and security  they're common hopes  modest dreams  but they're slipping out of reach for too many families  now  a big part of the reason autoworkers are struggling on the factory floor is because of decisions that were made in the boardroom  rather than invest in the fuel efficient cars of the future  auto executives invested in the suvs and large trucks that may have helped meet a rising demand  but that essentially guaranteed that they would be outpaced by foreign competitors and that the industry's long term problems would be harder to solve  but american automakers have been showing leadership in recent years  ford has now tied toyota in the quality of the cars they're making  and they're spending more on r amp d  than nearly any other company in the world  chrysler is working to develop a system that integrates electric motors with a fixed gear transmission  and gm is releasing an average of one new hybrid model every three months for the next two years  so we're certainly taking steps in the right direction  but we must do more  and when i'm president  we will  we won't just support the autoworkers in michigan who built the auto industry  and keep it strong in good times and bad  and we won't just revive and strengthen our automakers  we'll revive and strengthen all of american manufacturing  these have been a disastrous eight years for our manufacturers  we've lost nearly   million good paying jobs  including hundreds of thousands in michigan  and more than   manufacturers have closed their doors  we can't afford to continue down this path  manufacturing supports one in six american jobs   jobs that pay more and offer better benefits than other jobs   and we all have a stake in saving them  it's time to recapture the spirit of innovation that has always fueled america's economic success  it's time we had an economy that was driven not just by foreign debt  but by the power of america's imagination  it's time to tap the ingenuity of engineers and entrepreneurs  policy experts and working folks to meet the challenges of our time  that's what this election is all about  so while this is a moment of challenge  it's also a moment of opportunity  and the question you'll face in november is which candidate can lead america to seize it  now  when john mccain came to michigan in january and said that we couldn't bring all these jobs back to america  he was right  but where he's wrong is in suggesting that there's nothing we can do to replace those jobs or create new ones  where he's wrong is in not offering new solutions or economic policies that are different from what george bush has given us for eight long years  that's wrong  that's giving up  and that's not what this country is about  i won't stand here and tell you that we'll be able to stop every job from going overseas or bring every job back  but i will tell you that we can end the bush mccain policy of giving tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas  and we can start giving those tax breaks to companies that create good paying jobs right here in america  instead of opposing job training similar to what's being offered at m tech  like john mccain has  we can make sure every american has the skills to compete in the global economy  we don't have to stand idly by while foreign competitors outpace us in making the cars of the future  i'm running for president to make sure that the cars of the future are made where they've always been made   right here in michigan  because the fight for american manufacturing is the fight for america's future   and i believe that's a fight this country will win  and so today  i'm announcing a manufacturing agenda that will lift up hardworking families  strengthen innovative companies  and foster our common prosperity  the first part of this agenda is investing in clean energy   because that isn't just how we'll get gas prices under control  combat climate change  and free ourselves from the tyranny of oil  it's also how we'll expand american manufacturing  create quality jobs  and grow our economy  that's why i'll invest   billion over the next ten years in the green energy sector  this will create up to five million new green jobs   and those are jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  and i'll be a president who finally keeps the promise that's made year after year after year by providing domestic automakers with the funding they need to retool their factories and make fuel efficient and alternative fuel cars  my own state of illinois is home to the oldest  continually operating ford assembly plant outside michigan  so i understand why it's so important to bring our auto industry into the  st century  and that's what we'll do when i'm president  here's what else we'll do  we'll invest   billion a year in creating a clean technologies deployment venture capital fund that will meet a critical need  today    of north america's automotive research is done right here in michigan  but too often  breakthrough technologies that are invented in america end up getting built overseas because of the cost of getting these new technologies commercialized  this government backed fund will help solve this problem by creating an initiative right here in michigan that will accelerate the development and deployment of cutting edge vehicle technologies  to take one example  this fund will help american companies build batteries for plug in hybrid vehicles so we don't have to buy them from abroad  that's how we'll make sure american automakers continue to lead the world  and that's how we'll make sure that american manufacturers don't just survive  but actually thrive in this century  the second part of my agenda is making sure that manufacturers are getting the support they need from washington  here in michigan  you've got the michigan  st century jobs fund  a state initiative to help businesses with the most innovative proposals create new products and jobs in this state  i believe that's an approach we need to replicate across the country  and that's what i'll do as president by creating an advanced manufacturing fund that will invest in innovation and job creation in places that have been hard hit by the decline in manufacturing  we'll also make the research and development tax credit permanent so we can encourage companies to do their research and create jobs right here in america  and we'll stop slashing funding for the manufacturing extension partnership  and start doubling it  this program helped create and protect over   jobs in   alone  and has been proven to increase the productivity of small and midsize manufacturers by up to   that's the kind of smart investment that will help us rebuild american manufacturing and make america more competitive  the third thing we'll do is invest in america's long term competitiveness by putting a college degree within reach for all americans and by helping community colleges like macomb develop associate degree programs in green technology to help make sure the next generation of workers have the skills they need to build the cars of the future  and we'll finally solve our health care crisis once and for all  this is a crisis that's not only leaving   million americans without health insurance and millions more struggling to pay rising costs  it's also hampering our economic competitiveness  we've all heard how health care accounts for about   of every car that's made in america  we have to change that  that's why unlike john mccain  i have a universal health care plan  it's a plan that will cut health care costs by up to   per family per year and reduce costs for business and their workers by picking up the tab for some of the most expensive illnesses and conditions  and we're not going to do it twenty years from now  or ten years from now   we're going to do it by the end of my first term as president of the united states  finally  if we want to fight for manufacturers here at home  we have to fight for them around the world  now  i believe in trade  but i also believe that for america to compete and win in the global economy  trade has to work for all americans  that means making sure that our workers are competing on a level playing field  and that countries like china aren't breaking the rules and putting american workers at a disadvantage  fighting for our workers isn't bad for business  it's good for our economy  and it's how we'll make sure that the costs and benefits of our global economy are being shared more fairly  so the american people will have a clear choice in november when i'm the nominee   it's a choice between more of the same failed bush policies that have done nothing but harm to american manufacturing over the last eight years  and real change that will help write a new chapter in the story of american manufacturing  for the sake of our families  our economy  and our leadership in the world  we have to renew the promise of american manufacturing "], ["obama1", "americans who work hard their entire lives have earned the right to retire with dignity and security  that's the promise that each of us wants to be realized within our own families  and it's a promise that we must keep for all american families  for generations  washington worked to protect that promise for working people  that's the promise that my grandparents knew  even though they came of age in the depression  my grandfather would go on to serve in patton's army  and my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line  when they set out west from kansas to build their lives after the war  they did so with the confidence that washington would help them reach a secure retirement  that was the promise that fdr made  and it was a promise that washington kept for decades while folks like my grandparents moved through the ups and downs of life in america's middle class  but today  washington is not working to preserve this fundamental part of the american dream a secure retirement is no longer a guarantee for the middle class  it's harder to save and harder to retire  pensions are getting crunched  the promise of social security may grow harder to keep  that's why i will fight every day to extend the promise of a retirement that is dignified and secure when i am president of the united states  it starts with protecting social security today  tomorrow  and forever  for millions of americans  social security is the difference between a comfortable retirement and the risk of poverty  we have an obligation to secure the future of one of the most successful programs in our history  that starts with talking straight to the american people about the challenges that lie ahead  social security is strong  but as more baby boomers retire  the long term cash flow needs to be addressed  we have to make sure social security is there for future generations  now we already know what the republicans will be running on  john mccain has already said that he supports private accounts for social security   in his words   along the lines that president bush proposed  let me be clear  privatizing social security was a bad idea when george w  bush proposed it  it's a bad idea today  it would cost a trillion dollars to implement at the front end  and would put the retirement plans of millions of americans at risk on a volatile wall street  that's why i stood up against this plan in the senate  and that's why i won't stand for it as president  but senator mccain's campaign went even further a few weeks ago  suggesting that the best answer to the growing pressures on social security might be to cut cost of living adjustments or to raise the retirement age  i think there is another option that is fairer to working men and women  we have to protect social security for future generations without pushing the burden on to seniors who have earned the right to retire in dignity  here's my plan  right now  the social security payroll tax only applies to the first   a worker makes  i think the best way forward is to adjust the cap on the payroll tax so that people like me pay a little bit more and people in need are protected  that way we can extend the promise of social security without shifting the burden on to seniors  and we should include what's called a  donut hole  to make sure that this change doesn't ensnare any middle class americans  but social security is not enough  more and more seniors are struggling with the cost of everything from gas to groceries  and we know that rising costs are hardest for folks on fixed incomes  that's why i'll make retirement more secure by eliminating income taxes for any retiree making less than   per year  this would completely eliminate income taxes for   million seniors  providing a savings of   per person each year  and it's time to end the outrage of ceos cashing out while workers lose their pensions  right now  bankruptcy laws are more focused on protecting banks than protecting pensions  that's not fair  that's not the america that i believe in  it's time to stop cutting back the safety net for working people while we protect golden parachutes for the well off  if you work hard and play by the rules  then you've earned your pension  if a company goes bankrupt  then workers need to be our top priority   not an afterthought  i fought against a bankruptcy bill in the senate that did more to protect credit card companies and banks than help working people  and as president  i'll limit circumstances when retirement benefits can be cut  and increase the wages and benefits that workers can claim in bankruptcy court  we'll require companies to disclose their pension fund investments  we'll put an end to the outrage of executives getting bonuses while workers watch pensions disappear  and we'll make sure that no american goes bankrupt just because they get sick  finally  we're not going to help folks reach retirement unless we encourage savings  but today  personal savings is at an all time low as americans are dealing with higher costs and a credit crunch  meanwhile    million working americans don't have employer based retirement plans  that's why i've proposed automatic workplace pensions  there will be no red tape or complicated forms   employers will provide a direct deposit of a small percentage of each paycheck into your account  you can add to it  or you can opt out at any time  and employers will have an easy opportunity to match employee savings  if you switch jobs  your savings will roll over into your new employer's system  if you become self employed  you will control your account  studies show that about   percent of americans will enroll if given the option to pursue my plan  this will put a secure retirement within reach for millions of working families  since the new deal  we've had that basic understanding in america  if you work hard and pay into the system  you've earned the right to a secure retirement  that's the promise that was kept for my grandparents and michelle's parents  and for so many families here in oregon and across the country  but in george bush and john mccain's washington  the message to the middle class is   you're on your own  well i'm running for because we must be the country where we say that we're all in this together  we can do this  we can come together to keep america's promise   not just for this generation of seniors  but for our children and our grandchildren  that's a principle worth fighting for  and with your help  that's what i will do every day when i am president of the united states of america "], ["obama1", "how's it going  iowa  it is good to be back in iowa  i love you back  iowa  first of all  let me say thank you to candy smeeter  ph  for the wonderful introduction and the unbelievable work that she did on behalf of our campaign  and still does  there are too many good friends and people who work tirelessly on my behalf to thank  you know who you are individually  i just want to say  first of all  thank you  to all of you  for the great work that you did in helping to kick off this campaign  and i do want to take a point of personal privilege and just say that i sure have a nice looking wife and kids  you know  there is a spirit that brought us here tonight   a spirit of change  and hope  and possibility  and there are few people in this country who embody that spirit more than our friend and our champion  senator edward kennedy  he has spent his life in service to this country not for the sake of glory or recognition  but because he cares   deeply  in his gut   about the causes of justice  and equality  and opportunity  so many of us here have benefited in some way or another because of the battles he's waged  and some of us are here because of them  we know he is not well right now  but we also know that he's a fighter  and as he takes on this fight  let us lift his spirits tonight by letting ted kennedy know that we are thinking of him  that we are praying for him  that we are standing with him  and that we will be fighting with him every step of the way  fifteen months ago  in the depths of winter  it was in this great state where we took the first steps of an unlikely journey to change america  the skeptics predicted we wouldn't get very far  the cynics dismissed us as a lot of hype and a little too much hope  and by the fall  the pundits in washington had all but counted us out  but the people of iowa had a different idea  from the very beginning  you knew that this journey wasn't about me or any of the other candidates in this race  it's about whether this country   at this defining moment   will continue down the same road that has failed us for so long  or whether we will seize this opportunity to take a different path   to forge a different future for the country we love  that is the question that sent thousands upon thousands of you to high school gyms and vfw halls  to backyards and front porches  to steak fries and jj dinners  where you spoke about what that future would look like  you spoke of an america where working families don't have to file for bankruptcy just because a child gets sick  where they don't lose their home because some predatory lender tricks them out of it  where they don't have to sit on the sidelines of the global economy because they couldn't afford the cost of a college education  you spoke of an america where our parents and grandparents don't spend their retirement in poverty because some ceo dumped their pension   an america where we don't just value wealth  but the work and the workers who create it  you spoke of an america where we don't send our sons and daughters on tour after tour of duty to a war that has cost us thousands of lives and billions of dollars but has not made us safer  you spoke of an america where we match the might of our military with the strength of our diplomacy and the power of our ideals   a nation that is still the beacon of all that is good and all that is possible for humankind  you spoke of a future where the politics we have in washington finally reflect the values we hold as americans   the values you live by here in iowa  common sense and honesty  generosity and compassion  decency and responsibility  these values don't belong to one class or one region or even one party   they are the values that bind us together as one country  that is the country i saw in the faces of crowds that would stretch far into the horizon of our heartland   faces of every color  of every age   faces i see here tonight  you are democrats who are tired of being divided  republicans who no longer recognize the party that runs washington  independents who are hungry for change  you are the young people who've been inspired for the very first time and those not so young folks who've been inspired for the first time in a long time  you are veterans and church goers  sportsmen and students  farmers and factory workers  teachers and business owners who have varied backgrounds and different traditions  but the same simple dreams for your children's future  many of you have been disappointed by politics and politicians more times than you can count  you've seen promises broken and good ideas drown in the sea of influence  and point scoring  and petty bickering that has consumed washington  and you've been told over and over and over again to be cynical  and doubtful  and even fearful about the possibility that things can ever be different  and yet  in spite of all the doubt and disappointment   or perhaps because of it   you came out on a cold winter's night in numbers that this country has never seen  and you stood for change  and because you did  a few more stood up  and then a few thousand stood up  and then a few million stood up  and tonight  in the fullness of spring  with the help of those who stood up from portland to louisville  we have returned to iowa with a majority of delegates elected by the american people  and you have put us within reach of the democratic nomination for president of the united states  the road here has been long  and that is partly because we've traveled it with one of the most formidable candidates to ever run for this office  in her thirty five years of public service  senator hillary rodham clinton has never given up on her fight for the american people  and tonight i congratulate her on her victory in kentucky  we have had our disagreements during this campaign  but we all admire her courage  her commitment and her perseverance  no matter how this primary ends  senator clinton has shattered myths and broken barriers and changed the america in which my daughters and yours will come of age  some may see the millions upon millions of votes cast for each of us as evidence that our party is divided  but i see it as proof that we have never been more energized and united in our desire to take this country in a new direction  more than anything  we need this unity and this energy in the months to come  because while our primary has been long and hard fought  the hardest and most important part of our journey still lies ahead  we face an opponent  john mccain  who arrived in washington nearly three decades ago as a vietnam war hero  and earned an admirable reputation for straight talk and occasional independence from his party  but this year's republican primary was a contest to see which candidate could out bush the other  and that is the contest john mccain won  the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest   of americans that once bothered senator mccain's conscience are now his only economic policy  the bush health care plan that only helps those who are already healthy and wealthy is now john mccain's answer to the   million americans without insurance and the millions more who can't pay their medical bills  the bush iraq policy that asks everything of our troops and nothing of iraqi politicians is john mccain's policy too  and so is the fear of tough and aggressive diplomacy that has left this country more isolated and less secure than at any time in recent history  the lobbyists who ruled george bush's washington are now running john mccain's campaign  and they actually had the nerve to say that the american people won't care about this  talk about out of touch  i will leave it up to senator mccain to explain to the american people whether his policies and positions represent long held convictions or washington calculations  but the one thing they don't represent is change  change is a tax code that rewards work instead of wealth by cutting taxes for middle class families  and senior citizens  and struggling homeowners  a tax code that rewards businesses that create good jobs here in america instead of the corporations that ship them overseas  that's what change is  change is a health care plan that guarantees insurance to every american who wants  that brings down premiums for every family who needs it  that stops insurance companies from discriminating and denying coverage to those who need it most  change is an energy policy that doesn't rely on buddying up to the saudi royal family and then begging them for oil   an energy policy that puts a price on pollution and makes the oil companies invest their record profits in clean  renewable sources of energy that will create five million new jobs and leave our children a safer planet  that's what change is  change is giving every child a world class education by recruiting an army of new teachers with better pay and more support  by promising four years of tuition to any american willing to serve their community and their country  by realizing that the best education starts with parents who turn off the tv  and take away the video games  and read to our children once in awhile  change is ending a war that we never should've started and finishing a war against al qaeda in afghanistan that we never should've ignored  change is facing the threats of the twenty first century not with bluster  or fear mongering  or tough talk  but with tough diplomacy  and strong alliances  and confidence in the ideals that have made this nation the last  best hope of earth  that is the legacy of roosevelt  and truman  and kennedy  that is what change is  that is the choice in this election  the same question that first led us to iowa fifteen months ago is the one that has brought us back here tonight  it is the one we will debate from washington to florida  from new hampshire to new mexico   the question of whether this country  at this moment  will keep doing what we've been doing for four more years  or whether we will take that different path  it is more of the same versus change  it is the past versus the future  it has been asked and answered by generations before us  and now it is our turn to choose  we will face our share of difficult and uncertain days in the journey ahead  the other side knows they have embraced yesterday's policies and so they will also embrace yesterday's tactics to try and change the subject  they will play on our fears and our doubts and our divisions to distract us from what matters to you and your future  well they can take the low road if they want  but it will not lead this country to a better place  and it will not work in this election  it won't work because you won't let it  not this time  not this year  my faith in the decency  and honesty  and generosity of the american people is not based on false hope or blind optimism  but on what i have lived and what i have seen in this very state  for in the darkest days of this campaign  when we were dismissed by all the polls and all the pundits  i would come to iowa and see that there was something happening here that the world did not yet understand  it's what led high school and college students to give up their vacations to stuff envelopes and knock on doors  and why grandparents have spent all their afternoons making phone calls to perfect strangers  it's what led men and women who can barely pay the bills to dig into their savings and write five dollar checks and ten dollar checks  and why young people from all over this country have left their friends and their families for a job that offers little pay and less sleep  change is coming to america  it's the spirit that sent the first patriots to lexington and concord and led the defenders of freedom to light the way north on an underground railroad  it's what sent my grandfather's generation to beachheads in normandy  and women to seneca falls  and workers to picket lines and factory fences  it's what led all those young men and women who saw beatings and billy clubs on their television screens to leave their homes  and get on buses  and march through the streets of selma and montgomery   black and white  rich and poor  change is coming to america  it's what i saw all those years ago on the streets of chicago when i worked as an organizer   that in the face of joblessness  and hopelessness  and despair  a better day is still possible if there are people willing to work for it  and fight for it  and believe in it  that's what i've seen here in iowa  that's what is happening in america   our journey may be long  our work will be great  but we know in our hearts we are ready for change  we are ready to come together  and in this election  we are ready to believe again  thank you iowa  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "it is my privilege to join in this week's independence day celebration  and in honoring those who have stood up with courage and conviction for cuban liberty  i'm going to take this opportunity to speak about cuba  and also u s  policy toward the americas more broadly  we meet here united in our unshakeable commitment to freedom  and it is fitting that we reaffirm that commitment here in miami  in many ways  miami stands as a symbol of hope for what's possible in the americas  miami's promise of liberty and opportunity has drawn generations of immigrants to these shores  sometimes with nothing more than the clothes on their back  it was a similar hope that drew my own father across an ocean  in search of the same promise that our dreams need not be deferred because of who we are  what we look like  or where we come from  here  in miami  that promise can join people together  we take common pride in a vibrant and diverse democracy  and a hard earned prosperity  we find common pleasure in the crack of the bat  in the rhythms of our music  and the ease of voices shifting from spanish or creole or portuguese to english  these bonds are built on a foundation of shared history in our hemisphere  colonized by empires  we share stories of liberation  confronted by our own imperfections  we are joined in a desire to build a more perfect union  rich in resources  we have yet to vanquish poverty  what all of us strive for is freedom as fdr described it  political freedom  religious freedom  but also freedom from want  and freedom from fear  at our best  the united states has been a force for these four freedoms in the americas  but if we're honest with ourselves  we'll acknowledge that at times we've failed to engage the people of the region with the respect owed to a partner  when george bush was elected  he held out the promise that this would change  he raised the hopes of the region that our engagement would be sustained instead of piecemeal  he called mexico our most important bilateral relationship  and pledged to make latin america a  fundamental commitment  of his presidency  it seemed that a new  st century era had dawned  almost eight years later  those high hopes have been dashed  since the bush administration launched a misguided war in iraq  its policy in the americas has been negligent toward our friends  ineffective with our adversaries  disinterested in the challenges that matter in peoples' lives  and incapable of advancing our interests in the region  no wonder  then  that demagogues like hugo chavez have stepped into this vacuum  his predictable yet perilous mix of anti american rhetoric  authoritarian government  and checkbook diplomacy offers the same false promise as the tried and failed ideologies of the past  but the united states is so alienated from the rest of the americas that this stale vision has gone unchallenged  and has even made inroads from bolivia to nicaragua  and chavez and his allies are not the only ones filling the vacuum  while the united states fails to address the changing realities in the americas  others from europe and asia   notably china   have stepped up their own engagement  iran has drawn closer to venezuela  and just the other day tehran and caracas launched a joint bank with their windfall oil profits  that is the record   the bush record in latin america   that john mccain has chosen to embrace  senator mccain doesn't talk about these trends in our hemisphere because he knows that it's part of the broader bush mccain failure to address priorities beyond iraq  the situation has changed in the americas  but we've failed to change with it  instead of engaging the people of the region  we've acted as if we can still dictate terms unilaterally  we have not offered a clear and comprehensive vision  backed up with strong diplomacy  we are failing to join the battle for hearts and minds  for far too long  washington has engaged in outdated debates and stuck to tired blueprints on drugs and trade  on democracy and development   even though they won't meet the tests of the future  the stakes could not be higher  it is time for us to recognize that the future security and prosperity of the united states is fundamentally tied to the future of the americas  if we don't turn away from the policies of the past  then we won't be able to shape the future  the bush administration has offered no clear vision for this future  and neither has john mccain  so we face a clear choice in this election  we can continue as a bystander  or we can lead the hemisphere into the  st century  and when i am president of the united states  we will choose to lead  it's time for a new alliance of the americas  after eight years of the failed policies of the past  we need new leadership for the future  after decades pressing for top down reform  we need an agenda that advances democracy  security  and opportunity from the bottom up  so my policy towards the americas will be guided by the simple principle that what's good for the people of the americas is good for the united states  that means measuring success not just through agreements among governments  but also through the hopes of the child in the favelas of rio  the security for the policeman in mexico city  and the answered cries of political prisoners heard from jails in havana  the first and most fundamental freedom that we must work for is political freedom  the united states must be a relentless advocate for democracy  i grew up for a time in indonesia  it was a society struggling to achieve meaningful democracy  power could be undisguised and indiscriminate  too often  power wore a uniform  and was unaccountable to the people  some still had good reason to fear a knock on the door  there is no place for this kind of tyranny in this hemisphere  there is no place for any darkness that would shut out the light of liberty  here we must heed the words of dr  king  written from his own jail cell   injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere  throughout my entire life  there has been injustice in cuba  never  in my lifetime  have the people of cuba known freedom  never  in the lives of two generations of cubans  have the people of cuba known democracy  this is the terrible and tragic status quo that we have known for half a century   of elections that are anything but free or fair  of dissidents locked away in dark prison cells for the crime of speaking the truth  i won't stand for this injustice  you won't stand for this injustice  and together we will stand up for freedom in cuba  now i know what the easy thing is to do for american politicians  every four years  they come down to miami  they talk tough  they go back to washington  and nothing changes in cuba  that's what john mccain did the other day  he joined the parade of politicians who make the same empty promises year after year  decade after decade  instead of offering a strategy for change  he chose to distort my position  embrace george bush's  and continue a policy that's done nothing to advance freedom for the cuban people  that's the political posture that john mccain has chosen  and all it shows is that you can't take his so called straight talk seriously  my policy toward cuba will be guided by one word  libertad  and the road to freedom for all cubans must begin with justice for cuba's political prisoners  the rights of free speech  a free press and freedom of assembly  and it must lead to elections that are free and fair  now let me be clear  john mccain's been going around the country talking about how much i want to meet with raul castro  as if i'm looking for a social gathering  that's never what i've said  and john mccain knows it  after eight years of the disastrous policies of george bush  it is time to pursue direct diplomacy  with friend and foe alike  without preconditions  there will be careful preparation  we will set a clear agenda  and as president  i would be willing to lead that diplomacy at a time and place of my choosing  but only when we have an opportunity to advance the interests of the united states  and to advance the cause of freedom for the cuban people  i will never  ever  compromise the cause of liberty  and unlike john mccain  i would never  ever  rule out a course of action that could advance the cause of liberty  we've heard enough empty promises from politicians like george bush and john mccain  i will turn the page  it's time for more than tough talk that never yields results  it's time for a new strategy  there are no better ambassadors for freedom than cuban americans  that's why i will immediately allow unlimited family travel and remittances to the island  it's time to let cuban americans see their mothers and fathers  their sisters and brothers  it's time to let cuban american money make their families less dependent upon the castro regime  i will maintain the embargo  it provides us with the leverage to present the regime with a clear choice  if you take significant steps toward democracy  beginning with the freeing of all political prisoners  we will take steps to begin normalizing relations  that's the way to bring about real change in cuba   through strong  smart and principled diplomacy  and we know that freedom across our hemisphere must go beyond elections  in venezuela  hugo chavez is a democratically elected leader  but we also know that he does not govern democratically  he talks of the people  but his actions just serve his own power  yet the bush administration's blustery condemnations and clumsy attempts to undermine chavez have only strengthened his hand  we've heard plenty of talk about democracy from george bush  but we need steady action  we must put forward a vision of democracy that goes beyond the ballot box  we should increase our support for strong legislatures  independent judiciaries  free press  vibrant civil society  honest police forces  religious freedom  and the rule of law  that is how we can support democracy that is strong and sustainable not just on an election day  but in the day to day lives of the people of the americas  that is what is so badly needed   not just in cuba and venezuela   but just to our southeast in haiti as well  the haitian people have suffered too long under governments that cared more about their own power than their peoples' progress and prosperity  it's time to press haiti's leaders to bridge the divides between them  and it's time to invest in the economic development that must underpin the security that the haitian people lack  and that is why the second part of my agenda will be advancing freedom from fear in the americas  for too many people in our hemisphere  security is absent from their daily lives  and for far too long  washington has been trapped in a conventional thinking about latin america and the caribbean  from the right  we hear about violent insurgents  from the left  we hear about paramilitaries  this is the predictable debate that seems frozen in time from the  s  you're either soft on communism or soft on death squads  and it has more to do with the politics of washington than beating back the perils that so many people face in the americas  the person living in fear of violence doesn't care if they're threatened by a right wing paramilitary or a left wing terrorist  they don't care if they're being threatened by a drug cartel or a corrupt police force  they just care that they're being threatened  and that their families can't live and work in peace  that is why there will never be true security unless we focus our efforts on targeting every source of fear in the americas  that's what i'll do as president of the united states  for the people of colombia   who have suffered at the hands of killers of every sort   that means battling all sources of violence  when i am president  we will continue the andean counter drug program  and update it to meet evolving challenges  we will fully support colombia's fight against the farc  we'll work with the government to end the reign of terror from right wing paramilitaries  we will support colombia's right to strike terrorists who seek safe haven across its borders  and we will shine a light on any support for the farc that comes from neighboring governments  this behavior must be exposed to international condemnation  regional isolation  and   if need be   strong sanctions  it must not stand  we must also make clear our support for labor rights  and human rights  and that means meaningful support for colombia's democratic institutions  we've neglected this support   especially for the rule of law   for far too long  in every country in our hemisphere   including our own   governments must develop the tools to protect their people  because if we've learned anything in our history in the americas  it's that true security cannot come from force alone  not as long as there are towns in mexico where drug kingpins are more powerful than judges  not as long as there are children who grow up afraid of the police  not as long as drugs and gangs move north across our border  while guns and cash move south in return  this nexus is a danger to every country in the region   including our own  thousands of central american gang members have been arrested across the united states  including here in south florida  there are national emergencies facing guatemala  el salvador  and honduras  mexican drug cartels are terrorizing cities and towns  president calderon was right to say that enough is enough  we must support mexico's effort to crack down  but we must stand for more than force   we must support the rule of law from the bottom up  that means more investments in prevention and prosecutors  in community policing and an independent judiciary  i agree with my friend  senator dick lugar   the merida initiative does not invest enough in central america  where much of the trafficking and gang activity begins  and we must press further south as well  it's time to work together to find the best practices that work across the hemisphere  and to tailor approaches to fit each country  that's why i will direct my attorney general and secretary of homeland security to sit down with all their counterparts in the americas during my first year in office  we'll strive for unity of effort  we'll provide the resources  and ask that every country do the same  and we'll tie our support to clear benchmarks for drug seizures  corruption prosecutions  crime reduction  and kingpins busted  we have to do our part  and that is why a core part of this effort will be a northbound southbound strategy  we need tougher border security  and a renewed focus on busting up gangs and traffickers crossing our border  but we must address the material heading south as well  as president  i'll make it clear that we're coming after the guns  we're coming after the money laundering  and we're coming after the vehicles that enable this crime  and we'll crack down on the demand for drugs in our own communities  and restore funding for drug task forces and the cops program  we must win the fights on our own streets if we're going to secure the region  the third part of my agenda is advancing freedom from want  because there is much that we can do to advance opportunity for the people of the americas  that begins with understanding what's changed in latin america  and what hasn't  enormous wealth has been created  and financial markets are far stronger than a decade ago  brazil's economy has grown by leaps and bounds  and perhaps the second richest person in the world is a mexican  yet while there has been great economic progress  there is still back breaking inequality  despite a growing middle class    million people live on less than two dollars a day  and   percent of latin americans live in poverty  this feeds everything from drugs  to migration  to support for leaders that appeal to the poor without delivering on their promises  that is why the united states must stand for growth in the americas from the bottom up  that begins at home  with comprehensive immigration reform  that means securing our border and passing tough employer enforcement laws  it means bringing   million unauthorized immigrants out of the shadows  but it also means working with mexico  central america and others to support bottom up development to our south  for two hundred years  the united states has made it clear that we won't stand for foreign intervention in our hemisphere  but every day  all across the americas  there is a different kind of struggle   not against foreign armies  but against the deadly threat of hunger and thirst  disease and despair  that is not a future that we have to accept   not for the child in port au prince or the family in the highlands of peru  we can do better  we must do better  we cannot ignore suffering to our south  nor stand for the globalization of the empty stomach  responsibility rests with governments in the region  but we must do our part  i will substantially increase our aid to the americas  and embrace the millennium development goals of halving global poverty by   we'll target support to bottom up growth through micro financing  vocational training  and small enterprise development  it's time for the united states to once again be a beacon of hope and a helping hand  trade must be part of this solution  but i strongly reject the bush mccain view that any trade deal is a good deal  we cannot accept trade that enriches those at the top of the ladder while cutting out the rungs at the bottom  it's time to understand that the goal of our trade policy must be trade that works for all people in all countries  like central america's bishops  i opposed cafta because the needs of workers were not adequately addressed  i supported the peru free trade agreement because there were binding labor and environmental provisions  that's the kind of trade we need   trade that lifts up workers  not just a corporate bottom line  there's nothing protectionist about demanding that trade spreads the benefits of globalization  instead of steering them to special interests while we short change workers at home and abroad  if john mccain believes   as he said the other day   that   percent of americans think we're on the wrong track because we haven't passed free trade with colombia  then he's totally out of touch with the american people  and if john mccain thinks that we can paper over our failure of leadership in the region by occasionally passing trade deals with friendly governments  then he's out of touch with the people of the americas  and we have to look for ways to grow our economies and deepen integration beyond trade deals  that's what china is doing right now  as they build bridges from beijing to brazil  and expand their investments across the region  if the united states does not step forward  we risk being left behind  and that is why we must seize a unique opportunity to lead the region toward a more secure and sustainable energy future  all of us feel the impact of the global energy crisis  in the short term  it means an ever more expensive addiction to oil  which bankrolls petro powered authoritarianism around the globe  and drives up the cost of everything from a tank of gas to dinner on the table  and in the long term  few regions are more imperiled by the stronger storms  higher floodwaters  and devastating droughts that could come with global warming  whole crops could disappear  putting the food supply at risk for hundreds of millions  while we share this risk  we also share the resources to do something about it  that's why i'll bring together the countries of the region in a new energy partnership for the americas  we need to go beyond bilateral agreements  we need a regional approach  together  we can forge a path toward sustainable growth and clean energy  leadership must begin at home  that's why i've proposed a cap and trade system to limit our carbon emissions and to invest in alternative sources of energy  we'll allow industrial emitters to offset a portion of this cost by investing in low carbon energy projects in latin america and the caribbean  and we'll increase research and development across the americas in clean coal technology  in the next generation of sustainable biofuels not taken from food crops  and in wind and solar energy  we'll enlist the world bank  the organization of american states  and the inter american development bank to support these investments  and ensure that these projects enhance natural resources like land  wildlife  and rain forests  we'll finally enforce environmental standards in our trade deals  we'll establish a program for the department of energy and our laboratories to share technology with countries across the region  we'll assess the opportunities and risks of nuclear power in the hemisphere by sitting down with mexico  brazil  argentina and chile  and we'll call on the american people to join this effort through an energy corps of engineers and scientists who will go abroad to help develop clean energy solutions  this is the unique role that the united states can play  we can offer more than the tyranny of oil  we can learn from the progress made in a country like brazil  while making the americas a model for the world  we can offer leadership that serves the common prosperity and common security of the entire region  this is the promise of fdr's four freedoms that we must realize  but only if we recognize that in the  st century  we cannot treat latin america and the caribbean as a junior partner  just as our neighbors to the south should reject the bombast of authoritarian bullies  an alliance of the americas will only succeed if it is founded on a bedrock of mutual respect  it's time to turn the page on the arrogance in washington and the anti americanism across the region that stands in the way of progress  it's time to listen to one another and to learn from one another  to fulfill this promise  my administration won't wait six years to proclaim a  year of engagement  we will pursue aggressive  principled  and sustained diplomacy in the americas from day one  i will reinstate a special envoy for the americas in my white house who will work with my full support  but we'll also expand the foreign service  and open more consulates in the neglected regions of the americas  we'll expand the peace corps  and ask more young americans to go abroad to deepen the trust and the ties among our people  and we must tap the vast resource of our own immigrant population to advance each part of our agenda  one of the troubling aspects of our recent politics has been the anti immigrant sentiment that has flared up  and been exploited by politicians come election time  we need to understand that immigration   when done legally   is a source of strength for this country  our diversity is a source of strength for this country  when we join together   black  white  hispanic  asian  and native american   there is nothing that we can't accomplish  todos somos americanos  together  we can choose the future over the past  at a time when our leadership has suffered  i have no doubts about whether we can succeed  if the united states makes its case  if we meet those who doubt us or deride us head on  if we draw on our best tradition of standing up for those four freedoms   then we can shape our future instead of being shaped by it  we can renew our leadership in the hemisphere  we can win the support not just of governments  but of the people of the americas  but only if we leave the bluster behind  only if we are strong and steadfast  confident and consistent  jose marti once wrote   it is not enough to come to the defense of freedom with epic and intermittent efforts when it is threatened at moments that appear critical  every moment is critical for the defense of freedom  every moment is critical  and this must be our moment  freedom  opportunity  dignity  these are not just the values of the united states   they are the values of the americas  they were the cause of washington's infantry and bolivar's cavalry  of marti's pen and hidalgo's church bells  that legacy is our inheritance  that must be our cause  and now must be the time that we turn the page to a new chapter in the story of the americas "], ["obama1", "on this memorial day  as our nation honors its unbroken line of fallen heroes  our sense of patriotism is particularly strong  because while we gather here under open skies  we know that far beyond the organ mountains   in the streets of baghdad  and the outskirts of kabul   america's sons and daughters are sacrificing on our behalf  and our thoughts and prayers are with them  i speak to you today with deep humility  my grandfather marched in patton's army  but i cannot know what it is to walk into battle like so many of you  my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line  but i cannot know what it is for a family to sacrifice like so many of yours have  i am the father of two young girls  and i cannot imagine what it is to lose a child  my heart breaks for the families who've lost a loved one  these are things i cannot know  but there are also some things i do know  i know that our sadness today is mixed with pride  that those we've lost will be remembered by a grateful nation  and that our presence here today is only possible because your loved ones  america's patriots  were willing to give their lives to defend our nation  i know that while we may come from different places  cherish different traditions  and have different political beliefs  we all   every one of us   hold in reverence those who've given this country the full measure of their devotion  and i know that children in new mexico and across this country look to your children  to your brothers and sisters  mothers and fathers  and friends   to those we honor today   as a shining example of what's best about america  their lives are a model for us all  what led these men and women to wear their country's uniform  what is it that leads anyone to put aside their own pursuit of life's comforts  to subordinate their own sense of survival  for something bigger   something greater  many of those we honor today were so young when they were killed  they had a whole life ahead of them   birthdays and weddings  holidays with children and grandchildren  homes and jobs and happiness of their own  and yet  at one moment or another  they felt the tug  just as generations of americans did before them  maybe it was a massacre in a boston square  or a president's call to save the union and free the slaves  maybe it was the day of infamy that awakened a nation to a storm in the pacific and a madman's death march across europe  or maybe it was the morning they woke up to see our walls of security crumble along with our two largest towers  whatever the moment was  when it came and they felt that tug  perhaps it was simply the thought of a mom or a dad  a husband or a wife  or a child not yet born that made this young american think that it was time to go  that made them think  i must serve so that the people i love can live   in happiness  and safety  and freedom  this sense of service is what america is all about  it is what leads americans to enter the military  it is what sustains them in the most difficult hours  and it is the safeguard of our security  you see  america has the greatest military in the history of the world  we have the best training  the most advanced technology  the most sophisticated planning  and the most powerful weapons  and yet  in the end  though each of these things is absolutely critical  the true strength of our military lies someplace else  it lies in the spirit of america's servicemen and women  no matter whether they faced down fascism or fought for freedom in korea and vietnam  liberated kuwait or stopped ethnic cleansing in the balkans or serve brilliantly and bravely under our flag today  no matter whether they are black  white  latino  asian  or native american  whether they come from old military families  or are recent immigrants   their stories tell the same truth  it is not simply their bravery  their insistence on doing their part   whatever the cost   to make america more secure and our world more free  it's not simply an unflinching belief in our highest ideals  it's that in the thick of battle  when their very survival is threatened  america's sons and daughters aren't thinking about themselves  they're thinking about one another  they're risking everything to save not their own lives  but the lives of their fellow soldiers and sailors  airmen and marines  and when we lose them   in a final act of selflessness and service   we know that they died so that their brothers and sisters  so that our nation  might live  what makes america's servicemen and women heroes is not just their sense of duty  honor  and country  it's the bigness of their hearts and the breadth of their compassion  that is what we honor today  oliver wendell holmes once remarked that  to fight out a war  you must believe something and want something with all your might  the americans we honor today believed  sergeant ryan jopek believed  ryan was just weeks away from coming home when he volunteered for a mission to mosul from which he would never return  his friends remember his easy smile  i remember ryan because of the bracelet his mother gave me that i wear every day  next to his name  it reads   all gave some   he gave all  it is a living reminder of our obligation as americans to serve ryan as well as he served us  as well as the wounded warriors i've had the honor of meeting at walter reed have served us  as well as the soldiers at fort bliss and the troops in iraq  afghanistan  and around the world are serving us  that means giving the same priority to building a  st century va as to building a  st century military  it means having zero tolerance for veterans sleeping on our streets  it means bringing home our pows and mias  and it means treating the graves of veterans like the hallowed ground it is and banning protests near funerals  but it also means something more  it means understanding that what ryan and so many americans fought and died for is not a place on a map or a certain kind of people  what they sacrificed for   what they gave all for   is a larger idea   the idea that a nation can be governed by laws  not men  that we can be equal in the eyes of those laws  that we can be free to say what we want  write what we want  and worship as we please  that we can have the right to pursue our own dreams  but the obligation to help our fellow americans pursue theirs  so on this day  of all days  let's memorialize our fallen heroes by honoring all who wear our country's uniform  and by completing their work to make america more secure and our world more free  but let's also do our part   service member and civilian alike   to live up to the idea that so many of our fellow citizens have consecrated   the idea of america  that is the essence of patriotism  that is the lesson of this solemn day  and that is the task that lies ahead  may god bless you  and may god bless the united states of america "], ["obama1", "i just had the privilege of visiting with felicitas rosel and francisco cano at their home here in las vegas  today  john mccain is having a different kind of meeting  he's holding a fundraiser with george bush behind closed doors in arizona  no cameras  no reporters  and we all know why  senator mccain doesn't want to be seen  hat in hand  with the president whose failed policies he promises to continue for another four years  but the question for the american people is  do  u we u  want to continue george bush's policies  because i don't think the american people want to continue the disastrous economic policies that have helped create catastrophes like the housing crisis that we're here to discuss today  i don't think we want to continue a misguided foreign policy and an endless war in iraq that has cost us thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars while making us less safe and less secure  that's the choice in this election  on issue after issue  john mccain is offering more of the same policies that have failed for the last eight years  that's the agenda that he and the president are raising money to support later today  but i'm here in nevada because we know it's time to turn the page  here  in nevada  we see how so many people are fighting for their american dream  because in so many ways  felicitas and francisco have lived the american dream  their story is not one of great wealth or privilege  instead  it embodies the steady pursuit of simple dreams that has built this country from the bottom up  felicitas came to las vegas from arizona  francisco came from mexico  and together  in this city of dreams  they built a life founded on hard work and family  patience and perseverance  for two decades  they raised four daughters on a modest but dependable wage   thanks in part to their ability to organize with other workers in the culinary union  today  she works as a maid  and he works as a porter   in the bellagio  down on the strip  like so many working people  their lives have been shaped by sacrifice for their children's future   the promise that each generation has the ability to reach a little further  and theirs have been lives lived rent check to rent check  with the promise of a home sought through the little savings that they could put aside week after week  month after month  year after year  finally  three years ago  they were able to reach that destination in their pursuit of the american dream  after so much hard work  felicitas and francisco were able to move into a home of their own  yet a predatory loan has turned this source of stability into an anchor of insecurity  because a lender went for the easy buck  they are left struggling with ballooning interest rates and monthly mortgage payments  because washington has failed working people in this country  they are facing foreclosure  and the american dream they sought for decades risks slipping away  sadly   shamefully   their story is one that is found across the united states  over two million families are facing foreclosure  here in nevada  the foreclosure rate is over three and a half times the national average  here in las vegas  one out of every   households is facing foreclosure  as so many americans walk away from their homes  millions more have seen their home values plunge  which only puts our economy into a deeper hole  the foreclosure crisis has played out in painfully steady but predictable motion  while lenders were taking advantage of folks like felicitas and francisco  they were also spending hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying washington to stay on the sidelines  for president bush  the answer was to do nothing until the pain out on main street trickled up to wall street  then  a few months ago  he rolled out a plan that was too little  too late  instead of offering meaningful relief  he warned against doing too much  his main proposal for an economy that is leaving working people behind is to give more tax cuts to the wealthiest americans  even though they don't need them and didn't ask for them  now i know that john mccain doesn't like to talk about the economy  earlier in the campaign  he admitted that   the issue of economics is not something i've understood as well as i should  apparently  that hasn't changed  since his plan amounts to little more than borrowing bad ideas from george bush  for months  john mccain struggled to come up with a real plan to address the housing crisis  even as millions of americans faced the nightmare of not being able to pay next month's bills  it took him three tries to come up with answers for struggling homeowners  and he still came up short  and senator mccain is so out of touch with the struggles of working people that he gave a speech laying out his economic agenda last week  and he couldn't even be bothered to talk about a foreclosure crisis that has put so many families on the brink of catastrophe  and put our economy on the brink of a recession  we've had enough of the can't do  won't do  won't even try approach from george bush and john mccain  we can't afford another president who can't be bothered to stand up for working people  it's time for change  it's time that washington went to work for working people  to stabilize our housing market and to bring this crisis to an end  i'm a strong supporter of chris dodd and barney frank's proposal to create a new fha housing security program  this will provide meaningful incentives for lenders to buy or refinance existing mortgages  and to convert them into stable  year fixed mortgages  this is not a windfall for borrowers   as they have to share any capital gain  it's not a bailout for lenders or investors who gambled recklessly   as they will take losses  it asks both sides to sacrifice  it offers a responsible and fair way to help americans who are facing foreclosure to keep their homes at rates they can afford  the president has threatened to veto this approach  well it's time to stand up to george bush  and to tell him to stop standing in the way of meaningful relief for working people  congress must pass this bill  the president should sign it  and the fha must get to work implementing it this fall  we cannot wait any longer   it's time for washington to finally start to act  for homeowners who were victims of fraud  i've also proposed an immediate   billion foreclosure prevention fund  if the government can bail out investment banks on wall street  then we can extend a hand to folks who are struggling on main street  this fund will help homeowners sell a home that is beyond their means  or modify their loan to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy  and it's long past time to amend bankruptcy laws that were written to protect banks and lenders instead of working people  families should not be forced to stick to the terms of a home loan that was predatory or unfair  it's time to close a loophole that protects special interests while punishing working people  and as president  i'll get tough on enforcement  raise the penalties on lenders who break the rules  and implement a new home score system that will allow consumers to find out more about mortgage offers and whether they'll be able to make payments  we need a housing market that is open and honest  we need to make sure that homebuyers have access to accurate and complete information about their mortgage options  finally  we need a tax code that's fair  john mccain is running for a third term of tax cuts that only shift the burden onto working people  that might make sense to the washington lobbyists who run john mccain's campaign  but it won't do anything to help families who are struggling  that's why i'm going to give a tax cut to working people  we'll give homeowners a tax credit that covers   percent of a family's mortgage interest payment  we'll eliminate income taxes for seniors making under   a year  and we'll extend a  making work pay  tax credit of up to   for american workers  and   for working families  that's the kind of tax cut that makes sense for working people  for far too long  our policies have been measured by how much sense they made on wall street or to the washington lobbyists on k street  this election must be our time to stand up and say that those aren't the american values that we believe in  we believe in an honest day's pay for an honest day's work  we believe in an america that welcomes hard working immigrants like francisco  we believe in an america where you can leave your children with a little more opportunity than you had  where you aren't turned out of your home because a mortgage lender went for the easy buck  i do not accept an america where washington's only message to working people is   you're on your own  we're here to once again reaffirm that fundamental american belief   that we're all in this together as americans  because the dreams of hard working people like felicitas and francisco matter to us  their struggle is our struggle  their dreams are our dreams   that's why we call it  the american dream  and that's what i'll work for  and fight for  every day as president of the united states "], ["obama1", "wherever i go  i talk about how we need to bring about real change in this country  and few understand the need for change as well as folks here in michigan  because while we've been talking about a recession in this country for a few months now  michigan has been living it for a very long time  michigan has the highest unemployment rate in the nation and workers and communities across this state have been struggling for years with the downturn that all of america is feeling today  in fairness  some of these challenges are the product of larger forces beyond the control of government  but there is no doubt that the bush economic policies have done little to help the working families of michigan or build a better future for america  that is  in large part  what this election in november will be all about  because senator mccain says we have made  and this is a quote   great progress economically  these past eight year  and he promises more of the same  well  i couldn't disagree more  since george bush took office  we've gone through the first period of sustained economic growth since world war ii in which the incomes of american workers have actually dropped    million more americans don't have health care    million more americans are out of work  millions of families are facing foreclosure  you're working harder for less  and paying more for tuition  more for groceries  and more at the pump  to me  this isn't  great progress  this is a cause for concern and an impetus for change  yet senator mccain wants to double down on the bush economic plan  rather than reforming an unfair tax system and offering the middle class some relief  he's offering more tax loopholes for corporations and the wealthy we just can't afford  rather than making health care affordable for every american  like i've proposed  he's offering a health care plan that puts coverage at risk and that's designed for folks who are already healthy and able to afford health care at any price  and rather than standing up for robust trade that works for all americans  as i do  he's supporting more trade deals that work for wall street  but not for main street  but understand  there's a reason the problems we face today are so much bigger than they were several years ago  a big part of it is that george bush and john mccain have been so focused on pursuing a flawed and costly war in iraq that they've lost sight of our mounting problems here at home  instead of working to fix our economy and lift up hardworking families  they've fought to extend a war that's costing thousands of lives and billions of dollars without making us any safer   a war that has strengthened our enemies and distracted us from the real battle with osama bin ladin in afghanistan and pakistan  just to put this in perspective  for what taxpayers here in oakland county have spent in iraq  you could be providing health care for nearly   people  or offering more than   college scholarships for michigan students  or hiring more than   elementary school teachers  and now it seems like all senator mccain is talking about on the campaign trail is iraq   instead of offering real solutions to the problems you face every day  in fact  senator mccain conceded not long ago that he didn't know much about the economy  that's not his interest  that's not his priority  but it will be mine  i want to end a war that's costing america   billion a month and begin to make the critical investments we need to get our own country moving again  that's the choice in this election  are we going to continue the failed bush mccain economic policies and remain mired in an endless and costly conflict in iraq  or will we change course  and focus on the problems that working families in michigan and across america are facing every day  i believe strongly that we are on the wrong path  and that we need new priorities and a new direction and that is why i'm running for president or the united states "], ["obama1", "tonight  after fifty four hard fought contests  our primary season has finally come to an end  sixteen months have passed since we first stood together on the steps of the old state capitol in springfield  illinois  thousands of miles have been traveled  millions of voices have been heard  and because of what you said   because you decided that change must come to washington  because you believed that this year must be different than all the rest  because you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations  tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another   a journey that will bring a new and better day to america  tonight  i can stand before you and say that i will be the democratic nominee for president of the united states  i want to thank every american who stood with us over the course of this campaign   through the good days and the bad  from the snows of cedar rapids to the sunshine of sioux falls  and tonight i also want to thank the men and woman who took this journey with me as fellow candidates for president  at this defining moment for our nation  we should be proud that our party put forth one of the most talented  qualified field of individuals ever to run for this office  i have not just competed with them as rivals  i have learned from them as friends  as public servants  and as patriots who love america and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better  they are leaders of this party  and leaders that america will turn to for years to come  that is particularly true for the candidate who has traveled further on this journey than anyone else  senator hillary clinton has made history in this campaign not just because she's a woman who has done what no woman has done before  but because she's a leader who inspires millions of americans with her strength  her courage  and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight  we've certainly had our differences over the last sixteen months  but as someone who's shared a stage with her many times  i can tell you that what gets hillary clinton up in the morning   even in the face of tough odds   is exactly what sent her and bill clinton to sign up for their first campaign in texas all those years ago  what sent her to work at the children's defense fund and made her fight for health care as first lady  what led her to the united states senate and fueled her barrier breaking campaign for the presidency   an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary americans  no matter how difficult the fight may be  and you can rest assured that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country  she will be central to that victory  when we transform our energy policy and lift our children out of poverty  it will be because she worked to help make it happen  our party and our country are better off because of her  and i am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with hillary rodham clinton  there are those who say that this primary has somehow left us weaker and more divided  well i say that because of this primary  there are millions of americans who have cast their ballot for the very first time  there are independents and republicans who understand that this election isn't just about the party in charge of washington  it's about the need to change washington  there are young people  and african americans  and latinos  and women of all ages who have voted in numbers that have broken records and inspired a nation  all of you chose to support a candidate you believe in deeply  but at the end of the day  we aren't the reason you came out and waited in lines that stretched block after block to make your voice heard  you didn't do that because of me or senator clinton or anyone else  you did it because you know in your hearts that at this moment   a moment that will define a generation   we cannot afford to keep doing what we've been doing  we owe our children a better future  we owe our country a better future  and for all those who dream of that future tonight  i say   let us begin the work together  let us unite in common effort to chart a new course for america  in just a few short months  the republican party will arrive in st  paul with a very different agenda  they will come here to nominate john mccain  a man who has served this country heroically  i honor that service  and i respect his many accomplishments  even if he chooses to deny mine  my differences with him are not personal  they are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign  because while john mccain can legitimately tout moments of independence from his party in the past  such independence has not been the hallmark of his presidential campaign  it's not change when john mccain decided to stand with george bush ninety five percent of the time  as he did in the senate last year  it's not change when he offers four more years of bush economic policies that have failed to create well paying jobs  or insure our workers  or help americans afford the skyrocketing cost of college   policies that have lowered the real incomes of the average american family  widened the gap between wall street and main street  and left our children with a mountain of debt  and it's not change when he promises to continue a policy in iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in uniform and nothing of iraqi politicians   a policy where all we look for are reasons to stay in iraq  while we spend billions of dollars a month on a war that isn't making the american people any safer  so i'll say this   there are many words to describe john mccain's attempt to pass off his embrace of george bush's policies as bipartisan and new  but change is not one of them  change is a foreign policy that doesn't begin and end with a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged  i won't stand here and pretend that there are many good options left in iraq  but what's not an option is leaving our troops in that country for the next hundred years   especially at a time when our military is overstretched  our nation is isolated  and nearly every other threat to america is being ignored  we must be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in   but start leaving we must  it's time for iraqis to take responsibility for their future  it's time to rebuild our military and give our veterans the care they need and the benefits they deserve when they come home  it's time to refocus our efforts on al qaeda's leadership and afghanistan  and rally the world against the common threats of the  st century   terrorism and nuclear weapons  climate change and poverty  genocide and disease  that's what change is  change is realizing that meeting today's threats requires not just our firepower  but the power of our diplomacy   tough  direct diplomacy where the president of the united states isn't afraid to let any petty dictator know where america stands and what we stand for  we must once again have the courage and conviction to lead the free world  that is the legacy of roosevelt  and truman  and kennedy  that's what the american people want  that's what change is  change is building an economy that rewards not just wealth  but the work and workers who created it  it's understanding that the struggles facing working families can't be solved by spending billions of dollars on more tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy ceos  but by giving a the middle class a tax break  and investing in our crumbling infrastructure  and transforming how we use energy  and improving our schools  and renewing our commitment to science and innovation  it's understanding that fiscal responsibility and shared prosperity can go hand in hand  as they did when bill clinton was president  john mccain has spent a lot of time talking about trips to iraq in the last few weeks  but maybe if he spent some time taking trips to the cities and towns that have been hardest hit by this economy   cities in michigan  and ohio  and right here in minnesota   he'd understand the kind of change that people are looking for  maybe if he went to iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still can't pay the medical bills for a sister who's ill  he'd understand that she can't afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and wealthy  she needs us to pass health care plan that guarantees insurance to every american who wants it and brings down premiums for every family who needs it  that's the change we need  maybe if he went to pennsylvania and met the man who lost his job but can't even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one  he'd understand that we can't afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators  that man needs us to pass an energy policy that works with automakers to raise fuel standards  and makes corporations pay for their pollution  and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future   an energy policy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  that's the change we need  and maybe if he spent some time in the schools of south carolina or st  paul or where he spoke tonight in new orleans  he'd understand that we can't afford to leave the money behind for no child left behind  that we owe it to our children to invest in early childhood education  to recruit an army of new teachers and give them better pay and more support  to finally decide that in this global economy  the chance to get a college education should not be a privilege for the wealthy few  but the birthright of every american  that's the change we need in america  that's why i'm running for president  the other side will come here in september and offer a very different set of policies and positions  and that is a debate i look forward to  it is a debate the american people deserve  but what you don't deserve is another election that's governed by fear  and innuendo  and division  what you won't hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge  and patriotism as a bludgeon   that sees our opponents not as competitors to challenge  but enemies to demonize  because we may call ourselves democrats and republicans  but we are americans first  we are always americans first  despite what the good senator from arizona said tonight  i have seen people of differing views and opinions find common cause many times during my two decades in public life  and i have brought many together myself  i've walked arm in arm with community leaders on the south side of chicago and watched tensions fade as black  white  and latino fought together for good jobs and good schools  i've sat across the table from law enforcement and civil rights advocates to reform a criminal justice system that sent thirteen innocent people to death row  and i've worked with friends in the other party to provide more children with health insurance and more working families with a tax break  to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and ensure that the american people know where their tax dollars are being spent  and to reduce the influence of lobbyists who have all too often set the agenda in washington  in our country  i have found that this cooperation happens not because we agree on everything  but because behind all the labels and false divisions and categories that define us  beyond all the petty bickering and point scoring in washington  americans are a decent  generous  compassionate people  united by common challenges and common hopes  and every so often  there are moments which call on that fundamental goodness to make this country great again  so it was for that band of patriots who declared in a philadelphia hall the formation of a more perfect union  and for all those who gave on the fields of gettysburg and antietam their last full measure of devotion to save that same union  so it was for the greatest generation that conquered fear itself  and liberated a continent from tyranny  and made this country home to untold opportunity and prosperity  so it was for the workers who stood out on the picket lines  the women who shattered glass ceilings  the children who braved a selma bridge for freedom's cause  so it has been for every generation that faced down the greatest challenges and the most improbable odds to leave their children a world that's better  and kinder  and more just  and so it must be for us  america  this is our moment  this is our time  our time to turn the page on the policies of the past  our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face  our time to offer a new direction for the country we love  the journey will be difficult  the road will be long  i face this challenge with profound humility  and knowledge of my own limitations  but i also face it with limitless faith in the capacity of the american people  because if we are willing to work for it  and fight for it  and believe in it  then i am absolutely certain that generations from now  we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless  this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal  this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last  best hope on earth  this was the moment   this was the time   when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves  and our highest ideals  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless the united states of america "], ["obama1", "it's great to see so many friends from across the country  i want to congratulate howard friedman  david victor and howard kohr on a successful conference  and on the completion of a new headquarters just a few blocks away  before i begin  i want to say that i know some provocative emails have been circulating throughout jewish communities across the country  a few of you may have gotten them  they're filled with tall tales and dire warnings about a certain candidate for president  and all i want to say is   let me know if you see this guy named barack obama  because he sounds pretty frightening  but if anyone has been confused by these emails  i want you to know that today i'll be speaking from my heart  and as a true friend of israel  and i know that when i visit with aipac  i am among friends  good friends  friends who share my strong commitment to make sure that the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable today  tomorrow  and forever  one of the many things that i admire about aipac is that you fight for this common cause from the bottom up  the lifeblood of aipac is here in this room   grassroots activists of all ages  from all parts of the country  who come to washington year after year to make your voices heard  nothing reflects the face of aipac more than the   students who have travelled here to make it clear to the world that the bond between israel and the united states is rooted in more than our shared national interests   it's rooted in the shared values and shared stories of our people  and as president  i will work with you to ensure that it this bond strengthened  i first became familiar with the story of israel when i was eleven years old  i learned of the long journey and steady determination of the jewish people to preserve their identity through faith  family and culture  year after year  century after century  jews carried on their traditions  and their dream of a homeland  in the face of impossible odds  the story made a powerful impression on me  i had grown up without a sense of roots  my father was black  he was from kenya  and he left us when i was two  my mother was white  she was from kansas  and i'd moved with her to indonesia and then back to hawaii  in many ways  i didn't know where i came from  so i was drawn to the belief that you could sustain a spiritual  emotional and cultural identity  and i deeply understood the zionist idea   that there is always a homeland at the center of our story  i also learned about the horror of the holocaust  and the terrible urgency it brought to the journey home to israel  for much of my childhood  i lived with my grandparents  my grandfather had served in world war ii  and so had my great uncle  he was a kansas boy  who probably never expected to see europe   let alone the horrors that awaited him there  and for months after he came home from germany  he remained in a state of shock  alone with the painful memories that wouldn't leave his head  you see  my great uncle had been a part of the  th infantry division   the first americans to reach a nazi concentration camp  they liberated ohrdruf  part of buchenwald  on an april day in   the horrors of that camp go beyond our capacity to imagine  tens of thousands died of hunger  torture  disease  or plain murder   part of the nazi killing machine that killed   million people  when the americans marched in  they discovered huge piles of dead bodies and starving survivors  general eisenhower ordered germans from the nearby town to tour the camp  so they could see what was being done in their name  he ordered american troops to tour the camp  so they could see the evil they were fighting against  he invited congressmen and journalists to bear witness  and he ordered that photographs and films be made  explaining his actions  eisenhower said that he wanted to produce   first hand evidence of these things  if ever  in the future  there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda  i saw some of those very images at yad vashem  and they never leave you  and those images just hint at the stories that survivors of the shoah carried with them  like eisenhower  each of us bears witness to anyone and everyone who would deny these unspeakable crimes  or ever speak of repeating them  we must mean what we say when we speak the words   never again  it was just a few years after the liberation of the camps that david ben gurion declared the founding of the jewish state of israel  we know that the establishment of israel was just and necessary  rooted in centuries of struggle  and decades of patient work  but   years later  we know that we cannot relent  we cannot yield  and as president i will never compromise when it comes to israel's security  not when there are still voices that deny the holocaust  not when there are terrorist groups and political leaders committed to israel's destruction  not when there are maps across the middle east that don't even acknowledge israel's existence  and government funded textbooks filled with hatred toward jews  not when there are rockets raining down on sderot  and israeli children have to take a deep breath and summon uncommon courage every time they board a bus or walk to school  i have long understood israel's quest for peace and need for security  but never more so than during my travels there two years ago  flying in an idf helicopter  i saw a narrow and beautiful strip of land nestled against the mediterranean  on the ground  i met a family who saw their house destroyed by a katyusha rocket  i spoke to israeli troops who faced daily threats as they maintained security near the blue line  i talked to people who wanted nothing more simple  or elusive  than a secure future for their children  i have been proud to be a part of a strong  bi partisan consensus that has stood by israel in the face of all threats  that is a commitment that both john mccain and i share  because support for israel in this country goes beyond party  but part of our commitment must be speaking up when israel's security is at risk  and i don't think any of us can be satisfied that america's recent foreign policy has made israel more secure  hamas now controls gaza  hizbollah has tightened its grip on southern lebanon  and is flexing its muscles in beirut  because of the war in iraq  iran   which always posed a greater threat to israel than iraq   is emboldened  and poses the greatest strategic challenge to the united states and israel in the middle east in a generation  iraq is unstable  and al qaeda has stepped up its recruitment  israel's quest for peace with its neighbors has stalled  despite the heavy burdens borne by the israeli people  and america is more isolated in the region  reducing our strength and jeopardizing israel's safety  the question is how to move forward  there are those who would continue and intensify this failed status quo  ignoring eight years of accumulated evidence that our foreign policy is dangerously flawed  and then there are those who would lay all of the problems of the middle east at the doorstep of israel and its supporters  as if the israeli palestinian conflict is the root of all trouble in the region  these voices blame the middle east's only democracy for the region's extremism  they offer the false promise that abandoning a stalwart ally is somehow the path to strength  it is not  it never has been  and it never will be  our alliance is based on shared interests and shared values  those who threaten israel threaten us  israel has always faced these threats on the front lines  and i will bring to the white house an unshakeable commitment to israel's security  that starts with ensuring israel's qualitative military advantage  i will ensure that israel can defend itself from any threat   from gaza to tehran  defense cooperation between the united states and israel is a model of success  and must be deepened  as president  i will implement a memorandum of understanding that provides   billion in assistance to israel over the next decade   investments to israel's security that will not be tied to any other nation  first  we must approve the foreign aid request for   going forward  we can enhance our cooperation on missile defense  we should export military equipment to our ally israel under the same guidelines as nato  and i will always stand up for israel's right to defend itself in the united nations and around the world  across the political spectrum  israelis understand that real security can only come through lasting peace  and that is why we   as friends of israel   must resolve to do all we can to help israel and its neighbors to achieve it  because a secure  lasting peace is in israel's national interest  it is in america's national interest  and it is in the interest of the palestinian people and the arab world  as president  i will work to help israel achieve the goal of two states  a jewish state of israel and a palestinian state  living side by side in peace and security  and i won't wait until the waning days of my presidency  i will take an active role  and make a personal commitment to do all i can to advance the cause of peace from the start of my administration  the long road to peace requires palestinian partners committed to making the journey  we must isolate hamas unless and until they renounce terrorism  recognize israel's right to exist  and abide by past agreements  there is no room at the negotiating table for terrorist organizations  that is why i opposed holding elections in   with hamas on the ballot  the israelis and the palestinian authority warned us at the time against holding these elections  but this administration pressed ahead  and the result is a gaza controlled by hamas  with rockets raining down on israel  the palestinian people must understand that progress will not come through the false prophets of extremism or the corrupt use of foreign aid  the united states and the international community must stand by palestinians who are committed to cracking down on terror and carrying the burden of peacemaking  i will strongly urge arab governments to take steps to normalize relations with israel  and to fulfill their responsibility to pressure extremists and provide real support for president abbas and prime minister fayyad  egypt must cut off the smuggling of weapons into gaza  israel can also advance the cause of peace by taking appropriate steps   consistent with its security   to ease the freedom of movement for palestinians  improve economic conditions in the west bank  and to refrain from building new settlements   as it agreed to with the bush administration at annapolis  let me be clear  israel's security is sacrosanct  it is non negotiable  the palestinians need a state that is contiguous and cohesive  and that allows them to prosper   but any agreement with the palestinian people must preserve israel's identity as a jewish state  with secure  recognized and defensible borders  jerusalem will remain the capital of israel  and it must remain undivided  i have no illusions that this will be easy  it will require difficult decisions on both sides  but israel is strong enough to achieve peace  if it has partners who are committed to the goal  most israelis and palestinians want peace  and we must strengthen their hand  the united states must be a strong and consistent partner in this process   not to force concessions  but to help committed partners avoid stalemate and the kind of vacuums that are filled by violence  that's what i commit to do as president of the united states  the threats to israel start close to home  but they don't end there  syria continues its support for terror and meddling in lebanon  and syria has taken dangerous steps in pursuit of weapons of mass destruction  which is why israeli action was justified to end that threat  i also believe that the united states has a responsibility to support israel's efforts to renew peace talks with the syrians  we must never force israel to the negotiating table  but neither should we ever block negotiations when israel's leaders decide that they may serve israeli interests  as president  i will do whatever i can to help israel succeed in these negotiations  and success will require the full enforcement of security council resolution   in lebanon  and a stop to syria's support for terror  it is time for this reckless behavior to come to an end  there is no greater threat to israel   or to the peace and stability of the region   than iran  now this audience is made up of both republicans and democrats  and the enemies of israel should have no doubt that  regardless of party  americans stand shoulder to shoulder in our commitment to israel's security  so while i don't want to strike too partisan a note here today  i do want to address some willful mischaracterizations of my positions  the iranian regime supports violent extremists and challenges us across the region  it pursues a nuclear capability that could spark a dangerous arms race  and raise the prospect of a transfer of nuclear know how to terrorists  its president denies the holocaust and threatens to wipe israel off the map  the danger from iran is grave  it is real  and my goal will be to eliminate this threat  but just as we are clear eyed about the threat  we must be clear about the failure of today's policy  we knew  in   that iran supported terrorism  we knew iran had an illicit nuclear program  we knew iran posed a grave threat to israel  but instead of pursuing a strategy to address this threat  we ignored it and instead invaded and occupied iraq  when i opposed the war  i warned that it would fan the flames of extremism in the middle east  that is precisely what happened in iran   the hardliners tightened their grip  and mahmoud ahmadinejad was elected president in   and the united states and israel are less secure  i respect senator mccain  and look forward to a substantive debate with him these next five months  but on this point  we have differed  and we will differ  senator mccain refuses to understand or acknowledge the failure of the policy that he would continue  he criticizes my willingness to use strong diplomacy  but offers only an alternate reality   one where the war in iraq has somehow put iran on its heels  the truth is the opposite  iran has strengthened its position  iran is now enriching uranium  and has reportedly stockpiled   kilos of low enriched uranium  its support for terrorism and threats toward israel have increased  those are the facts  they cannot be denied  and i refuse to continue a policy that has made the united states and israel less secure  senator mccain offers a false choice  stay the course in iraq  or cede the region to iran  i reject this logic because there is a better way  keeping all of our troops tied down indefinitely in iraq is not the way to weaken iran   it is precisely what has strengthened it  it is a policy for staying  not a plan for victory  i have proposed a responsible  phased redeployment of our troops from iraq  we will get out as carefully as we were careless getting in  we will finally pressure iraq's leaders to take meaningful responsibility for their own future  we will also use all elements of american power to pressure iran  i will do everything in my power to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon  that starts with aggressive  principled diplomacy without self defeating preconditions  but with a clear eyed understanding of our interests  we have no time to waste  we cannot unconditionally rule out an approach that could prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon  we have tried limited  piecemeal talks while we outsource the sustained work to our european allies  it is time for the united states to lead  there will be careful preparation  we will open up lines of communication  build an agenda  coordinate closely with our allies  and evaluate the potential for progress  contrary to the claims of some  i have no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking  but as president of the united states  i would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate iranian leader at a time and place of my choosing   if  and only if   it can advance the interests of the united states  only recently have some come to think that diplomacy by definition cannot be tough  they forget the example of truman  and kennedy and reagan  these presidents understood that diplomacy backed by real leverage was a fundamental tool of statecraft  and it is time to once again make american diplomacy a tool to succeed  not just a means of containing failure  we will pursue this diplomacy with no illusions about the iranian regime  instead  we will present a clear choice  if you abandon your dangerous nuclear program  support for terror  and threats to israel  there will be meaningful incentives   including the lifting of sanctions  and political and economic integration with the international community  if you refuse  we will ratchet up the pressure  my presidency will strengthen our hand as we restore our standing  our willingness to pursue diplomacy will make it easier to mobilize others to join our cause  if iran fails to change course when presented with this choice by the united states  it will be clear   to the people of iran  and to the world   that the iranian regime is the author of its own isolation  that will strengthen our hand with russia and china as we insist on stronger sanctions in the security council  and we should work with europe  japan and the gulf states to find every avenue outside the un to isolate the iranian regime   from cutting off loan guarantees and expanding financial sanctions  to banning the export of refined petroleum to iran  to boycotting firms associated with the iranian revolutionary guard  whose quds force has rightly been labeled a terrorist organization  i was interested to see senator mccain propose divestment as a source of leverage   not the bigoted divestment that has sought to punish israeli scientists and academics  but divestment targeted at the iranian regime  it's a good concept  but not a new one  i introduced legislation over a year ago that would encourage states and the private sector to divest from companies that do business in iran  this bill has bipartisan support  but for reasons that i'll let him explain  senator mccain never signed on  meanwhile  an anonymous senator is blocking the bill  it is time to pass this into law so that we can tighten the squeeze on the iranian regime  we should also pursue other unilateral sanctions that target iranian banks and assets  and we must free ourselves from the tyranny of oil  the price of a barrel of oil is one of the most dangerous weapons in the world  petrodollars pay for weapons that kill american troops and israeli citizens  and the bush administration's policies have driven up the price of oil  while its energy policy has made us more dependent on foreign oil and gas  it's time for the united states to take real steps to end our addiction to oil  and we can join with israel  building on last year's us israel energy cooperation act  to deepen our partnership in developing alternative sources of energy by increasing scientific collaboration and joint research and development  the surest way to increase our leverage in the long term is to stop bankrolling the iranian regime  finally  let there be no doubt  i will always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally israel  sometimes there are no alternatives to confrontation  but that only makes diplomacy more important  if we must use military force  we are more likely to succeed  and will have far greater support at home and abroad  if we have exhausted our diplomatic efforts  that is the change we need in our foreign policy  change that restores american power and influence  change accompanied by a pledge that i will make known to allies and adversaries alike  that america maintains an unwavering friendship with israel  and an unshakeable commitment to its security  as members of aipac  you have helped advance this bipartisan consensus to support and defend our ally israel  and i am sure that today on capitol hill you will be meeting with members of congress and spreading the word  but we are here because of more than policy  we are here because the values we hold dear are deeply embedded in the story of israel  just look at what israel has accomplished in   years  from decades of struggle and the terrible wake of the holocaust  a nation was forged to provide a home for jews from all corners of the world   from syria to ethiopia to the soviet union  in the face of constant threats  israel has triumphed  in the face of constant peril  israel has prospered  in a state of constant insecurity  israel has maintained a vibrant and open discourse  and a resilient commitment to the rule of law  as any israeli will tell you  israel is not a perfect place  but like the united states it sets an example for all when it seeks a more perfect future  these same qualities can be found among american jews  it is why so many jewish americans have stood by israel  while advancing the american story  because there is a commitment embedded in the jewish faith and tradition  to freedom and fairness  to social justice and equal opportunity  to tikkun olam   the obligation to repair this world  i will never forget that i would not be standing here today if it weren't for that commitment  in the great social movements in our country's history  jewish and african americans have stood shoulder to shoulder  they took buses down south together  they marched together  they bled together  and jewish americans like andrew goodman and michael schwerner were willing to die alongside a black man   james chaney   on behalf of freedom and equality  their legacy is our inheritance  we must not allow the relationship between jews and african americans to suffer  this is a bond that must be strengthened  together  we can rededicate ourselves to end prejudice and combat hatred in all of its forms  together  we can renew our commitment to justice  together  we can join our voices together  and in doing so make even the mightiest of walls fall down  that work must include our shared commitment to israel  you and i know that we must do more than stand still  now is the time to be vigilant in facing down every foe  just as we move forward in seeking a future of peace for the children of israel  and for all children  now is the time to stand by israel as it writes the next chapter in its extraordinary journey  now is the time to join together in the work of repairing this world "], ["obama1", "before mark leaves the stage  let me just say what a privilege it is to have the support of such a remarkable leader  let me also say that mark's wife  lisa collis  has been a terrific supporter for several months  as an entrepreneur  a governor  and a leader in the democratic party   mark has provided extraordinary leadership that has achieved extraordinary results  he knows that the challenges we face are not about left versus right or democrat versus republican   they are about the past versus the future  and mark warner has followed a simple formula to deliver real change   he brings people together around a common purpose  and common sense solutions  as governor  he put partisanship aside  turned a budget deficit into a surplus  expanded health care for children  and made the largest investment in k  education in virginia history  he knows that folks here in southwest virginia should be able to live their dreams without leaving their hometown  and that america needs an energy policy that grows our economy  secures our country  and saves our planet  i look forward to campaigning with him this fall  and as president of the united states  i look forward to working with mark warner to bring fundamental change to washington when he joins jim webb as the next great senator from the commonwealth of virginia  i'd like to say a few words today about one of the most important challenges we face in this country and one of the biggest issues in this election   our health care crisis  you know  i've been traveling across america on this campaign for   months now  and everywhere i've gone  i've heard heartbreaking stories about our health care system  there's the young woman i met who works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't afford medicine for a sister who's ill  or the man i met who almost lost his home because he has three children with cystic fibrosis and couldn't pay their health care bills  who still doesn't have health insurance for himself or his wife and lives in fear that a single illness could cost them everything  this election is about them  it's about you  it's about every one of the   million americans in virginia  in tennessee and across this country  who are going without the health care they need and the millions more who are struggling to pay rising costs  but let's be honest   we've been talking about this for a long time  year after year  election after election  candidates make promises about fixing health care and cutting costs  and then they go back to washington  and nothing changes   because the big drug and insurance companies write another check or because lobbyists use their clout to block reform  and when the next election rolls around  even more americans are uninsured  and even more families are struggling to pay their medical bills  well  we're here today because we know that if we're going to make real progress  this time must be different  throughout my career  in illinois and the united states senate  i've worked to reduce the power of the special interests by leading the fight for ethics reform  i've sent a strong signal in this campaign by refusing the contributions of registered federal lobbyists and pacs  and today  i'm announcing that going forward  the democratic national committee will uphold the same standard and won't take another dime from washington lobbyists or special interest pacs  they do not fund my campaign  they will not fund our party  and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i'm president of the united states  it's time to finally challenge the special interests and provide universal health care for all  that's why i'm running for president of the united states   because i believe that health care should be guaranteed for every american who wants it and affordable for every american who needs it  and this is an area where john mccain and i have a fundamental disagreement  now  i respect john mccain  and i honor his service to this country  my differences with him are not personal  they're about the policies he's proposed on this campaign   policies that are no different than the ones that have failed us for the last eight years  and that starts with health care  we know that since george bush took office  premiums have gone up four times faster than wages  and virginia families are now paying over   more for health care  seven million more americans are uninsured  including nearly   here in virginia  yet john mccain actually wants to double down on the failed policies that have done so little to help ordinary americans  like george bush  senator mccain has a plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy  instead of offering a comprehensive plan to cover all americans and control rising costs  he's offering a tax cut that doesn't even amount to half of the cost of an average family health care plan  and won't make health care affordable for the hardworking americans who need help most  but it's not just that his plan won't help reduce costs  it could actually drive costs up  senator mccain's plan would weaken the employer based system that most americans count on for health care  it's a plan that could subject your coverage to the whims of the market  generate up to   billion in new administrative costs  and actually put health care costs out of reach for even more older workers  even more sick americans  and even more families  senator mccain's campaign has even acknowledged that his plan could have the effect of raising taxes on some workers  well  i don't think the american people can afford another four years of a health care plan that does more to help the big drug and insurance companies than it does to lower costs for ordinary americans  we need to make health care affordable for every single american  and that's what i'll do as president  in an obama administration  we'll lower premiums by up to   for a typical family per year  and we'll do it by investing in disease prevention  not just disease management  by investing in a paperless health care system to reduce administrative costs  and by covering every single american and making sure that they can take their health care with them if they lose their job  we'll also reduce costs for business and their workers by picking up the tab for some of the most expensive illnesses  and we won't do all this twenty years from now  or ten years from now  we'll do it by the end of my first term as president of the united states  so the american people will have a clear choice on health care in the fall  we can either extend the bush policies that we know don't work  or at this moment  in this election  we can come together and say enough is enough  we're going to finally solve this problem once and for all  i don't want to wake up many years from now and see that even more americans are uninsured and even more seniors can't afford prescription drugs and even more families are being driven to financial ruin trying to pay their bills because we failed to take on the drug and insurance companies and provide universal health care  that's not the future i want for my children  that's not the future i want for your children  that's not the future i want for this country  i want to wake up and know that every single american has health care when they need it  that every senior has prescription drugs they can afford  and that no parents are going to bed at night worrying about how they'll afford medicine for a sick child  that's the future we can build together  that's the choice you'll have this fall  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america "], ["obama1", "before we begin  i just want to take a minute to thank senator clinton for the kind and generous support she offered on saturday  she ran an historic campaign that shattered barriers on behalf of my daughters and women everywhere who now know there are no limits to their dreams  and more  she inspired millions of women and men with her strength  her courage  and her unyielding commitment to the causes that brought us here today   the hopes and aspirations of working americans  our party and our country are stronger because of the work she has done throughout her life  and i look forward to working with her in these coming months and years to lay out the case for change and set a new course for this country  i've often said that this election represents a defining moment in our history  on major issues like the war in iraq or the warming of our planet  the decisions we make in november and over the next few years will shape a generation  if not a century  that is especially true when it comes to our economy  we have now lost jobs for five straight months   more than   since the beginning of this year  last month we saw the biggest rise in the unemployment rate in more than twenty years  the percentage of homes in foreclosure and late mortgage payments is the highest since the great depression  the price of oil has never been higher and set a record on friday for the largest one day spike in history  the costs of health care and college tuition and even food have all hit record levels  while family incomes have fallen and the wages of our workers have stayed the same  you don't have to read the stock tickers or scan the headlines in the financial section to understand the seriousness of the situation we're in right now  you just have to go to pennsylvania and listen to the man who lost his job but can't even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one  or listen to the woman from iowa who works the night shift after a full day of class and still can't pay the medical bills for a sister who's ill  or talk to the worker i met in indiana who worked at the same plant his father worked at for thirty years until they moved it to mexico and made the workers actually pack up the equipment themselves so they could send it to china  go to janesville  wisconsin or moraine  ohio and talk to the workers at general motors who just found out the plants they labored their entire lives at will be closed forever  or the thousands of truck drivers and airline workers who will lose their jobs because of the debilitating cost of fuel  or just ask any family in north carolina who will sit around their kitchen table tonight and wonder whether next week's paycheck will be enough to cover next month's bills   who will look at their children without knowing if they'll be able to give them the same chances that they had  we did not arrive at the doorstep of our current economic crisis by some accident of history  this was not an inevitable part of the business cycle that was beyond our power to avoid  it was the logical conclusion of a tired and misguided philosophy that has dominated washington for far too long  george bush called it the ownership society  but it's little more than a worn dogma that says we should give more to those at the top and hope that their good fortune trickles down to the hardworking many  for eight long years  our president sacrificed investments in health care  and education  and energy  and infrastructure on the altar of tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy ceos   trillions of dollars in giveaways that proved neither compassionate nor conservative  and for all of george bush's professed faith in free markets  the markets have hardly been free   not when the gates of washington are thrown open to high priced lobbyists who rig the rules of the road and riddle our tax code with special interest favors and corporate loopholes  as a result of such special interest driven policies and lax regulation  we haven't seen prosperity trickling down to main street  instead  a housing crisis that could leave up to two million homeowners facing foreclosure has shaken confidence in the entire economy  i understand that the challenges facing our economy didn't start the day george bush took office and they won't end the day he leaves  some are partly the result of forces that have globalized our economy over the last several decades   revolutions in communication and technology have sent jobs wherever there's an internet connection  that have forced children in raleigh and boston to compete for those jobs with children in bangalore and beijing  we live in a more competitive world  and that is a fact that cannot be reversed  but i also know that this nation has faced such fundamental change before  and each time we've kept our economy strong and competitive by making the decision to expand opportunity outward  to grow our middle class  to invest in innovation  and most importantly  to invest in the education and well being of our workers  we've done this because in america  our prosperity has always risen from the bottom up  from the earliest days of our founding  it has been the hard work and ingenuity of our people that's served as the wellspring of our economic strength  that's why we built a system of free public high schools when we transitioned from a nation of farms to a nation of factories  that's why we sent my grandfather's generation to college  and declared a minimum wage for our workers  and promised to live in dignity after they retire through the creation of social security  that's why we've invested in the science and research that have led to new discoveries and entire new industries  and that's what this country will do again when i am president of the united states  we will begin this general election campaign by traveling across the country for the next few weeks to talk about what specifically we need to do to build a  st economy that works for working americans  i will speak with economic experts and advisors at the end of the tour  but first i want to speak with you  and hear about your thoughts and your struggles in the places where you live and work  and at each stop  i will take the opportunity to lay out the very real and very serious differences on the economy between myself and senator mccain  as i've said before  john mccain is an american hero whose military service we honor  he can also legitimately tout moments of independents from his party  and on some issues  such as earmark reform and climate change  he and i share goals  even if we may differ on how to get there  but when it comes to the economy  john mccain and i have a fundamentally different vision of where to take the country  because for all his talk of independence  the centerpiece of his economic plan amounts to a full throated endorsement of george bush's policies  he says we've made  great progress  in our economy these past eight years  he calls himself a fiscal conservative and on the campaign trail he's passionate critic of government spending  and yet he has no problem spending hundreds of billions of dollars on tax breaks for big corporations and a permanent occupation of iraq   policies that have left our children with a mountain of debt  george bush's policies have taken us from a projected   trillion dollar surplus at the end of the clinton administration to massive deficits and nearly four trillion dollars in new debt today  we were promised a fiscal conservative  instead  we got the most fiscally irresponsible administration in history  and now john mccain wants to give us another  well we've been there once  and we're not going back  it's time to move this country forward  i have a different vision for the future  instead of spending twelve billion dollars a month to rebuild iraq  i think it's time we invested in our roads and schools and bridges and started to rebuild america  instead of handing out giveaways to corporations that don't need them and didn't ask for them  it's time we started giving a hand up to families who are trying pay their medical bills and send their children to college  we can't afford four more years of skewed priorities that give us nothing but record debt   we need change that works for the american people  and that is the choice in this election my vision involves both a short term plan to help working families who are struggling to keep up and a long term agenda to make america competitive in a global economy  a week from today  i'll be talking about this long term agenda in more detail  it's an agenda that will require us first and foremost to train and educate our workforce with the skills necessary to compete in a knowledge based economy  we'll also need to place a greater emphasis on areas like science and technology that will define the workforce of the  st century  and invest in the research and innovation necessary to create the jobs and industries of the future right here in america  one place where that investment would make an enormous difference is in a renewable energy policy that ends our addiction on foreign oil  provides real long term relief from high fuel costs  and builds a green economy that could create up to five million well paying jobs that can't be outsourced  we can also create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our schools  roads  bridges  and other critical infrastructure that needs repair  and because we know that we can't or shouldn't put up walls around our economy  a long term agenda will also find a way to make trade work for american workers  we do the cause of free trade   a cause i believe in   no good when we pass trade agreements that hand out favors to special interests and do little to help workers who have to watch their factories close down  there is nothing protectionist about demanding that trade spreads the benefits of globalization as broadly as possible  that's what we need to do in the long term  but today i want to focus on what we must do in the short term to lift up our workers  ease the struggle that so many families are facing right now  and restore a sense of fairness and balance to our economy  such relief that can't wait until the next president takes office  in january  well before the administration seemed to discover ordinary americans were struggling  i called for a fiscal stimulus plan to get checks in the hands of hard working families and seniors  congress passed such a plan and the first checks are now arriving  but since then hundreds of thousands more people have lost their jobs  and so we must do more  that's why i've called for another round of fiscal stimulus  an immediate   billion to help those who've been hit hardest by this economic downturn   americans who have lost their jobs  their homes  and are facing rising costs and cutbacks in state and local services like education and healthcare  we need to expand unemployment benefits and extend them for those who can't find another job right away   especially since the long term unemployment rate is nearly twice as high as it was during the last recession  and we must help the millions of homeowners who are facing foreclosure through no fault of their own  as late as december  john mccain told a newspaper in new hampshire that he'd love to offer a solution to the housing crisis  but he just didn't have one  it took him three different tries to figure it out  and in the end  his plan does nothing to help   million homeowners who are facing foreclosure  even as he supported spending billions to bail out wall street  president bush told the american people he thought the biggest danger arising from this housing crisis was the temptation to do something about it  now senator mccain wants to turn bush's policy of 'too little  too late' into a policy of 'even less  even later'  that's not the change we need right now  that's what got us into this mess in the first place  in contrast  i offered a proposal to crack down on mortgage fraud almost two years ago  and in this campaign i've called for the immediate creation of a   billion foreclosure prevention fund to provide direct relief to victims of the housing crisis  we'll also help those who are facing foreclosure refinance their mortgages so they can stay in their homes at rates they can afford  i'll provide struggling homeowners relief by offering a tax credit to low  and middle income americans that would cover ten percent of their mortgage interest payment every year  the principle is simple   if the government can bail out investment banks on wall street  we can extend a hand to folks who are struggling on main street  as president  i'll get tough on enforcement  raise the penalties on lenders who break the rules  and implement a new home score system that will allow consumers to find out more about mortgage offers and whether they'll be able to make payments  this kind of transparency won't just make our homeowners more secure  it will make our markets more stable  and keep our economy strong and competitive in the future  that's the change americans need  and that's what i'll do as president  as the housing crisis spills over into other parts of the economy  we also need to help the millions of americans who are struggling under skyrocketing costs and stagnant wages that are pushing working families towards a debt spiral from which they can't escape  we have to give them a way out by lowering costs  putting more money in their pockets  and rebuilding a safety net that's becoming badly frayed over the last few decades  when it comes to reliving these economic anxieties that working families feel  nothing matches the burden they face from crushing health care costs  john mccain's approach to health care mirrors that of george bush  he's promising four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy   a plan that will actually make it easier   easier   than it already is for insurance companies to deny coverage to the elderly or the sick or those with pre existing conditions  it may lead millions to lose the coverage they already have and millions more to have to pay even more than they do right now  we can't afford that  not when   million americans are already uninsured  a number that is growing by the day  not when families and businesses across the country are being crushed by the growing burden of health care costs and when half of all personal bankruptcies are caused by medical bills  when i am president  we'll take a different approach  we will give every american the chance to get the same kind of health care that members of congress give themselves  we'll bring down premiums by   for the typical family  and we'll prevent insurance companies from discriminating against those who need care most  and we won't just lower costs for families  we'll lower costs for the entire country by making our health care system more efficient through better technology and more emphasis on prevention  that's the choice in this election  and that's the change i'll bring as president  just as we need to reform our health care system  we also have to reform a tax code that rewards wealth over work   a  page monstrosity that high priced lobbyists have rigged with page after page of special interest loopholes and tax shelters  a tax code that continues george bush's billion dollar giveaways to big corporations and wealthy ceos  a tax code that has plunged this country deeper and deeper into debt  john mccain takes great pride in saying that he's a fiscal conservative  and he's already signaled that he will try to define me with the same old tax and spend label that his side has been throwing around for decades  but let's look at the facts  john mccain once said that he couldn't vote for the bush tax breaks in good conscience because they were too skewed to the wealthiest americans  later  he said it was irresponsible to cut taxes during a time of war because we simply couldn't afford them  well  nothing's changed about the war  but something's certainly changed about john mccain  because these same bush tax cuts are now his central economic policy  not only that  but he is now calling for a new round of tax giveaways that are twice as expensive as the original bush plan and nearly twice as regressive  his policy will spend nearly   trillion on tax breaks for corporations  including   billion for exxon alone  a company that just recorded the highest profits in history  think about that  at a time when we're fighting two wars  when millions of americans can't afford their medical bills or their tuition bills  when we're paying more than   a gallon for gas  the man who rails against government spending wants to spend   billion on a tax break for exxon mobil  that isn't just irresponsible  it's outrageous  if john mccain's policies were implemented  they would add   trillion to the national debt over the next decade  that isn't fiscal conservatism  that's what george bush has done over the last eight years  not only can working families not afford it  future generations can't afford it  and we can't allow it to happen in this election  i'll take a different approach  i will reform our tax code so that it's simple  fair  and advances opportunity instead of distorting the market by advancing the agenda of some lobbyist or oil company  i'll shut down the corporate loopholes and tax havens  and i'll use the money to help pay for a middle class tax cut that will provide   of relief to   of workers and their families  i'll make oil companies like exxon pay a tax on their windfall profits  and we'll use the money to help families pay for their skyrocketing energy costs and other bills  we'll also eliminate income taxes for any retiree making less than   per year  because every senior deserves to live out their life in dignity and respect  and while john mccain wants to pick up where george bush left off by trying again to privatize social security  i will never waver in my commitment to protect that basic promise as president  we will not privatize social security  we will not raise the retirement age  and we will save social security for future generations by asking the wealthiest americans to pay their fair share  now  contrary to what john mccain may say  every single proposal that i've made in this campaign is paid for   because i believe in pay as you go  senator mccain is right that there's waste in government  and i intend to root it out as president  but his suggestion that the earmark reforms that we're both interested in implementing will somehow make up for his enormous tax giveaway indicates that john mccain was right when he said that he doesn't understand the economy as well as he should  either that or he's hoping you just won't notice  whatever it is  it's not the kind of change we need in washington right now  i'll be talking in more detail next week about how we can make our workforce more competitive by reforming our education system  but there's also an immediate squeeze we need to deal with  and that's college affordability  i know how expensive this is from firsthand experience  at the beginning of our marriage  michelle and i were spending so much of our income just to pay off our college loans  and that was decades ago  the cost of a college education has exploded since then  pricing hundreds of thousands of young americans out of their dream every year  or forcing them to begin their careers in unconscionable debt  so i'll offer this promise to every student as president   your country will offer you   a year of tuition if you offer your country community or national service when you graduate  if you invest in america  america will invest in you  as far as we can tell  john mccain doesn't have a plan to make college more affordable  and that means he isn't listening to the struggles facing a new generation of americans  finally  we need to help those americans who find themselves in a debt spiral climb out  since so many who are struggling to keep up with their mortgages are now shifting their debt to credit cards  we have to make sure that credit cards don't become the next stage in the housing crisis  to make sure that americans know what they're signing up for  i'll institute a five star rating system to inform consumers about the level of risk involved in every credit card  and we'll establish a credit card bill of rights that will ban unilateral changes to credit card agreements  ban rate hikes on debt you already had  and ban interest charges on late fees  americans need to pay what they owe  but you should pay what's fair  not just what fattens profits for some credit card company and they can get away with  the same principle should apply to our bankruptcy laws  when i first arrived in the senate  i opposed the credit card industry's bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to climb out of debt  john mccain supported that bill   and he even opposed exempting families who were only in bankruptcy because of medical expenses they couldn't pay  when i'm president  we'll reform our bankruptcy laws so that we give americans who find themselves in debt a second chance  we'll make sure that if you can demonstrate that you went bankrupt because of medical expenses  you can relieve that debt and get back on your feet  and i'll make sure that ceos can't dump your pension with one hand while they collect a bonus with the other  that's an outrage  and it's time we had a president who knows it's an outrage  this is the choice you will face in november  you can vote for john mccain  and see a continuation of bush economic policies   more tax cuts to the wealthy  more corporate tax breaks  more mountains of debt  and little to no relief for families struggling with the rising costs of everything from health care to a college education  but i don't think that is the future we want  the americans i've met over the last sixteen months in town halls and living rooms  on farms and front porches   they may come from different places and have different backgrounds  but they hold common hopes and dream the same simple dreams  they know government can't solve all their problems  and they don't expect it to  they believe in personal responsibility  and hard work  and self reliance  they don't like seeing their tax dollars wasted  but we also believe in an america where unrivaled prosperity brings boundless opportunity   a place where jobs are there for the willing  where hard work is rewarded with a decent living  where no matter how much you start with or where you come from or who your parents are  you can make it if you try  we believe in the country that gave my grandfather and a generation of heroes the chance to go to college on the gi bill when they came home from world war ii   a gi bill that helped create the largest middle class in history  we believe in the country that made it possible for my mother   a single parent who didn't have much   to send my sister and me to the best schools in the country with the help of scholarships  we believe in the country that allowed my father in law   a city worker at a water filtration plant on the south side of chicago   to provide for his wife and two children on a single salary  he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at age thirty  but that didn't stop him from going to work every day   often with the help of a walker   so that could send my wife and her brother to one of the best colleges in the nation  his job didn't just give him a paycheck  it gave him a sense of dignity and self worth  his country didn't just reward wealth  but the work and the workers who created it  and that is the america we believe in  that is the choice we face right now   a choice between more of the same policies that have widened inequality  added to our debt  and shaken the foundation of our economy  or change that will restore balance to our economy  that will invest in the ingenuity and innovation of our people  that will fuel a bottom up prosperity to keep america strong and competitive in the  st century  it is not left or right   liberal or conservative   to say that we have tried it their way for eight long years  and it has failed  it is time to try something new  it is time for change  the challenges we face are great  and we may not meet them in one term or with one president  but history tells us we have met greater challenges before  and the seriousness of this moment tells us we can't afford not to try  so as we set out on this journey  let us also forge a new path   a path that leads to unrivaled prosperity  to boundless opportunity  to the america we believe in and a dream that will always endure  thank you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "before we begin  i just wanted to say a word about the flooding devastating so many communities  we were scheduled to be holding this event in iowa  but we decided to cancel it because we didn't want to divert state resources from going to help with flood relief  my heart goes out to the families in iowa  wisconsin  illinois and across the midwest  who have been forced to flee their own homes  and leave their businesses and communities behind  right now  many of them are wondering when they'll be able to return  and what they'll find when they get there  well  we cannot assure them that their communities will be rebuilt overnight  but we can assure them that they will be rebuilt   because we'll work to ensure that the full resources of our state and federal government are there to help  and i will do everything in my power to see to it that those resources get to the people who need them as swiftly as possible  you know  over the next two weeks  i'm going to be talking a lot about what we can do to build an economy that works for all americans  because for families all across this country  our economy hasn't been working for quite some time  i've met americans who are doing everything right   who are working that extra shift  or taking on that extra job   but are still struggling just to make ends meet  and a big part of the reason is that they're paying   a gallon for gas  and skyrocketing costs for groceries  health care  and college tuition   at a time when their wages have stayed the same  as a result  many of them are falling deeper and deeper into debt  and a lot of that debt is being put onto credit cards  over the past   years  average household credit card debt has tripled  the typical family is now nearly   in the red  and bankruptcy rates have steadily climbed over the past year  now  let's be honest  part of why our debt crisis is so bad is that some folks are making reckless decisions   racking up big credit card bills by purchasing flat screen tvs and other luxury goods that they know they can't afford  and they should have to face the consequences of those decisions  but many more americans aren't falling into debt because they made an irresponsible decision  they're falling into debt because credit card companies are pushing them over the edge  for too long  credit card companies have been using unfair and deceptive practices to trick americans into signing agreements they can't afford  the contracts you sign when you get a card have gone from being one page long a few decades ago to more than thirty pages long today  and they're often filled with traps and fine print that only a credit card executive could understand  these companies have been crossing the line to boost their bottom line  but rather than stop this outrage  washington has let them get away with it  and it's no wonder   because the credit card companies have spent millions in recent years financing political campaigns and lobbying congress to get laws written to their liking  in the first quarter of this year alone  one such industry group spent nearly   on lobbying  this has to stop  we cannot let the rules of the game continue to be rigged against ordinary americans  we need a president who will look out for the interests of hardworking families  not just their big campaign donors and corporate allies  and that will be a real difference in this election  because when it comes to washington letting credit card companies get away with all this  john mccain has been part of the problem  when he had the chance to help families avoid falling into debt  john mccain sided with the credit card companies  when he had the chance to protect teenagers and college students from deceptive credit card practices  he sided with the credit card companies  and when i fought against the credit card industry's bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to climb out of debt  he supported it   and he even opposed exempting families who were only in bankruptcy because of medical expenses they couldn't pay  just look at the proposals he's been making on this campaign  he's calling for nearly   trillion in corporate tax cuts over the next decade  but he hasn't even proposed a single measure to protect hardworking americans from credit card companies that are trying to take advantage of them  well  that's not the kind of change that the folks i've met are looking for  they're looking for a president who will fight for them  and restore fairness to our economy  that's the kind of president i'll be  i'll put a middle class tax cut into the pockets of hardworking families   a tax cut that will give   of all families   in relief  i'll eliminate income taxes for seniors making less than   a year  and i'll protect the rights of ordinary americans by cracking down on companies that are trying to deceive them  that's why back in november  i proposed a plan to help ensure that credit cards don't become the next subprime crisis  it starts with making sure that we have a system that's open and transparent  to help you understand the risks that are involved in signing up for a credit card  i'll create a five star rating system  that way  americans can compare credit card companies and avoid those that are stacking the deck against them  now  don't get me wrong  we all have a responsibility to pay what we owe  but we have to ensure that the amount we're paying is fair  that's why i've proposed a credit card bill of rights  the first thing we'll do under this bill of rights is ban unilateral changes to credit card agreements  you should pay the rate you signed up for  if the credit card company wants to raise that rate  you should be able to opt out of the agreement  second  we'll ban rate changes on past debt  if a credit card company wants to raise interest rates  then that new  higher rate should apply to the debt you add going forward  not what you already owe  the store can't change the price of what you bought after you bought it and neither should your credit card  third  we'll ban interest on transaction fees  if you're late in making a payment  you have to pay a late fee  but you shouldn't be paying a fee for paying a fee  it's time washington established some rules of the road to level the playing field for hardworking families  it's time we had an economy that worked for companies and consumers alike  that's what my campaign is all about  so the american people will have a clear choice in november  you can choose an approach that sides with the credit card companies when it really counts  or you can choose to finally have a president who looks out for main street  not just wall street  a president who fights each day to put the american dream within reach for all americans  and that's the kind of president i intend to be  thank you "], ["obama1", "for generations  we have worked to keep a simple promise in this country   americans who work hard their entire lives have earned the right to retire with dignity and security  that is the promise that my grandparents knew  even though they came of age in the depression  my grandfather would go on to serve in patton's army  and my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line while he marched across europe  when they set out west from kansas to build their lives after the war  they did so with the confidence that washington would help them reach a secure retirement  that was the promise that fdr made  and it was a promise that washington kept for decades while folks like my grandparents moved through the ups and downs of life in america's middle class  but today  washington is not working to preserve this fundamental part of the american dream  a secure retirement is no longer a guarantee for the middle class  it's harder to save and harder to retire  people are losing their pensions  if we do not act  the promise of social security will grow harder to keep  that's why i will fight every day to extend the promise of a retirement that is dignified and secure when i am president of the united states  it starts with protecting social security today  tomorrow  and forever  for millions of americans  social security is the difference between a comfortable retirement and the risk of poverty  we have an obligation to secure the future of one of the most successful programs in our history  and that starts with talking straight to the american people about the challenges that lie ahead  social security is strong  but as more baby boomers retire  the long term cash flow needs to be addressed  we have to make sure social security is there for future generations  now  john mccain's ideas on social security amount to four more years of what was attempted and failed under george bush  he said he supports private accounts for social security   in his words   along the lines that president bush proposed  yesterday he tried to deny that he ever took that position  leaving us wondering if he had a change of heart or a change of politics  well let me be clear  privatizing social security was a bad idea when george w  bush proposed it  it's a bad idea today  it would eventually cut guaranteed benefits by up to   it would cost a trillion dollars that we don't have to implement on the front end  permanently elevating our debt  and most of all  it would gamble the retirement plans of millions of americans on the stock market  that's why i stood up against this plan in the senate  and that's why i won't stand for it as president  but senator mccain's campaign went even further a few months ago  suggesting that the best answer to the growing pressures on social security might be to cut cost of living adjustments or to raise the retirement age  i think there is another option that is fairer to working men and women  we have to protect social security for future generations without pushing the burden on to seniors who have earned the right to retire in dignity  here's where i would start  right now  the social security payroll tax is capped  that means most middle class families pay this tax on every dime they make  while millionaires and billionaires are only paying it on a very small percentage of their income  that's why i think the best way forward is to first look to adjust the cap on the payroll tax so that people like me pay a little bit more and people in need are protected  that way we can extend the promise of social security without shifting the burden on to seniors  and we should exempt anyone making under   from this increase so that the change doesn't burden middle class americans  this means that   of americans will see absolutely no change in their taxes under my plan     now  there was a time when john mccain thought this wasn't such a bad idea  when he was asked a few years ago whether he could see himself lifting the cap on the payroll tax  he said   i could  but today  he's attacking me for holding the very same position  you know  john mccain has proposed a series of debates  and i'm looking forward to having them  but when it comes to social security  he might want to finish the debate with himself first  now  even if we keep social security strong for future generations  it's still not enough to help seniors who are struggling with the cost of everything from gas to groceries   because we know that rising costs are hardest for folks on fixed incomes  that's why i'll make retirement more secure by eliminating income taxes for retirees making less than   per year  this would completely eliminate income taxes for   million seniors  two of those people are ron and jane payne  who i just met before the event  since they retired  they've been spending more and more of their limited income on gas and groceries and health care premiums  this tax cut would eliminate the income taxes they pay and save them over   in contrast  john mccain believes that senior citizens living on modest incomes should continue to pay taxes  in fact  the tax cuts for the rich he is proposing would provide essentially no benefits to the vast majority of senior citizens  and it's time to end the outrage of ceos cashing out while workers lose their pensions  right now  bankruptcy laws are more focused on protecting banks than protecting pensions  and that's how john mccain wants to keep things for another four years  he voted against a proposal that would've made the claims of workers and retirees a priority in bankruptcy court   and he opposed a proposal that said companies should not unfairly cut the pension benefits of men and women who've worked their whole lives to earn them  well that's not fair  that's not the america that i believe in  it's time to stop cutting back the safety net for working people while we protect golden parachutes for the well off  if you work hard and play by the rules  then you've earned your pension  if a company goes bankrupt  then workers need to be a top priority   not an afterthought  as president  i'll limit circumstances when retirement benefits can be cut  and increase the wages and benefits that workers can claim in bankruptcy court  we'll require companies to disclose their pension fund investments  we'll put an end to the outrage of executives getting bonuses while workers watch pensions disappear  and we'll make sure that no american goes bankrupt just because they get sick  finally  we're not going to help folks reach a secure retirement unless we encourage savings  but today  personal savings is at an all time low as americans are dealing with higher costs and a credit crunch  meanwhile    million working americans don't have employer based retirement plans  that's why i've proposed automatic workplace pensions  there will be no red tape or complicated forms   employers will provide a direct deposit of a small percentage of each paycheck into your account  you can add to it  or you can opt out at any time  and employers will have an easy opportunity to match employee savings  if you switch jobs  your savings will roll over into your new employer's system  if you become self employed  you will control your account  studies show that about   percent of americans will enroll if given the option to pursue our type of plan  and we will also help middle class families start their own nest egg by matching   of the first   saved   a match that will be directly deposited into your savings account  a tax cut that will truly encouraging savings  investment and wealth creation  these steps will put a secure retirement within reach for millions of working families  since the new deal  we've had a basic understanding in america that if you work hard and pay into the system  you've earned the right to a secure retirement  that's the promise that was kept for my grandparents and michelle's parents  and for so many families here in oregon and across the country  and if we keep that promise today  we're not just valuing work and our workers  we'll be keeping our businesses and our economy strong for the next generation  that's a future worth fighting for  and with your help  that's what i will do when i am president of the united states of america "], ["obama1", "good morning  it's good to be home on this father's day with my girls  and it's an honor to spend some time with all of you today in the house of our lord  at the end of the sermon on the mount  jesus closes by saying   whoever hears these words of mine  and does them  shall be likened to a wise man who built his house upon a rock  and the rain descended  and the floods came  and the winds blew  and beat upon that house  and it fell not  for it was founded upon a rock   matthew     here at apostolic  you are blessed to worship in a house that has been founded on the rock of jesus christ  our lord and savior  but it is also built on another rock  another foundation   and that rock is bishop arthur brazier  in forty eight years  he has built this congregation from just a few hundred to more than   strong   a congregation that  because of his leadership  has braved the fierce winds and heavy rains of violence and poverty  joblessness and hopelessness  because of his work and his ministry  there are more graduates and fewer gang members in the neighborhoods surrounding this church  there are more homes and fewer homeless  there is more community and less chaos because bishop brazier continued the march for justice that he began by dr  king's side all those years ago  he is the reason this house has stood tall for half a century  and on this father's day  it must make him proud to know that the man now charged with keeping its foundation strong is his son and your new pastor  reverend byron brazier  of all the rocks upon which we build our lives  we are reminded today that family is the most important  and we are called to recognize and honor how critical every father is to that foundation  they are teachers and coaches  they are mentors and role models  they are examples of success and the men who constantly push us toward it  but if we are honest with ourselves  we'll admit that what too many fathers also are is missing   missing from too many lives and too many homes  they have abandoned their responsibilities  acting like boys instead of men  and the foundations of our families are weaker because of it  you and i know how true this is in the african american community  we know that more than half of all black children live in single parent households  a number that has doubled   doubled   since we were children  we know the statistics   that children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime  nine times more likely to drop out of schools and twenty times more likely to end up in prison  they are more likely to have behavioral problems  or run away from home  or become teenage parents themselves  and the foundations of our community are weaker because of it  how many times in the last year has this city lost a child at the hands of another child  how many times have our hearts stopped in the middle of the night with the sound of a gunshot or a siren  how many teenagers have we seen hanging around on street corners when they should be sitting in a classroom  how many are sitting in prison when they should be working  or at least looking for a job  how many in this generation are we willing to lose to poverty or violence or addiction  how many  yes  we need more cops on the street  yes  we need fewer guns in the hands of people who shouldn't have them  yes  we need more money for our schools  and more outstanding teachers in the classroom  and more afterschool programs for our children  yes  we need more jobs and more job training and more opportunity in our communities  but we also need families to raise our children  we need fathers to realize that responsibility does not end at conception  we need them to realize that what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child   it's the courage to raise one  we need to help all the mothers out there who are raising these kids by themselves  the mothers who drop them off at school  go to work  pick up them up in the afternoon  work another shift  get dinner  make lunches  pay the bills  fix the house  and all the other things it takes both parents to do  so many of these women are doing a heroic job  but they need support  they need another parent  their children need another parent  that's what keeps their foundation strong  it's what keeps the foundation of our country strong  i know what it means to have an absent father  although my circumstances weren't as tough as they are for many young people today  even though my father left us when i was two years old  and i only knew him from the letters he wrote and the stories that my family told  i was luckier than most  i grew up in hawaii  and had two wonderful grandparents from kansas who poured everything they had into helping my mother raise my sister and me   who worked with her to teach us about love and respect and the obligations we have to one another  i screwed up more often than i should've  but i got plenty of second chances  and even though we didn't have a lot of money  scholarships gave me the opportunity to go to some of the best schools in the country  a lot of kids don't get these chances today  there is no margin for error in their lives  so my own story is different in that way  still  i know the toll that being a single parent took on my mother   how she struggled at times to the pay bills  to give us the things that other kids had  to play all the roles that both parents are supposed to play  and i know the toll it took on me  so i resolved many years ago that it was my obligation to break the cycle   that if i could be anything in life  i would be a good father to my girls  that if i could give them anything  i would give them that rock   that foundation   on which to build their lives  and that would be the greatest gift i could offer  i say this knowing that i have been an imperfect father   knowing that i have made mistakes and will continue to make more  wishing that i could be home for my girls and my wife more than i am right now  i say this knowing all of these things because even as we are imperfect  even as we face difficult circumstances  there are still certain lessons we must strive to live and learn as fathers   whether we are black or white  rich or poor  from the south side or the wealthiest suburb  the first is setting an example of excellence for our children   because if we want to set high expectations for them  we've got to set high expectations for ourselves  it's great if you have a job  it's even better if you have a college degree  it's a wonderful thing if you are married and living in a home with your children  but don't just sit in the house and watch  sportscenter  all weekend long  that's why so many children are growing up in front of the television  as fathers and parents  we've got to spend more time with them  and help them with their homework  and replace the video game or the remote control with a book once in awhile  that's how we build that foundation  we know that education is everything to our children's future  we know that they will no longer just compete for good jobs with children from indiana  but children from india and china and all over the world  we know the work and the studying and the level of education that requires  you know  sometimes i'll go to an eighth grade graduation and there's all that pomp and circumstance and gowns and flowers  and i think to myself  it's just eighth grade  to really compete  they need to graduate high school  and then they need to graduate college  and they probably need a graduate degree too  an eighth grade education doesn't cut it today  let's give them a handshake and tell them to get their butts back in the library  it's up to us   as fathers and parents   to instill this ethic of excellence in our children  it's up to us to say to our daughters  don't ever let images on tv tell you what you are worth  because i expect you to dream without limit and reach for those goals  it's up to us to tell our sons  those songs on the radio may glorify violence  but in my house we live glory to achievement  self respect  and hard work  it's up to us to set these high expectations  and that means meeting those expectations ourselves  that means setting examples of excellence in our own lives  the second thing we need to do as fathers is pass along the value of empathy to our children  not sympathy  but empathy   the ability to stand in somebody else's shoes  to look at the world through their eyes  sometimes it's so easy to get caught up in  us  that we forget about our obligations to one another  there's a culture in our society that says remembering these obligations is somehow soft   that we can't show weakness  and so therefore we can't show kindness  but our young boys and girls see that  they see when you are ignoring or mistreating your wife  they see when you are inconsiderate at home  or when you are distant  or when you are thinking only of yourself  and so it's no surprise when we see that behavior in our schools or on our streets  that's why we pass on the values of empathy and kindness to our children by living them  we need to show our kids that you're not strong by putting other people down   you're strong by lifting them up  that's our responsibility as fathers  and by the way   it's a responsibility that also extends to washington  because if fathers are doing their part  if they're taking our responsibilities seriously to be there for their children  and set high expectations for them  and instill in them a sense of excellence and empathy  then our government should meet them halfway  we should be making it easier for fathers who make responsible choices and harder for those who avoid them  we should get rid of the financial penalties we impose on married couples right now  and start making sure that every dime of child support goes directly to helping children instead of some bureaucrat  we should reward fathers who pay that child support with job training and job opportunities and a larger earned income tax credit that can help them pay the bills  we should expand programs where registered nurses visit expectant and new mothers and help them learn how to care for themselves before the baby is born and what to do after   programs that have helped increase father involvement  women's employment  and children's readiness for school  we should help these new families care for their children by expanding maternity and paternity leave  and we should guarantee every worker more paid sick leave so they can stay home to take care of their child without losing their income  we should take all of these steps to build a strong foundation for our children  but we should also know that even if we do  even if we meet our obligations as fathers and parents  even if washington does its part too  we will still face difficult challenges in our lives  there will still be days of struggle and heartache  the rains will still come and the winds will still blow  and that is why the final lesson we must learn as fathers is also the greatest gift we can pass on to our children   and that is the gift of hope  i'm not talking about an idle hope that's little more than blind optimism or willful ignorance of the problems we face  i'm talking about hope as that spirit inside us that insists  despite all evidence to the contrary  that something better is waiting for us if we're willing to work for it and fight for it  if we are willing to believe  i was answering questions at a town hall meeting in wisconsin the other day and a young man raised his hand  and i figured he'd ask about college tuition or energy or maybe the war in iraq  but instead he looked at me very seriously and he asked   what does life mean to you  now  i have to admit that i wasn't quite prepared for that one  i think i stammered for a little bit  but then i stopped and gave it some thought  and i said this  when i was a young man  i thought life was all about me   how do i make my way in the world  and how do i become successful and how do i get the things that i want  but now  my life revolves around my two little girls  and what i think about is what kind of world i'm leaving them  are they living in a county where there's a huge gap between a few who are wealthy and a whole bunch of people who are struggling every day  are they living in a county that is still divided by race  a country where  because they're girls  they don't have as much opportunity as boys do  are they living in a country where we are hated around the world because we don't cooperate effectively with other nations  are they living a world that is in grave danger because of what we've done to its climate  and what i've realized is that life doesn't count for much unless you're willing to do your small part to leave our children   all of our children   a better world  even if it's difficult  even if the work seems great  even if we don't get very far in our lifetime  that is our ultimate responsibility as fathers and parents  we try  we hope  we do what we can to build our house upon the sturdiest rock  and when the winds come  and the rains fall  and they beat upon that house  we keep faith that our father will be there to guide us  and watch over us  and protect us  and lead his children through the darkest of storms into light of a better day  that is my prayer for all of us on this father's day  and that is my hope for this country in the years ahead  may god bless you and your children  thank you "], ["obama1", "it's great to be at kettering   a university that is teaching the next generation of leaders  and training workers to have the skills they need to advance their own careers and communities for months  the state of our economy has dominated the headlines   and the news hasn't been good  the sub prime lending debacle has sent the housing market into a tailspin  and caused a broader contraction in the credit markets  over   jobs have been lost this year  with the unemployment rate registering the biggest one month jump since february   incomes have failed to keep pace with the rising costs of health insurance and college  and record oil and food prices have left families struggling just to keep up of course  grim economic news is nothing new to flint  manufacturing jobs have been leaving here for decades now  the jobs that have replaced them pay less  and offer fewer  if any benefits  hard working americans who could once count on a single paycheck to support their families have not only lost jobs  but their health care and their pensions as well  worst of all  many have lost confidence in that fundamental american promise that our children will have a better life than we do so these are challenging times  that's why i spent last week talking about immediate steps we need to take to provide working americans with relief  a broad based  middle class tax cut  to help offset the rising cost of gas and food  a foreclosure prevention fund  to help stabilize the housing market  a health care plan that lowers costs and gives those without health insurance the same kind of coverage members of congress have  a commitment to retirement security that stabilizes social security  and provides workers a means to increase savings  and a plan to crack down on unfair and sometimes deceptive lending in the credit card and housing markets  to help families climb out of crippling debt  and stay out of debt in the first place these steps are all paid for  and designed to restore balance and fairness to the american economy after years of bush administration policies that tilted the playing field in favor of the wealthy and the well connected  but the truth is  none of these short term steps alone will ensure america's future  yes  we have to make sure that the economic pie is sliced more fairly  but we also have to make sure that the economic pie is growing  yes  we need to provide immediate help to families who are struggling in places like flint  but we also need a serious plan to create new jobs and industry we can't simply return to the strategies of the past  for we are living through an age of fundamental economic transformation  technology has changed the way we live and the way the world does business  the collapse of the soviet union and the advance of capitalism have vanquished old challenges to america's global leadership  but new challenges have emerged  from china and india  eastern europe and brazil  jobs and industries can move to any country with an internet connection and willing workers

to google's headquarters in california  toward the end of my tour  i was brought into a room where a three dimensional image of the earth rotated on a large flat panel monitor  across this image  there were countless lights in different colors  a young engineer explained that the lights represented all of the internet searches taking place across the world  and each color represented a different language  the image was mesmerizing   a picture of a world where old boundaries are disappearing  a world where communication  connection  and competition can come from anywhere there are some who believe that we must try to turn back the clock on this new world  that the only chance to maintain our living standards is to build a fortress around america  to stop trading with other countries  shut down immigration  and rely on old industries  i disagree  not only is it impossible to turn back the tide of globalization  but efforts to do so can make us worse off rather than fear the future  we must embrace it  i have no doubt that america can compete   and succeed   in the  st century  and i know as well that more than anything else  success will depend not on our government  but on the dynamism  determination  and innovation of the american people  here in flint  it was the private sector that helped turn lumber into the wagons that sent this country west  that built the tanks that faced down fascism  and that turned out the automobiles that were the cornerstone of america's manufacturing boom but at critical moments of transition like this one  success has also depended on national leadership that moved the country forward with confidence and a common purpose  that's what our founding fathers did after winning independence  when they tied together the economies of the thirteen states and created the american market  that's what lincoln did in the midst of civil war  when he pushed for a transcontinental railroad  incorporated our national academy of sciences  passed the homestead act  and created our system of land grant colleges  that's what fdr did in confronting capitalism's gravest crisis  when he forged the social safety net  built the hoover dam  created the tennessee valley authority  and invested in an arsenal of democracy  and that's what kennedy did in the dark days of the cold war  when he called us to a new frontier  created the apollo program  and put us on a pathway to the moon this was leadership that had the strength to turn moments of adversity into opportunity  the wisdom to see a little further down the road  and the courage to challenge conventional thinking and worn ideas so that we could reinvent our economy to seize the future  that's not the kind of leadership that we have seen out of washington recently  but that's the kind of leadership i intend to provide as president of the united states these past eight years will be remembered for misguided policies  missed opportunities  and a rigid and ideological adherence to discredited ideas  almost a decade into this century  we still have no real strategy to compete in a global economy  just think of what we could have done  we could have made a real commitment to a world class education for our kids  but instead we passed  no child left behind  a law that   however well intended   left the money behind and alienated teachers and principals instead of inspiring them  we could have done something to end our addiction to oil  but instead we continued down a path that that funds both sides of the war on terror  endangers our planet  and has left americans struggling with four dollar a gallon gasoline  we could have invested in innovation and rebuilt our crumbling roads and bridges  but instead we've spent hundreds of billions of dollars fighting a war in iraq that should've never been authorized and never been waged worse yet  the price tag for these failures is being passed to our children  the clinton administration left behind a surplus  but this administration squandered it  we face budget deficits in the hundreds of billions and our nearly ten trillion dollars in debt  we've borrowed billions from countries like china to finance needless tax cuts for the wealthiest americans and an unnecessary war  and yet senator mccain is explicitly running to continue and expand these policies  without a realistic plan to pay for it the pundits talk about two debates   one on national security and one on the economy   but they miss the point  we didn't win the cold war just because of the strength of our military  we also prevailed because of the vigor of our economy and the endurance of our ideals  in this century  we won't be secure if we bankroll terrorists and dictators through our dependence on oil  we won't be safe if we can't count on our infrastructure  we won't extend the promise of american greatness unless we invest in our young people and ask them to invest in america so there is a clear choice in this election  instead of reaching for new horizons  george bush has put us in a hole  and john mccain's policies will keep us there  i want to take us in a new and better direction  i reject the belief that we should either shrink from the challenge of globalization  or fall back on the same tired and failed approaches of the last eight years  it's time for new policies that create the jobs and opportunities of the future  a competitiveness agenda built upon education and energy  innovation and infrastructure  fair trade and reform this agenda starts with education  whether you're conservative or liberal  republican or democrat  practically every economist agrees that in this digital age  a highly educated and skilled workforce will be the key not only to individual opportunity  but to the overall success of our economy as well  we cannot be satisfied until every child in america   and i mean every child   has the same chances for a good education that we want for our own children and yet  despite this consensus  we continually fail to deliver  a few years ago  i visited a high school outside chicago  the number one concern i heard from those students was that the school district couldn't afford to keep teachers for a full day  so school let out at   every afternoon  that cut out critical classes like science and labs  imagine that   these kids wanted more school  they knew they were being short changed  unfortunately  stories like this can be found across america  only   percent of students are prepared to take college classes in english  math and science  we have one of the highest dropout rates of any industrialized nation  and barely one tenth of our low income students will graduate from college  that will cripple their ability to keep pace in this global economy  and compromise our ability to compete as a nation senator mccain doesn't talk about education much  but i don't accept the status quo  it is morally unacceptable and economically untenable  it's time to make an historic commitment to education  a real commitment that will require new resources and new reforms we can start by investing   billion to guarantee access to quality  affordable  early childhood education for every child in america  every dollar that we spend on these programs puts our children on a path to success  while saving us as much as   in reduced health care costs  crime  and welfare later on we can fix the failures of no child left behind  while focusing on accountability  that means providing the funding that was promised  more importantly  it means reaching high standards  but not by relying on a single  high stakes standardized test that distorts how teachers teach  instead  we need to work with governors  educators and especially teachers to develop better assessment tools that effectively measure student achievement  and encourage the kinds of research  scientific investigation  and problem solving that our children will need to compete  and we need to recruit an army of new teachers  i'll make this pledge as president   if you commit your life to teaching  america will pay for your college education  we'll recruit teachers in math and science  and deploy them to under staffed school districts in our inner cities and rural america  we'll expand mentoring programs that pair experienced teachers with new recruits  and when our teachers succeed  i won't just talk about how great they are   i'll reward their greatness with better pay and more support but research shows that resources alone won't create the schools that we need to help our children succeed  we also need to encourage innovation   by adopting curricula and the school calendar to the needs of the  st century  by updating the schools of education that produce most of our teachers  by welcoming charter schools within the public schools system  and streamlining the certification process for engineers or businesspeople who want to shift careers and teach  we must also challenge the system that prevents us from promoting and rewarding excellence in teaching  we cannot ask our teachers to perform the impossible   to teach poorly prepared children with inadequate resources  and then punish them when children perform poorly on a standardized test  but if we give teachers the resources they need  if we pay them more  and give them time for professional development  if they are given ownership over the design of better assessment tools and a creative curricula  if we shape reforms with teachers rather than imposing changes on teachers  then it is fair to expect better results  where there are teachers who are still struggling and underperforming  we should provide them with individual help and support  and if they're still underperforming after that  we should find a quick and fair way to put another teacher in that classroom  our children deserve no less finally  our commitment cannot end with a high school degree  the chance to get a college education must not be a privilege of the few   it should be a birthright of every single american  senator mccain is campaigning on a plan to give more tax breaks to corporations  i want to give tax breaks to young people  in the form of an annual   tax credit that will cover two thirds of the tuition at an average public college  and make community college completely free  in return  i will ask students to serve  whether it's by teaching  joining the peace corps  or working in your community  and for those who serve in our military  we'll cover all of your tuition with an even more generous  st century gi bill  the idea is simple   america invests in you  and you invest in america  that's how we're going to ensure that america succeeds in this century reforming our education system will require sustained effort from all of us   parents and teachers  federal  state and local governments  the same is true for the second leg of our competitiveness agenda   a bold and sustainable energy policy in the past  america has been stirred to action when a new challenge threatened our national security  that was true when german and japanese armies advanced across europe and asia  or when the soviets launched sputnik  the energy threat we face today may be less direct  but it is real  our dependence on foreign oil strains family budgets and saps our economy  oil money pays for the bombs going off from baghdad to beirut  and the bombast of dictators from caracas to tehran  our nation will not be secure unless we take that leverage away  and our planet will not be safe unless we move decisively toward a clean energy future the dangers are eclipsed only by the opportunities that would come with change  we know the jobs of the  st century will be created in developing alternative energy  the question is whether these jobs will be created in america  or abroad  already  we've seen countries like germany  spain and brazil reap the benefits of economic growth from clean energy  but we are decades behind in confronting this challenge  george bush has spent most of his administration denying that we have a problem  and making deals with big oil behind closed doors  and while john mccain deserves credit for speaking out against the threat of climate change  his rhetoric is undercut by a record of voting time and again against important investments in renewable energyit's time to make energy security a leading priority  my energy plan will invest   billion over the next ten years to establish a green energy sector that will create up to   million jobs over the next two decades  good jobs  like the ones i saw in pennsylvania where workers make wind turbines  or the jobs that will be created when plug in hybrids or electric cars start rolling off the assembly line here in michigan  we'll help manufacturers   particularly in the auto industry   convert to green technology  and  help workers learn the skills they need  and unlike george bush  i won't wait until the sixth year of my presidency to sit down with the automakers  i'll meet with them during my campaign  and i'll meet with them as president to talk about how we're going to build the cars of the future right here in michigan and when i'm president  we will invest in research and development of every form of alternative energy   solar  wind  and biofuels  as well as technologies that can make coal clean and nuclear power safe  we will provide incentives to businesses and consumers to save energy and make buildings more efficient  that's how we're going to create jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  that's how we're going to win back control of our own destiny from oil rich dictators  and that's how we'll solve the problem of   a gallon gas   not with another washington gimmick like john mccain's gas tax holiday that would pad oil company profits while draining the highway fund that michigan depends on moreover  our commitment to manufacturing cannot end with green jobs  that's why i'll end tax breaks that ship jobs overseas  and invest in american jobs  senator mccain has a different view  he's voted to keep tax incentives that encourage companies to move abroad  he should listen to leaders in michigan like carl levin  who have put forward serious proposals to address the crisis in manufacturing  we need to support programs like michigan's  st century jobs fund  and build on best practices across the country  that's why i'll create an advanced manufacturing fund to invest in places hit hard by job loss  i'll partner with community colleges  so that we're training workers to meet the demands of local industry and we can't just focus on preserving existing industries  we have to be in the business of encouraging new ones   and that means science  research and technology  for two centuries  america led the world in innovation  but this administration's hostility to science has taken a toll  at a time when technology is shaping our future  we devote a smaller and smaller share of our national resources to research and development  it's time for america to lead  i'll double federal funding for basic research  and make the r amp d tax credit permanent  we can ensure that the discoveries of the  st century happen in america   in our labs and universities  at places like kettering and the university of michigan  wayne state and michigan state encouraging new industry also means giving more support to american entrepreneurs  the other day  senator mccain gave a speech to the small business summit where he attacked my plan to provide tax relief for the middle class  what he didn't say is that i've also proposed exempting all start up companies from capital gains taxes  in other words  john mccain would tax them  i won't  we'll work  at every juncture  to remove bureaucratic barriers for small and startup businesses   for example  by making the patent process more efficient and reliable  and we'll help with technical support to do everything we can to make sure the next google or microsoft is started here in america and we know that america won't be able to compete if skyrocketing costs cause companies like the big three to spend   on health care for every car  and condemn millions of americans to the risk of no coverage  that's why we need to commit ourselves to electronic medical records that enhance care while lowering costs  we need to invest in biomedical research and stem cell research  so that we're at the leading edge of prevention and treatment  and we need to finally pass universal health care so that every american has access to health insurance that they can afford  and our getting the preventive services that are the key to cutting health care costs  that's what i pledge to do in my first term as president a third part of our agenda must be a commitment to  st century infrastructure  if we want to keep up with china or europe  we can't settle for crumbling roads and bridges  aging water and sewer pipes  and faltering electrical grids that cost us billions to blackouts  repairs and travel delays  it's gotten so bad that the american society of civil engineers gave our national infrastructure a  d  a century ago  teddy roosevelt called together leaders from business and government to develop a plan for  th century infrastructure  it falls to us to do the same as president  i will launch a national infrastructure reinvestment bank that will invest   billion over ten years   a bank that can leverage private investment in infrastructure improvements  and create nearly two million new jobs  the work will be determined by what will maximize our safety and security and ability to compete  we will fund this bank as we bring the war in iraq to a responsible close  it's time to stop spending billions of dollars a week on a blank check for an iraqi government that won't spend its own oil revenues  it's time to strengthen transportation and to protect vulnerable targets from terrorism at home  we can modernize our power grid  which will help conservation and spur on the development and distribution of clean energy  we can invest in rail  so that cities like detroit  chicago  milwaukee and st  louis are connected by high speed trains  and folks have alternatives to air travel  that's what we can do if we commit to rebuild a stronger america as part of this commitment to infrastructure  we need to upgrade our digital superhighway as well  when i looked at that map of the world mounted on the screen at google  i was struck at first by the light generated by internet searches coming from every corner of the earth  but then i was struck by the darkness  huge chunks of africa and parts of asia where the light of the information revolution has yet to shine  and then i noticed portions of the united states where the thick cords of light dissolved into a few discrete strands it is unacceptable that here  in the country that invented the internet  we fell to  th in the world in broadband deployment  when kids in downtown flint or rural iowa can't afford or access high speed internet  that sets back america's ability to compete  as president  i will set a simple goal  every american should have the highest speed broadband access   no matter where you live  or how much money you have  we'll connect schools  libraries and hospitals  and we'll take on special interests to unleash the power of wireless spectrum for our safety and connectivity a revamped education system  a bold new energy strategy  a more efficient health care system  renewed investment in basic research and our infrastructure  these are the pillars of a more competitive economy that will take advantage of the global marketplace's opportunities but even as we welcome competition  we need to remember that our economic policies must be supported by strong and smart trade policies  i have said before  and will say again   i believe in free trade  it can save money for our consumers  generate business for u s  exporters  and expand global wealth  but unlike george bush and john mccain  i do not think that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement  i don't think an agreement that allows south korea to import hundreds of thousands of cars into the u s  but continues to restrict u s  car exports into south korea to a few thousand  is a smart deal  i don't think that trade agreements without labor or environmental agreements are in our long term interestsif we continue to let our trade policy be dictated by special interests  then american workers will continue to be undermined  and public support for robust trade will continue to erode  that might make sense to the washington lobbyists who run senator mccain's campaign  but it won't help our nation compete  allowing subsidized and unfairly traded products to flood our markets is not free trade and it's not fair to the people of michigan  we cannot stand by while countries manipulate currencies to promote exports  creating huge imbalances in the global economy  we cannot let foreign regulatory policies exclude american products  we cannot let enforcement of existing trade agreements take a backseat to the negotiation of new ones  put simply  we need tougher negotiators on our side of the table   to strike bargains that are good not just for wall street  but also for main street  and when i am president  that's what we will do finally  let me say a word about fiscal responsibility  i recognize that my agenda is ambitious   particularly in light of bush administration fiscal policies that have run up the national debt by over   trillion  entitlement spending is bound to increase as the baby boom generation retires  but the answer to our fiscal problems is not to continue to short change investments in education  energy  innovation and infrastructure   investments that are vital to long term growth  instead  we need to end the iraq war  eliminate waste in existing government programs  generate revenue by charging polluters for the greenhouse gases they are sending into our atmosphere   and put an end to the reckless  special interest driven corporate loopholes and tax cuts for the wealthy that have been the centerpiece of the bush administration's economic policy john mccain wants to double down on george bush's disastrous policies   not only by making permanent the bush tax cuts for the wealthy  but by   billion in new tax cuts that give a quarter of their revenue to households making over   million  worse yet  he hasn't detailed how he would pay for this new give away  there is nothing fiscally conservative about this approach  it will continue to drive up deficits  force us to borrow massively from foreign countries  and shift the burden on to working people today and our children tomorrow  meanwhile  john mccain will shortchange investments in education  energy and innovation  making the next generation of americans less able to compete  that's unacceptable  it's time to make tough choices so that we have a smarter government that pays its way and makes the right investments for america's future it falls to us to shape a new century  every aspect of our government should be under review  we can ill afford needless layers of bureaucracy and outmoded programs  my administration will open up the doors of democracy  we'll put government data online  and use technology to shine a light on spending  we'll invite the service and participation of american citizens  and cut through the red tape to make sure that every agency is meeting cutting edge standards  we'll make it clear to the special interests that their days of setting the agenda in washington are over  because the american people are not the problem in this  st century   they are the answer we have a choice  we can continue the bush status quo   as senator mccain wants to do   and we will become a country in which few reap the benefits of the global economy  while a growing number work harder for less and depend upon an overburdened public sector  an america in which we run up deficits and expose ourselves to the whims of oil rich dictators while the opportunities for our children and grandchildren shrink  that is one course we could take  or  we can rise together  if we choose to change  just imagine what we can do  the great manufacturers of the  th century can turn out cars that run on renewable energy in the  st  biotechnology labs can find new cures  new rail lines and roadways can connect our communities  goods made here in michigan can be exported around the world  our children can get a world class education  and their dreams of tomorrow can eclipse even our greatest hopes of today we can choose to rise together  but it won't be easy  every one of us will have to work at it by studying harder  training more rigorously  working smarter  and thinking anew  we'll have to slough off bad habits  reform our institutions  and re engage the world  we can do that  because this is america   a country that has been defined by a determination to believe in  and work for  things unseen every so often  there are times when america must rise to meet a moment  so it has been for the generations that built the railroads and beat back the depression  that worked on the first assembly line and that went to the moon  so it must be for us today  this is our moment  this is our time to unite in common purpose  to make this century the next american century  because when americans come together  there is no destiny too difficult or too distant for us to reach "], ["obama1", "thank you  marilyn  it isn't right that you're working so hard and struggling so much just to pay your college tuition  and that's why we're here today   to talk about what we can do to make college affordable and help every american get a college education  for so many generations  college has been the passport to a better future  my own father   like so many immigrants   crossed an ocean to reach the promise of an american college education  and like so many kids who didn't come from money or status  a college education is what helped michelle and me reach a little further than our own parents  you see  i wasn't born with a lot of advantages  i had a teenage mom and a dad who left us when i was two  but i was given love  and support  and an education that put me on a pathway to my dreams  the same was true for michelle  she came from a simple  blue collar family on the south side of chicago  even though he had multiple sclerosis  michelle's father went to work every day at the local water filtration plant to support his family  and michelle and her brother were able to go to a great college  and to reach a little further for their dreams  unfortunately  another thing that michelle and i have in common is that we left school with a mountain of debt  we didn't finish paying off our student loans until just a few years ago  like a lot of families  we were still dealing with the cost of our own education when we had to start worrying about how we'd save for school for our girls  it's something that plays out in households all across this country   the high cost of tuition is making college a dream that is slipping out of reach for far too many americans  folks who've been working for years want to go back and get a degree  but they have to choose between going to class and paying the rent  many young people have the talent to go to school  but can't afford to be saddled with debt  college costs have gone up almost   percent in the last five years  i do not accept an america where you can't achieve your potential because you can't afford it  where   million qualified students will pass up college this decade because they can't afford it  now  this isn't an issue you'll hear senator mccain talk about that much  because when it comes to education  senator mccain is out of touch with the needs of hardworking americans  it's not just that he doesn't have a real plan to make college affordable  it's that he's voted time and time again to stop us from making college affordable  a couple of years ago  he even voted against funding for students so he could protect billions of dollars in corporate tax loopholes  well  that's not the kind of change that people here in michigan are looking for  that's not the kind of change that will strengthen our middle class and make america more competitive  and that's why the american people will have a clear choice in november   because when i'm president  i will make college affordable for every american  to reach that goal  i've proposed an annual  fully refundable american opportunity tax credit of   for americans who need a hand with tuition and fees  this will cover two thirds of tuition at the average public college or university  and will make tuition free and help cover expenses for students to go to a community college like wayne county community college  but when we invest in your future  we're going to ask you to invest in the future of your country  to receive this credit  we'll require   hours of public service   you'll have to work at a veteran's hospital or nursing home  join an americorps program or work in a local school  you get a hand living your dreams  and then you help your fellow citizens live theirs   that's how we're going to move this country forward  that how we're going to come together behind a common purpose  we also have to reform the system that governs how student loans are handed out  recently there's been concern about problems in our credit markets spilling over into student loans  in fact  a number of universities and communities colleges have seen their lenders withdraw from the federal student loan program  including wayne county community college  and we've seen some big banks go so far as to continue making loans to students at some  year colleges  while denying them to students at community colleges  so far  this hasn't affected students or schools in serious way   because other lenders have stepped up and congress has taken steps to ensure that students have the money they need this fall  but it has been a reminder that we need to make sure students can always get the loans they need  that's why i've called for strengthening our federal student loan programs  in an obama administration  we'll stop giving subsidies to banks that can just walk away from students in tough times  and we'll stop tolerating a system where private lenders can discriminate against students at community colleges  instead  we'll require all federal student loans to be provided directly by the federal government  this one step will help protect students  restore fairness to the system  and save billions of dollars a year  we also need to make sure our current assistance keeps pace with costs  the first bill i introduced in the senate aimed to increase the maximum pell grant  and we went on to work in a bipartisan way to get it done  as president  i'll make sure we keep pace with costs so that students like some of you here today don't fall behind  we also need to simplify the process  you shouldn't need a phd to apply for financial aid  but the process is so complex that it shuts out hundreds of thousands of students  so i'll eliminate the current student aid form altogether   we'll use tax data instead  as we move forward  we cannot neglect our community colleges  these schools produce the backbone of our workforce  nurses and firefighters  computer programmers and farmers  and as our changing economy demands a more skilled workforce  america's community colleges must be at the forefront of our approach to higher education and economic competitiveness  eighty percent of america's fastest growing jobs require at least a  year degree  you and i know this  businesses know this  yet for too long  washington has treated community colleges as a stepchild of the higher education system  instead of essential resources for training and preparing the workers of tomorrow  that's why i'll create a new community college partnership program to give you the skills you need to compete  this initiative will help community colleges analyze what skills are needed to prepare students to work in local industry  here in michigan  that means making sure that our manufacturing workers can get the training they need to work in green energy jobs and build the cars of the future  and we won't just encourage schools to move in this direction   we'll reward success by providing grants to community colleges that graduate more students  and increase the number of their students who transfer to four year colleges  this is fundamental to the future of our country  our economy is changing at a breathtaking pace  you need different skills to make a good living than you did twenty years ago  as folks in michigan know all too well  young people today will be competing throughout their lives with people halfway around the world   in beijing and bangalore  japan and south korea  we cannot let the doors of opportunity close because we couldn't come together to lower the cost of college and extend the promise of our community colleges  it's time to put the american dream within reach for all americans  regardless of ethnic or economic background  that is our cause in this campaign  and that is the future we can build together if you join me in november "], ["obama1", "this is something of a homecoming for me  because while i stand here today as a candidate for president of the united states  i will never forget that the most important experience in my life came when i was doing what you do each day   working at the local level to bring about change in our communities  as some of you may know  after college  i went to work with a group of churches as a community organizer in chicago   so i could help lift up neighborhoods that were struggling after the local steel plants closed  and it taught me a fundamental truth that i carry with me to this day   that in this country  change comes not from the top down  but from the bottom up  you see  back in those days  we weren't just focused on changing federal policies in washington  and we weren't just focused on changing state policies in springfield  no  we were focused on the place we knew could actually do the most  the fastest  to make a difference in our community   and that was the mayor's office  it was the mayor's office we turned to when we wanted to open a job training center to put people back to work  it was the mayor's office we turned to when we wanted to make sure city housing was safe to live in  and it's the mayors office that americans across this country rely on every day  you may get more than your fair share of the blame sometimes  you may not always be appreciated  but when a disaster strikes   a katrina  a shooting  or a six alarm blaze   it's city hall we lean on  it's city hall we call first  and city hall we depend on to get us through tough times  because whether it's a small town or a big city  the government that people count on most is the one that's closest to the people  and it's precisely because you're on the front lines in our communities that you know what happens when washington fails to do its job  it may be easy for some in washington to remain out of touch with the consequences of the decisions that are made there   but not you  you know what happens when washington puts out economic policies that work for wall street but not main street   because it's your towns and cities that get hit when factories close their doors  and workers lose their jobs  and families lose their homes because of an unscrupulous lender  that's why you need a partner in the white house  you know what happens when washington makes promises it doesn't keep and fails to fully fund no child left behind   because it's your teachers who are overburdened  your teachers who aren't getting the support they need  and your teachers who are forced to teach to the test  instead of giving students the skills to compete in our global economy  that's why you need a partner in the white house  you know what happens when washington succumbs to petty partisanship and fails to pass comprehensive immigration reform   because it's your communities that are forced to take immigration enforcement into their own hands  your cities' services that are stretched  and your neighborhoods that are seeing rising cultural and economic tensions  that's why you need a partner in the white house  you know what happens when washington listens to big oil and gas companies and blocks real energy reform   because it's your budgets that are being pinched by high energy costs  and your schools that are cutting back on textbooks to keep their buses running  it's the lots in your towns and cities that are brownfields  that's why you need a partner in the white house  now  despite the absence of leadership in washington  we're actually seeing a rebirth in many places  i'm thinking of my friend rich daley  who's made a deep and lasting difference in the quality of life for millions of chicagoans  i'm thinking of mayor cownie  who's working to make his city green  mayor bloomberg  who's fighting to turn around the nation's largest school system  mayor rybak  who's done an extraordinary job helping the twin cities recover from the bridge collapse last year  and so many other mayors across this country  who are finding new ways to lift up their communities  but you shouldn't be succeeding despite washington   you should be succeeding with a hand from washington  neglect is not a policy for america's metropolitan areas  it's time city hall had someone in the white house you could count on the way so many americans count on you  that's what this election is all about   because while senator mccain is a true patriot  he won't be that partner  his priorities are very different from yours and mine  at a time when you're facing budget deficits and looking to washington for the support you need  he isn't proposing a strategy for america's cities  instead  he's calling for nearly   trillion in tax breaks for big corporations and the wealthiest americans   and yet he's actually opposed more funding for the cops program and the community development block grant program  that's just more of the same in washington  and few know better than you why washington needs to change  but the truth is  what our cities need isn't just a partner  what you need is a partner who knows that the old ways of looking at our cities just won't do  who knows that our nation and our cities are undergoing a historic transformation  the change that's taking place today is as great as any we've seen in more than a century  since the time when cities grew upward and outward with immigrants escaping poverty  and tyranny  and misery abroad  our population has grown by tens of millions in the past few decades  and it's projected to grow nearly   more in the decades to come  and this growth isn't just confined to our cities  it's happening in our suburbs  exurbs  and throughout our metropolitan areas  this is creating new pressures  but it's also opening up new opportunities   because it's not just our cities that are hotbeds of innovation anymore  it's those growing metro areas  it's not just durham or raleigh   it's the entire research triangle  it's not just palo alto  it's cities up and down silicon valley  the top   metro areas generate two thirds of our jobs  nearly   of patents  and handle   of all seaport tonnage through ports like the one here in miami  in fact    of our metro areas now rank among the world's   largest economies  to seize the possibility of this moment  we need to promote strong cities as the backbone of regional growth  and yet  washington remains trapped in an earlier era  wedded to an outdated  urban  agenda that focuses exclusively on the problems in our cities  and ignores our growing metro areas  an agenda that confuses anti poverty policy with a metropolitan strategy  and ends up hurting both  now  let me be clear   we must help tackle areas of concentrated poverty  i say this not just as a former community organizer  but as someone who was shaped in part by the economic inequality i saw as a college student in cities like los angeles and new york  that is why i've laid out an ambitious urban poverty plan that will help make sure no child begins the race of life behind the starting line  and create public private business incubators to open up economic opportunity  that's why i'll fully fund the cops program  restore funding for the community development block grant program  and recruit more teachers to our cities  and pay them more  and give them more support  and that's why i've proposed real relief for struggling homeowners and a trust fund to provide affordable housing  and let me say this   if george bush carries out his threat to veto the housing bill   a bill that would provide critical resources to help you solve the foreclosure crisis in your towns and cities   i will fight to overturn his veto and make sure you have the support you need  so  yes we need to fight poverty  yes  we need to fight crime  yes  we need to strengthen our cities  but we also need to stop seeing our cities as the problem and start seeing them as the solution  because strong cities are the building blocks of strong regions  and strong regions are essential for a strong america  that is the new metropolitan reality and we need a new strategy that reflects it   a strategy that's about south florida as much as miami  that's about mesa and scottsdale as much as phoenix  that's about stamford and northern new jersey as much as new york city  as president  i'll work with you to develop this kind of strategy and i'll appoint the first white house director of urban policy to help make it a reality  the stakes could not be higher  our children will grow up competing with children in beijing and bangalore and berlin  and make no mistake   their governments are doing everything they can to give their countries an edge by investing in regional growth  as bruce katz of brookings has pointed out  china is developing an advanced network of ports and freight hubs  and an advanced network of universities modeled after our own  and germany has launched rail and telecom projects to bind its major metro areas more closely together  other governments are aggressively pursuing strategies to unlock the potential of their metro areas  to compete and win in our global economy  we have to show the same kind of leadership  there's no better place to start than by investing in the clusters of growth and innovation that are springing up across this country  because what we've found time and time again is that when we take the different assets that are scattered throughout our communities   whether it's a skilled workforce or leading firms or institutions of higher education   and bring them all together so they can learn from one another and share ideas  you get the kind of creative thinking that doesn't come in isolation  and that can lead to more innovation  and entrepreneurship  and real economic benefits like new jobs and higher wages  that's what happened pennsylvania  where something called keystone innovation zones have led to the formation of nearly   new companies  and that's why  in my administration  we'll offer   million a year in competitive matching grants for state and local governments to plan and grow regional economies   because when it's working together  the sum of a metro area can be greater than its parts  and we won't just unlock the potential of our individual regions  we'll unlock the potential of all our regions by connecting them with a  st century infrastructure  you know why this is so important  you see the traffic along i  in miami  you see the crumbling roads and bridges  the aging water and sewer pipes  the faltering electrical grids that cost us billions in blackouts  repairs  and travel delays  it's gotten so bad that the american society of civil engineers gave our national infrastructure a  d  and it's no wonder   because we're spending less on our infrastructure than at any time in the modern era  this is putting enormous pressure on the highway trust fund  which can no longer keep up with all the repairs that have to be made  yet senator mccain is actually proposing a gas tax gimmick that would take   billion a month out of the highway trust fund and hand it over to the oil companies  well  at a time when the highway trust fund is beginning to run a deficit for the first time in history  i think that's the last thing we can afford to do  and just the other day  senator mccain traveled to iowa to express his sympathies for the victims of the recent flooding  i'm sure they appreciated the sentiment  but they probably would have appreciated it more if he hadn't voted against funding for levees and flood control programs  which he seems to consider pork  well  we do have to reform budget earmarks  cut genuine pork  and dispense with unnecessary spending  as we confront a budget crisis left by the most fiscally irresponsible administration in modern times  but when it comes to rebuilding america's essential but crumbling infrastructure  we need to do more  not less  cities across the midwest are under water right now or courting disaster not just because of the weather  but because we've failed to protect them  maintaining our levees and dams isn't pork barrel spending  it's an urgent priority  and that's what we'll do when i'm president  i'll also launch a national infrastructure reinvestment bank that will invest   billion over ten years  and create nearly two million new jobs  the work will be determined by what will maximize our safety  security  and shared prosperity  instead of building bridges to nowhere  let's build communities that meet the needs and reflect the dreams of our families  that's what this bank will help us do  and we will fund this bank as we bring the war in iraq to a responsible close  it's time to stop fighting a war that's stretching our guard  straining our reserves  and leaving your police and fire stations understaffed  a war that hasn't made us safer  and should have never been authorized and never been waged  it's time to stop spending   billion a month in iraq and start investing that money in phoenix  nashville  seattle  and metro areas across this country  let's invest that money in a world class transit system  let's re commit federal dollars to strengthen mass transit and reform our tax code to give folks a reason to take the bus instead of driving to work   because investing in mass transit helps make metro areas more livable and can help our regional economies grow  and while we're at it  we'll partner with our mayors to invest in green energy technology and ensure that your buses and buildings are energy efficient  and we'll also invest in our ports  roads  and high speed rails   because i don't want to see the fastest train in the world built halfway around the world in shanghai  i want to see it built right here in the united states of america  and let's also upgrade our digital superhighway  it is unacceptable that here  in the country that invented the internet  we fell to  th in the world in broadband deployment  when kids can't afford or access high speed internet  it sets back america's ability to compete  that's why as president  i will set a simple goal  every american should have broadband access   no matter where you live  or how much money you have  we'll connect our schools and libraries and hospitals  and we'll take on the special interests to realize the potential of wireless spectrum for our safety and connectivity  now is not the time for small plans  now is the time for bold action to rebuild and renew america  we've done this before  two hundred years ago  in   thomas jefferson oversaw an infrastructure plan that envisioned the homestead act  the transcontinental railroads  and the erie canal  one hundred years later  in   teddy roosevelt called together leaders from business and government to develop a plan for a  th century infrastructure  today  in   it falls on us to take up this call again   to re imagine america's landscape and remake america's future  that is the cause of this campaign  and that will be the cause of my presidency  but understand   while the change we seek will require major investments by a more accountable government  it will not come from government alone  washington can't solve all our problems  the statehouse can't solve all our problems  city hall can't solve all our problems  it goes back to what i learned as a community organizer all those years ago   that change in this country comes not from the top down  but from the bottom up  change starts at a level that's even closer to the people than our mayors   it starts in our homes  it starts in our families  it starts by raising our children right  by turning off the tv  and putting away the video games  by going to those parent teacher conferences and helping our children with their homework  and setting a good example  it starts by being good neighbors and good citizens who are willing to volunteer in our communities   to keep them clean  to keep them safe  and to serve as mentors and teachers to all of our children  that's where change begins  that's how we'll bring about change in our neighborhoods  and if change comes to our neighborhoods  then change will come to our cities  and if change comes to our cities  then change will come to our regions  and if change comes to our regions  then i truly believe change will come to every corner of this country we love  throughout our history  it's been our cities that have helped tell the american story  it was boston that rose up against an empire  and philadelphia where liberty first rung out  it was st  louis that opened a gateway west  and houston that launched us to the stars  it was the motor city that built the middle class  miami that built a bridge to the americas  and new york that showed the world one clear september morning that america stands together in times of trial  that's the proud tradition our cities uphold  that's the story our cities have helped write  and if you're willing to work with me and fight with me and stand with me this fall  then i promise you this   we will not only rebuild and renew our american cities  north and south  east and west  but you and i   together   will rebuild and renew the promise of america  thank you "], ["obama1", "it's great to be back in new mexico  and to have this opportunity to discuss some of the challenges that working women are facing  because i would not be standing before you today as a candidate for president of the united states if it weren't for working women  i am here because of my mother  a single mom who put herself through school  followed her passion for helping others  and raised my sister and me to believe that in america  there are no barriers to success if you're willing to work for it  i am here because of my grandmother  who helped raised me  she worked during world war ii on a bomber assembly line   she was rosie the riveter  then  even though she never got more than a high school diploma  she worked her way up from her start as a secretary at a bank  and ended up being the financial rock for our entire family when i was growing up  and i am here because of my wife michelle  the rock of the obama family  who worked her way up from modest roots on the south side of chicago  and who has juggled jobs and parenting with more skill and grace than anyone i know  now michelle and i want our two daughters to grow up in an america where they have the freedom and opportunity to live their dreams and raise their own families  but even as these stories speak to the progress that we've made  we know that too many of america's daughters grow up facing barriers to their dreams  and that has consequences for all american families  for decades we've had politicians in washington who talk about family values  but we haven't had policies that value families  instead  it's harder for working parents to make a living while raising their kids  and we know that the system is especially stacked against women  and that's why washington has to change  now senator mccain is an honorable man  and we respect his service  but when you look at our records and our plans on issues that matter to working women  the choice could not be clearer  it starts with equal pay    percent of working women in america earn half   or more than half   of their family's income  but women still earn only   cents for every dollar earned by men  in   you'd think that washington would be united in its determination to fight for equal pay  that's why i was proud to co sponsor the lilly ledbetter fair pay restoration act  which would have reversed last year's supreme court decision  which made it more difficult for women to challenge pay discrimination on the job  but senator mccain thinks the supreme court got it right  he opposed the fair pay restoration act  he suggested that the reason women don't have equal pay isn't discrimination on the job   it's because they need more education and training  that's just totally wrong  lilly ledbetter's problem was not that she was somehow unqualified or unprepared for higher paying positions  she most certainly was  and by all reports she was an excellent employee  her problem was that her employer paid her less than men who were doing the exact same work  john mccain just has it wrong  he said the fair pay restoration act  opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems  but i can't think of any problem more important than making sure that women get equal pay for equal work  it's a matter of equality  it's a matter of fairness  that's why i stood up for equal pay in the illinois state senate  and helped pass a law to give   more women protection from paycheck discrimination  that's why i've been fighting to pass legislation in the senate  so that employers don't get away with discriminating against hardworking women like lilly ledbetter  and that's why i'll continue to stand up for equal pay as president  senator mccain won't  and that's a real difference in this election  as the son of a single mother  i also don't accept an america that makes women choose between their kids and their careers  it's not acceptable that women are denied jobs or promotions because they've got kids at home  it's not acceptable that forty percent of working women don't have a single paid sick day  that's wrong for working parents  it's wrong for america's children  and it's not who we are as a country  i'll be a president who stands up for the american family by giving all working parents a hand  to help with childcare  i'll expand the child and dependent care tax credit  so that working families can receive up to a   percent credit for their child care expenses  i'll double funding for afterschool programs that help children learn and give parents relief  and i'll invest   billion to guarantee access to quality  affordable  early childhood education for every child in america  and with more and more households headed by two working parents   or a single working parent   it's also time to dramatically expand the family and medical leave act  since more americans are working for small businesses  i'll expand fmla to cover businesses with as few as   employees   this will reach millions of american workers who aren't covered today  we'll also allow workers to take leave to care for elderly parents  we'll allow parents to take   hours of annual leave to join school activities with their kids  and we'll cover employees who are victims of domestic violence or sexual assault  i'll also stand up for paid leave  today    percent of workers covered by fmla don't take leave because it isn't paid  that's just not fair  you shouldn't be punished for getting sick or dealing with a family crisis  that's why i'll require employers to provide all of their workers with seven paid sick days a year  and i'll support a  state strategy to adopt paid leave systems  and set aside   billion to fund it  i have a clear plan to expand paid leave and sick leave  senator mccain doesn't  and that's a real difference in this election  and at a time when folks are struggling with the rising price of everything from gas to groceries  i'll provide working women with immediate relief  while senator mccain wants to continue the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans who don't need them and didn't ask for them  i'll pass a middle class tax cut of   for each working family  this will deliver tax relief for over   million working women  and we need to help folks at the bottom of the ladder  almost   percent of americans who benefited from raising the minimum wage were women  i won't leave any working people behind  that's why  unlike senator mccain  i'll index the minimum wage to inflation so that it goes up each year to keep pace with rising costs  we can't afford an economy where folks keep working harder for less  we can't let the women in our workforce get paid even less for doing the same work  and we can't keep pushing more and more of the burden on to the backs of working parents who are struggling to balance their jobs and their family  because what binds us together  what makes us one american family  is that we stand up and fight for each other's dreams  and for the dreams of all of our children  i want my daughters to grow up in an america where they have opportunities that are even greater than their mother had  or their grandmothers  or their great grandmothers   an america where our daughters truly have the same opportunities as our sons  standing here today  i know that we have drawn closer to making this america a reality because of the extraordinary woman who i shared a stage with so many times throughout this campaign   senator hillary rodham clinton  and in the months and years ahead  i look forward to working with her to make progress on the issues that matter to american women and to all american families   health care and education  support for working parents and an insistence on equality  because i want sasha and malia to grow up in an america where both work and family are a part of the american dream  and where that dream is available to all  that's why i'm running for president of the united states "], ["obama1", "i want to start by thanking the folks here at springs preserve for the wonderful tour we just had  what we are seeing here   from the solar panels that power this facility to the bombard workers who built it   is that a green  renewable energy economy isn't some pie in the sky  far off future  it is now  it is creating jobs  now  it is providing cheap alternatives to  a barrel oil  now  and it can create millions of additional jobs and entire new industries if we act now  all across the country  local leaders and entrepreneurs and small business owners are providing the innovation and initiative needed to make this transformation possible  in pennsylvania  an old steel mill has become the home of a new wind turbine factory because of the state's push for renewable portfolio standards that require the production of more alternative energy  wisconsin is poised to gain more than   jobs at existing manufacturing facilities because of its investment in wind power  where we're standing in southern nevada happens to be one of the best sources for the generation of solar power in the world  next week  our friend and senate majority leader harry reid will come here to cut the ribbon on a new thermal solar technology plant  and between solar  wind  and geothermal energy  this state could create upwards of   new jobs by   the possibilities of renewable energy are limitless  but to truly harness its potential  we urgently need real leadership from washington   leadership that has been missing for decades  we have been talking about energy independence since americans were waiting in gas lines during the  s  we've heard promises about it in every state of the union for the last three decades  but each and every year  we become more  not less  addicted to oil   a  th century fossil fuel that is dirty  dwindling  and dangerously expensive  why  it isn't because the resources and technology aren't there  we know this because countries like spain  germany  and japan have already leapt ahead of us when it comes to renewable energy technology  germany  a country as cloudy as the pacific northwest  is now a world leader in the solar power industry and the quarter million new jobs it has created  in less than eight years  before we'd ever see a drop of oil from offshore drilling  they have doubled their renewable energy output  and they did it by using technology that  in some cases  was paid for by the american people through our own research and development tax credits  the difference is  their government harnessed that technology by providing the necessary investments and incentives to jumpstart a renewable energy industry  washington hasn't done that  what washington has done is what washington always does   it's peddled false promises  irresponsible policy  and cheap gimmicks that might get politicians through the next election  but won't lead america toward the next generation of renewable energy  and now we're paying the price  now we've fallen behind the rest of the world  now we're forced to beg saudi arabia for more oil  now we're facing gas prices over   a gallon   gas prices that are decimating the savings of families who are already struggling in this economy  like the man i met in pennsylvania who lost his job and couldn't even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one  that's how badly folks are hurting  that's how badly washington has failed  for decades  john mccain has been a part of this failure in washington  yes  he has gone further than some in his party in speaking out on climate change  and that is commendable  but time and time again  he has opposed investing in the alternative sources of energy that have helped fuel some of the very same projects and businesses he's highlighting in this campaign  he's voted against biofuels  against solar power  against wind power  against a   energy bill that represented the largest ever investment in renewable sources of energy   a bill that senator mccain's own campaign co chair  called  the biggest legislative breakthrough we've had  since he's been in the senate  that bill certainly wasn't perfect   it contained irresponsible tax breaks for oil companies that i consistently opposed  and that i will repeal as president  but the tax credits in that bill contributed to wind power growing   last year  the sharpest rise in decades  if john mccain had his way  those tax credits wouldn't exist  and if we don't renew key tax incentives for alternative energy production   tax incentives that john mccain opposed continuing   we could lose up to   green jobs and   billion in investment just next year  and now he's talking about a tax credit for more efficient cars even though he helped george bush block these credits twice in the last year  after all those years in washington  john mccain still doesn't get it  i commend him for his desire to accelerate the search for a battery that can power the cars of the future  i've been talking about this myself for the last few years  but i don't think a   million prize is enough  when john f  kennedy decided that we were going to put a man on the moon  he didn't put a bounty out for some rocket scientist to win   he put the full resources of the united states government behind the project and called on the ingenuity and innovation of the american people  that's the kind of effort we need to achieve energy independence in this country  and nothing less will do  but in this campaign  john mccain offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices  gimmicks that will only increase our oil addiction for another four years  senator mccain wants a gas tax holiday that will save you   at most   thirty cents a day for three months  and that's only if the oil companies don't just jack up the price and pocket the savings themselves  which is exactly what they did when we tried to do the same thing in illinois  he's willing to spend nearly   billion on more tax breaks for big oil companies   including   billion for exxon alone  he wants to open our coastlines to drilling   a proposal that his own top economic advisor admitted won't provide any short term relief at the pump  it's a proposal that george bush's administration says will not provide a drop of oil   not a single drop   for at least ten years  and by the time the drilling is fully underway in twenty years  our own department of energy says that the effect on gas prices will be  insignificant  insignificant  just yesterday  senator mccain actually admitted this  in a town hall he said  and i quote   i don't see an immediate relief  but  the fact that we are exploiting those reserves would have psychological impact that i think is beneficial  psychological impact  in case you were wondering  that's washington speak for   it polls well  it's an example of how washington politicians try to convince you that they did something to make your life better when they really didn't  well the american people don't need psychological relief or meaningless gimmicks to get politicians through the next election  they need real relief that will help them fill up their tanks and put food on their table  they need a long term energy strategy that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil by investing in the renewable sources of energy that represent the future  that's what they need  meanwhile  the oil companies already own drilling rights to   million acres of federal lands  onshore and offshore  that they haven't touched    million acres that have the potential to nearly double america's total oil production  and john mccain wants to give them more  well that might make sense in washington  but it doesn't make sense for america  in fact  it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build   new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than right here at yucca mountain  folks  these are not serious energy policies  they are not new energy policies  and they are certainly not the kind of energy policies that will give families the relief they need or our country the oil independence we must have  i realize that gimmicks like the gas tax holiday and offshore drilling might poll well these days  but i'm not running for president to do what polls well  i'm running to do what's right for america  i wish i could wave a magic wand and make gas prices go down  but i can't  what i can do   and what i will do   is push for a second stimulus package that will send out another round of rebate checks to the american people  what i will do as president is tax the record profits of oil companies and use the money to help struggling families pay their energy bills  i will provide a   tax cut that will go to   of all workers and their families in this country  and i will close the loophole that allows corporations like enron to engage in unregulated speculation that ends up artificially driving up the price of oil  that's how we'll provide real relief to the american people  that's the change we need  i have a very different vision of what this country can and should achieve on energy in the next four years   in the next ten years  i have a plan to raise the fuel standards in our cars and trucks with technology we have on the shelf today   technology that will make sure we get more miles to the gallon  and we will provide financial help to our automakers and autoworkers to help them make this transition  i will invest   billion over the next ten years in alternative sources of energy like wind power  and solar power  and advanced biofuels   investments that will create up to five million new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  that will create billions of dollars in new business like you're already doing here in nevada  and before we hand over more of our land and our coastline to oil companies  i will charge those companies a fee for every acre that they currently lease but don't drill on  if that compels them to drill  we'll get more oil  if it doesn't  the fees will go toward more investment in renewable sources of energy  when all is said and done  my plan to increase our fuel standards will save american consumers from purchasing half a trillion gallons of gas over the next eighteen years  my entire energy plan will produce three times the oil savings that john mccain's ever could   and what's more  it will actually decrease our dependence on oil while his will only grow our addiction further  and that's the choice that you face in this election  when you're facing   a gallon gas  do you want a gas tax gimmick that will save you at most thirty cents a day for three months and a drilling proposal that won't provide a drop of oil for ten years  or a second rebate check and   tax cut to help your family pay the bills  when you look down the road five years from now or ten years from now  do you want to see an america that's begging dictators for more oil that we can't afford  an america that's fallen further behind the rest of the world when it comes to the jobs and industries of the future  or do you want to see more places like springs preserve and bombard electric  more green jobs and green businesses  more innovation and ingenuity that helps this nation lead the way on affordable  renewable energy  that's the future i know we can have  that's the america i believe in  and that's where i will lead us if i have the chance to serve as your president  it will not be easy  it will not happen overnight  it will not come without cost or sacrifice  but it is possible  it is necessary  and places like this  and people like you  prove that we have the resources  and the skills  and the will to begin today  i look forward to joining you in that effort  thank you "], ["obama1", "in a few minutes  we'll open this up to a discussion about the changes that america must make to compete in the global economy  i'm honored to be joined by leaders from government and the grassroots  from business and labor  from academia and the non profit sector  because for america to succeed  we'll have to join together to harness the energy and ingenuity of the american people  this morning  i'd like to talk about how we're going to do just that  for the last three weeks  i've been traveling around the country  talking about how we can change our economy so that it works for the american people  i've also been listening  i met with parents in wisconsin who struggle to afford the groceries to let their family eat well  or the gas that takes them to and from work  i talked to a man in missouri whose wife works two jobs and has arthritis that costs   a week to care for  i heard from a student in minnesota who has done everything that's been asked of her  but worries that she won't be able to take her final tests because she's maxed out her student loans  stories like these can be found all across the country  because far too many americans are working hard and doing their part  but still can't keep pace  it's time for us to recognize that these individual stories connect to a larger american story  all of us have a stake in our common prosperity  when folks are struggling out on main street  that pain is going to trickle up to wall street  and just as we must provide relief to americans who are struggling  we also have to recognize that we're failing to put ourselves in a position to compete in the global economy  our country faces new challenges to our leadership in this young century  our kids will grow up facing competition from their counterparts in beijing and bangalore  if we don't change course  there's no guarantee that the american dream will be there for my daughters   or your sons   as it was there for us  america risks falling behind  if we remain dependent on oil from dictators  we'll endanger our security  imperil our planet  pay more at the pump  and sit on the sidelines while the jobs of the future are created abroad  if we can't give every child in america the chance to get a world class education  we'll cripple their ability to make a living in a knowledge based economy  and watch china and india move ahead in the race for the  st century  if we can't control skyrocketing health care costs  we'll confront a mounting moral crisis  and a major anchor on the ability of american business to compete  if we don't rebuild our crumbling roads  rail bridges and electrical grid  we'll see our standard of living suffer  while we leave our communities less safe from terror or natural disaster  and if we don't invest in and encourage innovation  we could cede america's historic role as the engine of growth  and progress  and discovery for the entire world  these challenges are real  how we deal with them will shape the prosperity of every single american  and the future of america's leadership in the  st century  now  it falls to us to look at these problems  and to see the possibility embedded within them  it falls to us to do what generations of americans have done before  and to remake the world as it should be  my opponent in this campaign has served this country with honor  and i look forward to debating him on these issues  because we have a very different view of the choices that america needs to make  he has supported and would continue   an agenda that has failed to keep pace with the challenges of the  st century  i believe we must move in a new direction  if we have the courage to commit to change  the american people can not just seize   but shape   the opportunities of the global economy  together  we can author our own story  together  we can pursue a  st century leadership agenda that's focused on five areas  energy  education  health care  infrastructure  and innovation  success will not come from washington   it must come from the dynamism  determination and ingenuity of the american people  through new partnerships between states and cities  the public and private sector  and through the active involvement of the american people  but we also know that for our country to succeed  washington has to change  because at moments of great economic transformation  government must serve as a catalyst for change   to leverage all of the sectors of american society that are represented here today  this can be the moment when we make a truly national effort to end our addiction to oil  just as roosevelt invested in an arsenal of democracy and kennedy took us to the moon  we can be the generation that achieves energy security  grows our economy  and saves our planet  american presidents have been calling for this kind of effort since nixon  but now is the time to act  we could have made that choice in   but instead we got secret task forces and greater energy dependence  and we've watched as countries like brazil and germany have created hundreds of thousands of jobs  we have failed to act  and we've fallen behind  i've proposed investing   billion in a green energy sector to create five million new jobs   good jobs that can't be outsourced  but this must merely be a spark for american industry and innovators to develop alternatives to oil and gas  and to create a new energy economy  if we do this  the great assembly line manufacturers of the  th century can turn out cars that run on renewable energy  the dictators who hold our security hostage will see their leverage disappear along with their revenue  the oceans will no longer rise  and our planet will be preserved  that's what we must do as a centerpiece of our competitiveness strategy as a nation  this can be the moment when we make an historic commitment to education  because we cannot be satisfied until every child in america   and i mean every child   has the same chance to get a world class education that we want for our own children  we need to commit   billion to give every child access to quality  early childhood education  but we also need a  state strategy that reaches down to the grassroots  to have successful schools  we need to recruit an army of new teachers  and provide them with better pay and more support   but we also have to develop new curricula and renewed accountability  to lift up our children  we need a national commitment   but we also need parents to get up off the couch  turn off the tv  and to read to their children  and to educate the best workforce in the world  a college education should be the birthright of every american   but we also have to ask our young people to invest in america through service  and we should work with our community colleges to provide new skills and lifelong learning  that's what we must do to extend the american dream  this can be the moment when we finally come together to make health care affordable and accessible for every single american  and lower costs for all american families  here in pittsburgh  we've seen the advances that can be made when we see the opportunities embedded in providing health care  we can create a future where medical records are electronic  enhancing care and lowering costs  we can invest in new cures and put a new emphasis on prevention  so that we have a healthier and more productive population  we can forge new alliances between business and labor to ensure that workers are covered  and that corporations are no longer saddled with rising costs  that's how we're going to care for our people and help american businesses compete  this can be the moment when we make a generational commitment to rebuild our infrastructure  that's what teddy roosevelt did when he brought together leaders from the public and private sector to plan for  th century infrastructure  that's what we must do here in the  st  washington can seed this effort  that's why i've proposed putting   billion into a national infrastructure reinvestment bank to rebuild our roads and bridges  our rail and ports  this must leverage the kind of private investment that can create millions of jobs and remake our communities  years from now  we could drive on new roads  depend on safe bridges and stronger levees  and connect our cities with high speed rail  we can begin the investment in a smart electrical grid to power electric cars and transmit clean energy across the country  and we can achieve the simple goal of making sure that every american has access to the high speed broadband   no matter how much money you have  or where you come from  you should have access to this technology  that's what we must do to make sure that america runs on a strong  fair and efficient foundation  and this can be the moment when we invest in the science and innovation that will shape our future  because in a technology driven economy  america must always stay on the cutting edge  that means reversing a trend where we devote a smaller and smaller share of our national resources to research and development  an innovation agenda must commit to funding basic research and making the r amp d  tax credit permanent  it must also exempt start ups from capital gains taxes  and remove bureaucratic barriers to entrepreneurs   for instance  by making our patent process more efficient and reliable  we need the discoveries of tomorrow to be made in our labs and universities   at pitt and carnegie mellon  we need the success stories of tomorrow   the next google  or the next microsoft   to take place here in america  this agenda is ambitious  it will take resources in the wake of policies that have run up our debt  but the answer to our fiscal problems is not to short change investments in our ability to compete   investments that are vital to long term growth  to stop mortgaging our children's future  we need to eliminate waste in existing programs  end the iraq war  generate revenue by charging polluters for their emissions  and put an end to corporate loopholes and tax cuts for the wealthy  we can have a smarter government that pays its way while investing in our country's future  that is how washington must change to become a catalyst for growth  because in cities and towns across america  i know that the american people are ready to rise to the challenge of a new moment   they just haven't been asked  it's time for that to change  because there is nothing that americans can't do when we choose to rise together  for two hundred and fifty years  that is what has been done here in pittsburgh  this is where u s  steel became the first billion dollar corporation  and turned out more steel at the dawn of the cold war than the entire soviet union  and just as that output built our cities and laid down the rails that connected them  the work that created that wealth was the foundation of a middle class where each generation's opportunities could extend a little further  and each individual's story could advance the larger american story  many of the steel mills are gone  but this american city has found new opportunity through health care and it  through finance and universities  now  we must connect that local innovation and ingenuity to a national strategy  the american story is never static  but as we move from one chapter to the next  we must always remember that our national greatness is advanced when we act on our fundamental goodness  america succeeds when the playing field is level and open  and people don't fall behind  when government is not an obstacle  but a catalyst for shared prosperity  when we come together to find new ways to expand the horizon of opportunity for each and every american  and with your help  that is the kind of america i want to build as president of the united states "], ["obama1", " b clinton b  hello  unity  hello  new hampshire  well  unity is not only a beautiful place  as we can see  it's a wonderful feeling  isn't it  and i know what we start here in this field in unity will end on the steps of the capitol when barack obama takes the oath of office as our next president  it is wonderful to be here with all of you  i want to thank ken hall for welcoming us  and encourage everybody to support the party  i want to recognize and thank the two members of congress from here in new hampshire  paul hodes and carol shea porter  and of course  your great governor  governor lynch  and his wonderful wife  dr  susan lynch  i expect that each of those wonderful public officials will be let elected overwhelmingly come november  thanks to the hard work by democratic party chair ray buckley and all of the team that's working with him  and i hope that you will send your former governor  jeanne shaheen  to represent you in the united states senate  senator obama  when he becomes president  is going to need more democratic senators  and jeanne shaheen will lead the charge  i want to thank chip baldwin  the principal of unity elementary school  your pre program band  the pop gun seven  and all of the people who have come here to unity to be with barack and me  and it is a great pleasure and honor  as i have said many times  new hampshire has a special place in my heart  and i'm here today to ensure that  come november  new hampshire will have a special place in barack obama's heart  as well  a year and a half ago  barack and i each began a journey to make history and to remake america  journeys that took us from one end of this great diverse country of ours to the other  to big cities and small towns  to homes and schools  to businesses  churches  and union halls  and into the lives of millions and millions of americans who love this country  refuse to give up on our promise  and are determined and ready for change  now i don't think it's at all unknown among this audience that this was a hard fought primary campaign  we have traversed america  making our case to the american people  we have gone toe to toe in this hard fought primary  but today and every day going forward  we stand shoulder to shoulder for the ideals we share  the values we cherish  and the country we love  we may have started on separate paths  but today our paths have merged  today our hearts are set on the same destination for america  today we are coming together for the same goal  to elect barack obama as the next president of the united states  i was honored to be in this race with barack  and i am proud that we had a spirited dialogue  that was the nicest way i could think of phrasing it  but it was spirited because we both care so much  and so do our supporters  each and every one of you  and i am so proud and privileged today  here in unity  to help bring together the   million americans who supported us to create an unstoppable force for change we can all believe in  now  senator mccain and the republicans may have hoped that we wouldn't join forces like this  they may have wished that we wouldn't stand united to fight this battle with everything we've got  but i've got news for them  we are one party  we are one america  and we are not going to rest until we take back our country and put it once again on the path to peace  prosperity  and progress in the  st century   i unidentified male i  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can i unidentified female i  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can i unidentified male i  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can b clinton b  now  i know senator obama  i've served with him in the senate for four years  i campaigned with and against him for lots of months  i have stood or sat on a stage in   i lost count  but i think   debates  so i've had a front row seat to his candidacy  and i've seen his strength and determination  his grace  and his grit  and in his own life  barack obama has lived the american dream  as a community organizer  as a state senator  and now as a united states senator  he has dedicated himself to ensuring that the dream is within reach of all of our people  that's why both of us were in this race  because we believe in the old fashioned idea that public service is about helping people  helping them solve their problems and live out their own dreams  because we've had every opportunity and blessing in our own lives and we want the same for every american  that we do not want to see our country continue on a path where people feel that their government doesn't work and their president doesn't care  we want  once again  to make sure    applause b clinton b   that every american is seen  there are no invisible americans  that the trials and troubles that fall to each of us during a lifetime are ones that are recognized and shared  and that a helping hand is there when it's needed  this has been my life's work and it was the purpose of my campaign  and the way to continue that fight  to accomplish the goals that we all care about and stand for  is to take our passion  our energy  and our strength and do everything we can to elect barack obama the next president of the united states   cheering  amp  applause b crowd b  obama  obama  obama  obama b clinton b  you know    b crowd b  hillary  hillary  hillary  hillary b clinton b  i have   i've been involved in politics and public life in one way or another for four decades  now  this is the moment when someone is supposed to yell  i don't believe it   b obama b  i don't believe it   b clinton b  yes  i don't believe it  thank you  barack   cheering b obama b  can't be more than    b clinton b  and during those years  our country has voted   times to elect a president  and democrats won only three of those times   booing b clinton b  it's true  isn't it hard to believe  and think of the progress that we have not made  think of the problems that have only gotten worse  i'm very proud that two of those three times was somebody i know quite well and  applause b clinton b  you know  during the  s under a democratic president  we had a flourishing economy  a nation at peace  america's leadership respected around the world  a democratic president is absolutely essential for america once again to fulfill the purpose of america  to move toward that more perfect union  to make that progress that ensures every generation to come will have the same opportunities and blessings that we have taken for granted  when we think about the lost opportunities and the damage that has been done during the past     years  on the environment and the economy  on healthcare and civil rights  on education  foreign policy  and the supreme court  imagine how far we could have come had we had a democrat in the white house  so  that little history aside is really to make a very serious point  we cannot let this moment slip away  we must affirm our commitment to making sure that we have a democratic president come next january  and in this town  where when the polls closed and the ballots were counted  barack got   votes and i got   votes   cheering  amp  applause b clinton b  but both barack and i know that those votes were not just for us  each vote cast was a prayer for our nation  a declaration of your dreams for your children  a reflection of your desire to chart a new course for our nation  each of those votes was truly a vote of confidence in the american dream  a vote for an economy where your hard work is rewarded  an economy that lifts all of our families and ensures that prosperity is shared  each vote was an affirmation of a fundamental moral principle that in the richest nation on earth  no father should have to choose between healthcare for himself and his children and no mother should be stuck in a dead end job just to keep her family's insurance   applause b clinton b  each vote was a commitment to an america defined by deep and meaningful equality  an america where we reach beyond the boundaries of color and creed  gender and geography  and embrace all of our people  each vote was a reflection of your belief that america can once again lead the world by our values  values that have shaped the aspirations of tens of millions across the globe  across generations  and has always been the source of our deepest strength  these are the goals we share  these are the ideals we believe in  these are the hopes for our future  and this is the work that we look forward to  the truth is  that in this election  we face an opponent with a very different vision of america  now  barack and i both have a great deal of respect for senator mccain and his heroic service to our nation   applause b clinton b  but in the end  after eight devastating years under president bush  senator mccain is simply offering four years more  he sees right wing judges appointed to the supreme court and says why not a few more  he sees billions of dollars in corporate tax cuts exploding our deficit and says why not billions more  he sees five long years in iraq and he's willing to stay for years  even decades more   booing b clinton b  in the end  senator mccain and president bush are like two sides of the same coin and it doesn't amount to a whole lot of change   cheering b clinton b  so  here's the choice in this election  if you like the direction america's going  then vote for senator mccain because you'll definitely get more of the same  but if you think we need a new course  a new agenda  then vote for barack obama and you will get the change that you and we need and deserve   cheering b clinton b  and to anyone who voted for me and is now considering not voting or voting for senator mccain  i strongly urge you to reconsider  i urge you to remember who we are standing for in this election  we are standing for the single mother with a young daughter juggling school and work who told me i'm doing it all to better myself for her  we're standing for the woman who grabbed my hand and asked me  what are you going to make sure you do so i have healthcare and began to cry because even though she works three jobs  she can't afford insurance  we're standing for the young man in the marine corps t shirt who waited months for medical care and said take care of my buddies  a lot of them are still over there  and then  will you please take care of me  we're standing for all of those who lost jobs and healthcare who can't afford gas or groceries  who felt invisible to this president  and that's why i'm standing with senator obama today because i know he'll work for you  he'll fight for you  and he'll stand up for you every single day in the white house   cheering  amp  applause b clinton b  because i know he'll be a leader who invests in our people and helps us seize the promise of new leadership and restored reputation around the world  because i know he'll be a commander in chief who will never hesitate to use force when necessary  but never shrink from using diplomacy whenever possible   cheering b clinton b  i hope you'll join me  i hope you'll stand with me  i hope you'll work as hard for senator obama as many of you did for me  you know  a little while back  a woman handed me a photograph of her father as a young soldier  this very young man in his uniform was standing at attention as president truman presented him the medal of honor  the highest award that is given for military service  during world war ii  he had risked his life on a daring mission to drive back the enemy and protect his fellow soldiers  in the corner of that photo in shaky handwriting  this brave veteran had written simply   to hillary clinton  keep fighting for us  so to that american hero  and to all of you  i want you to know that's exactly what i'm going to do  that is why i'm standing here with senator obama  that is why i will be working hard for his election  that is why i will be fighting to change the direction of this country and once again give it back to the people   cheering  amp  applause b clinton b  it has been the honor and privilege of my life to compete for the presidency of the united states  to meet the people who have invested so much of your time  your money  your heart  your soul into this election  and to know what a great and good country this is  and i believe with all my heart that this election is one of the most important in our nation's history  we've had significant challenges in every generation  and we usually  finally summon up the will to address them  so  i think winston churchill once said   the americans always get around to doing the right thing after trying nearly everything else  the country is ready  now we need the leadership to make it happen  a leader who is a partner to bring about the change and progress that is so yearned for  so  think hard about how we will fulfill the promise of this great nation  how we will uphold the ideals we cherish and reclaim the country we love  and the answer for me here in unity  new hampshire  is to pledge my support and my hard work and my effort to the next president of the united states  barack obama   cheering b crowd b  thank you  hillary  thank you  hillary   b obama b  thank you  hillary  thank you  hillary  so you guys   you guys peeked at my speech  you already know the first line  i   let me begin because i've got a lot to say about this great leader standing next to me  but i don't want to be remiss by failing to thank all the other people who are here today  i want to thank chip baldwin  the principal of unity elementary  i want to thank ken for the wonderful introduction as well as the cutting boards that he gave us  i want to thank my great friends  paul hodes and carol shea  porter  i want to thank the next great senator from new hampshire  jeanne shaheen  i want to thank your wonderful governor  john lynch and his wonderful wife  dr  susan lynch  the pop gun seven  and i want to thank the kiwanis club which is selling  i think some burgers and hot dogs and some other stuff for the children here in unity  and so  if everybody's getting hungry  just head on over  i think the truck's right behind this big  change you can believe in  sign  thank you  hillary clinton  thank you  thank you  unity  and thank you  new hampshire for hosting our little get together here today   cheering b obama b  i want to start by saying a few words about the woman you just heard from  you know  for   months  senator clinton and i have shared the stage as rivals for the nomination  but today  i could not be happier and more honored and more moved that we're sharing the stage as allies to bring about the fundamental changes that this country so desperately needs   applause b obama b  as somebody who   as somebody who took the same historic journey as senator clinton  who watched her campaign and debate  i know firsthand how good she is  how tough she is  how passionate she is  how committed she is to the causes that brought all of us here today   cheering b obama b  when hillary clinton gets up in the morning  even in the face of the toughest odds  the most vicious attacks  she is doing so with the same motivation that took her and bill clinton to sign up for their first campaign in texas all those years ago  the same passion that led her to work for the children's defense fund and caused her to fight for healthcare as first lady  what has made her one of the finest senators that new york has ever seen  what has made her a historic candidate for president  an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary americans no matter how difficult that fight may be   cheering  amp  applause b obama b  i've admired here as a leader  i've learned from her as a candidate  she rocks  she rocks  that's the point i'm trying to make   laughter b obama b  i am proud to call her a friend and i know how much we need both bill and hillary clinton as a party and as a country in the months and years to come  they have done so much great work  i don't think it's been   years  i   you know  maybe for the last couple  you know  but it's amazing how much they got done in five year's time  but we need them  we need them badly  not just my campaign  but the american people need their service and their vision and their wisdom in the months and years to come because that's how we're going to bring about unity in the democratic party and that's how we're going to bring about unity in america  and that's how we're going to deliver the american dream in every corner of every state of this great nation that we love   cheering b obama b  hillary and i may have started with separate goals in this campaign  but we've made history together  together  we inspire tens of millions of people to participate  some to cast ballots for the very first time  others who voted for the first time in a very long time  and together in this campaign in   we shattered barriers that have stood firm since the founding of this nation  barriers that our supporters  perhaps  at the beginning didn't believe could be shattered  i don't pretend that one election can erase all the past biases and outdated attitudes that we're still wrestling to overcome  i know that there have been times over the last   months when those biases have emerged  and senator clinton has always brushed them off  dealt with them with her usual grace and aplomb  but i also know that while this campaign has shown us how far we have to go  it's also proven the progress we have made  i know that because of our campaign  because of the campaign that hillary clinton waged  my daughters and all of your daughters will forever know that there is no barrier to who they are and what they can be in the united states of america   cheering b obama b  they can take for granted that women can do anything that the boys can do   cheering b obama b  and do it better and do it in heels   cheering b obama b  i still don't know how she does it in heels   laughter b obama b  i don't know  it's fitting that we meet in a place called unity because the truth is that's the only way we can solve the challenges facing this country  today  we look back at the votes that took place here in the snows in january    votes for senator clinton    votes for me  but now  we look at them as   votes for change here in america   cheering b obama b  votes cast by young and old  by men and women  by rich and poor  by democrats and independents  and even some republicans who have said enough is enough  it is time to bring about change here in america   cheering b obama b  and that's why in this moment  we have to come together not just as democrats  but also as americans  united by our understanding that there's no problem we can't solve  no challenge we cannot meet  as one nation  as one people  now  the decisions we make in this election and the next few years on iraq and climate change  on our economy and making sure that it's working for everybody and not just some  those choices will shape the next generation and possibly the next century  and on each and every issue   on each and every issue in this campaign  the choice could not be clearer  it is a choice between moving forward and falling farther behind  it's a choice between more of the same policies that have failed us for eight long years or a new direction for the country we love  we can continue spending   billion to   billion a month in iraq and leave our troops there for the next   or   or   years  we can follow a policy that doesn't change whether violence is up or violence is down  whether it be iraqi government takes responsibility or not  or we can decide that it's time to be in a responsible  gradual  withdrawal from iraq  it is time to rebuild our military  it is time to treat our veterans with the dignity and respect they deserve  it's time to refocus our attention on the war we have to win in afghanistan  it is time to go after the al qaeda leadership where it actually exists  it is time to bring this war in iraq to a close  and that's what we will be working with  and working on when i am president of the united states  that's the choice in this election   cheering  amp  applause b obama b  we can continue to watch the cost of healthcare spiral out of control  push more families and businesses into bankruptcy and allow the number of uninsured to rise  or we can decide that it's time to guarantee coverage to every american who wants it  it's time to bring down the typical family premium by   it's time to bring down the costs for the entire country by bringing our healthcare system into the  st century through better technology and more emphasis on prevention and nobody knows this better than hillary clinton  and that's the choice you have in this election  you can go with john mccain's plans to do nothing or you can stand side by side with me and hillary clinton and finally once and for all provide the healthcare that every american needs in this nation   cheering b obama b  we can continue to depend on dictators for our energy and destroy our planet in the process  we can give billions of dollars in tax breaks to oil companies who are making record profits while we offer pennies to consumers on a   gallon of gas  or we can decide that solving our energy crisis will be one of the great projects of this generation  we can decide that it's time to give americans immediate relief with another round of tax rebate checks and eliminate the oil company give aways and invest in clean  renewable energies like wind and solar and biofuela  investments that can create millions of jobs and clean up the planet and free ourselves from dependence on other nations  it's time to leave our children a planet that is greener and cleaner  that's what hillary clinton believes in  that's what i believe in  and that's the choice we have in this election   cheering b crowd b  yes we can  yes we can  yes we can  yes we can b obama b  we can watch   we can watch another generation of children languish in schools that don't work  graduate without the skills they need to compete in this new global economy  or we can make a commitment to every child  not just slogans  but a real commitment  everywhere  from the day they're born to the day they graduate from college  that we will invest in early childhood education to close the achievement gap  that we will recruit an army of new teachers and give them more pay and give them more support and make sure that we're giving scholarships to every young person in america who wants to go to college and exchange for community service  that's the choice that we have in this election   cheering b obama b  when it comes to our struggling economy  we can allow the divide between main street and wall street to grow  or we can ensure that our prosperity is once again a tide that's lifting all boats  we can have a tax code that rewards wealth and hands out billions of dollars more to big corporations and multi millionaires or we can provide   tax cut to   percent of families in america  start rewarding work and not just wealth and eliminate income taxes for seniors making   a year or less  that's an agenda for change that we can believe in  that's the choice that we can make in this election   cheering  amp  applause b obama b  we can keep giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  or we can give tax breaks to companies that invest right here in new hampshire   cheering b obama b  we can allow millions of americans to work full time  but still not make enough to support their families  or we can raise the minimum wage index that's in inflation  and ensure that in america  hard work pays off   cheering b obama b  we can perpetuate a system in which women are paid less for the same work as men  or you can join senator hillary clinton and barack obama to start doing something to reverse some of these policies and make sure that equal pay for equal work is a reality all across america  that's a choice in this election   cheering b obama b  no matter where we disagree  these are the issues that have always united senator clinton and myself  they are the causes that unite both of us as democrats  and i believe at this moment  they are the causes that can unite us as americans  because the choice in this election is not between left or right  it's not between liberal or conservative  it's between the past and the future  and it's time for us to move towards that future together  i know it won't be easy  senator clinton knows it won't be easy  i know it won't be easy  it's not going to happen overnight  and i know that there are going to be times when we as americans disagree  but i also know that i've seen people of differing views and opinions come together and find common cause throughout the two decades in my public life  i've brought some of those people together myself  i've walked arm in arm as a community leader in chicago on the south side watching the tensions between black and white and hispanic ease as people began to recognize that the only way to fix up broken neighborhoods is to start working together  through two decades of service  i've worked with friends in the other party to provide more children with health insurance and more working families with tax breaks  to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and ensure that the american people know where their tax dollars are being spent  to reduce the influence of lobbyists in washington who all too often set the agenda  in our country  i found this cooperation does not happen because we agree on everything  but as senator clinton and i were talking about as we flew up to new hampshire today  behind all the labels  behind all the false divisions and all the false categories that define us  beyond all the petty bickering and beyond all the point  scoring in washington  and that you see sometimes dominating the cable news  americans are a fundamentally decent and generous and hardworking people  with an awful lot of common sense   applause b obama b  that's been the great privilege of this campaign  you know  sometimes spending time in washington  you get a little discouraged  but when you start traveling around the country  when you look at a scene like this  and you look out at the faces of america  you can't help but feel optimistic  because there are a set of common hopes and common values and common dreams that each of us share  i don't care  black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  young  old  rich  poor  it doesn't matter  there's a sense of what this country is fundamentally about   a fundamental goodness  and that if we tap into that  i am absolutely convinced that we can lift this country up to new and greater heights  this is one of those amendments moments in our history when we have to tap the decency of the american people  this is our chance to turn the page on the policies of the last seven and a half years  this is our chance to bring a new energy policy to america and new ideas to america  this is our chance  this is our time to march ford in unity as one people to the future  and i promise you that if you are willing to join me and you are willing to join hillary clinton  if all of you over the next four and a half months are willing not just to come to a rally but knock on some doors and make some phone calls and talk to your friends  if you are willing to organize and mobilize  then we are not just going to change this country  but we will change the world  thank you  senator hillary clinton  thank you  new hampshire  thank you  unity  let's get to work  thank you   applause "], ["obama1", "on a spring morning in april of   a simple band of colonists   farmers and merchants  blacksmiths and printers  men and boys   left their homes and families in lexington and concord to take up arms against the tyranny of an empire  the odds against them were long and the risks enormous   for even if they survived the battle  any ultimate failure would bring charges of treason  and death by hanging  and yet they took that chance  they did so not on behalf of a particular tribe or lineage  but on behalf of a larger idea  the idea of liberty  the idea of god given  inalienable rights  and with the first shot of that fateful day   a shot heard round the world   the american revolution  and america's experiment with democracy  began  those men of lexington and concord were among our first patriots  and at the beginning of a week when we celebrate the birth of our nation  i think it is fitting to pause for a moment and reflect on the meaning of patriotism   theirs  and ours  we do so in part because we are in the midst of war   more than one and a half million of our finest young men and women have now fought in iraq and afghanistan  over   have been wounded  and over   have been laid to rest  the costs of war have been great  and the debate surrounding our mission in iraq has been fierce  it is natural  in light of such sacrifice by so many  to think more deeply about the commitments that bind us to our nation  and to each other  we reflect on these questions as well because we are in the midst of a presidential election  perhaps the most consequential in generations  a contest that will determine the course of this nation for years  perhaps decades  to come  not only is it a debate about big issues   health care  jobs  energy  education  and retirement security   but it is also a debate about values  how do we keep ourselves safe and secure while preserving our liberties  how do we restore trust in a government that seems increasingly removed from its people and dominated by special interests  how do we ensure that in an increasingly global economy  the winners maintain allegiance to the less fortunate  and how do we resolve our differences at a time of increasing diversity  finally  it is worth considering the meaning of patriotism because the question of who is   or is not   a patriot all too often poisons our political debates  in ways that divide us rather than bringing us together  i have come to know this from my own experience on the campaign trail  throughout my life  i have always taken my deep and abiding love for this country as a given  it was how i was raised  it is what propelled me into public service  it is why i am running for president  and yet  at certain times over the last sixteen months  i have found  for the first time  my patriotism challenged   at times as a result of my own carelessness  more often as a result of the desire by some to score political points and raise fears about who i am and what i stand for  so let me say at this at outset of my remarks  i will never question the patriotism of others in this campaign  and i will not stand idly by when i hear others question mine  my concerns here aren't simply personal  however  after all  throughout our history  men and women of far greater stature and significance than me have had their patriotism questioned in the midst of momentous debates  thomas jefferson was accused by the federalists of selling out to the french  the anti federalists were just as convinced that john adams was in cahoots with the british and intent on restoring monarchal rule  likewise  even our wisest presidents have sought to justify questionable policies on the basis of patriotism  adams' alien and sedition act  lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus  roosevelt's internment of japanese americans   all were defended as expressions of patriotism  and those who disagreed with their policies were sometimes labeled as unpatriotic  in other words  the use of patriotism as a political sword or a political shield is as old as the republic  still  what is striking about today's patriotism debate is the degree to which it remains rooted in the culture wars of the  s   in arguments that go back forty years or more  in the early years of the civil rights movement and opposition to the vietnam war  defenders of the status quo often accused anybody who questioned the wisdom of government policies of being unpatriotic  meanwhile  some of those in the so called counter culture of the sixties reacted not merely by criticizing particular government policies  but by attacking the symbols  and in extreme cases  the very idea  of america itself   by burning flags  by blaming america for all that was wrong with the world  and perhaps most tragically  by failing to honor those veterans coming home from vietnam  something that remains a national shame to this day  most americans never bought into these simplistic world views   these caricatures of left and right  most americans understood that dissent does not make one unpatriotic  and that there is nothing smart or sophisticated about a cynical disregard for america's traditions and institutions  and yet the anger and turmoil of that period never entirely drained away  all too often our politics still seems trapped in these old  threadbare arguments   a fact most evident during our recent debates about the war in iraq  when those who opposed administration policy were tagged by some as unpatriotic  and a general providing his best counsel on how to move forward in iraq was accused of betrayal  given the enormous challenges that lie before us  we can no longer afford these sorts of divisions  none of us expect that arguments about patriotism will  or should  vanish entirely  after all  when we argue about patriotism  we are arguing about who we are as a country  and more importantly  who we should be  but surely we can agree that no party or political philosophy has a monopoly on patriotism  and surely we can arrive at a definition of patriotism that  however rough and imperfect  captures the best of america's common spirit  what would such a definition look like  for me  as for most americans  patriotism starts as a gut instinct  a loyalty and love for country rooted in my earliest memories  i'm not just talking about the recitations of the pledge of allegiance or the thanksgiving pageants at school or the fireworks on the fourth of july  as wonderful as those things may be  rather  i'm referring to the way the american ideal wove its way throughout the lessons my family taught me as a child  one of my earliest memories is of sitting on my grandfather's shoulders and watching the astronauts come to shore in hawaii  i remember the cheers and small flags that people waved  and my grandfather explaining how we americans could do anything we set our minds to do  that's my idea of america  i remember listening to my grandmother telling stories about her work on a bomber assembly line during world war ii  i remember my grandfather handing me his dog tags from his time in patton's army  and understanding that his defense of this country marked one of his greatest sources of pride  that's my idea of america  i remember  when living for four years in indonesia as a child  listening to my mother reading me the first lines of the declaration of independence    we hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights  that among these are life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness  i remember her explaining how this declaration applied to every american  black and white and brown alike  how those words  and words of the united states constitution  protected us from the injustices that we witnessed other people suffering during those years abroad  that's my idea of america  as i got older  that gut instinct   that america is the greatest country on earth   would survive my growing awareness of our nation's imperfections  it's ongoing racial strife  the perversion of our political system laid bare during the watergate hearings  the wrenching poverty of the mississippi delta and the hills of appalachia  not only because  in my mind  the joys of american life and culture  its vitality  its variety and its freedom  always outweighed its imperfections  but because i learned that what makes america great has never been its perfection but the belief that it can be made better  i came to understand that our revolution was waged for the sake of that belief   that we could be governed by laws  not men  that we could be equal in the eyes of those laws  that we could be free to say what we want and assemble with whomever we want and worship as we please  that we could have the right to pursue our individual dreams but the obligation to help our fellow citizens pursue theirs  for a young man of mixed race  without firm anchor in any particular community  without even a father's steadying hand  it is this essential american idea   that we are not constrained by the accident of birth but can make of our lives what we will   that has defined my life  just as it has defined the life of so many other americans  that is why  for me  patriotism is always more than just loyalty to a place on a map or a certain kind of people  instead  it is also loyalty to america's ideals   ideals for which anyone can sacrifice  or defend  or give their last full measure of devotion  i believe it is this loyalty that allows a country teeming with different races and ethnicities  religions and customs  to come together as one  it is the application of these ideals that separate us from zimbabwe  where the opposition party and their supporters have been silently hunted  tortured or killed  or burma  where tens of thousands continue to struggle for basic food and shelter in the wake of a monstrous storm because a military junta fears opening up the country to outsiders  or iraq  where despite the heroic efforts of our military  and the courage of many ordinary iraqis  even limited cooperation between various factions remains far too elusive  i believe those who attack america's flaws without acknowledging the singular greatness of our ideals  and their proven capacity to inspire a better world  do not truly understand america  of course  precisely because america isn't perfect  precisely because our ideals constantly demand more from us  patriotism can never be defined as loyalty to any particular leader or government or policy  as mark twain  that greatest of american satirists and proud son of missouri  once wrote   patriotism is supporting your country all the time  and your government when it deserves it  we may hope that our leaders and our government stand up for our ideals  and there are many times in our history when that's occurred  but when our laws  our leaders or our government are out of alignment with our ideals  then the dissent of ordinary americans may prove to be one of the truest expression of patriotism  the young preacher from georgia  martin luther king  jr  who led a movement to help america confront our tragic history of racial injustice and live up to the meaning of our creed   he was a patriot  the young soldier who first spoke about the prisoner abuse at abu ghraib   he is a patriot  recognizing a wrong being committed in this country's name  insisting that we deliver on the promise of our constitution   these are the acts of patriots  men and women who are defending that which is best in america  and we should never forget that   especially when we disagree with them  especially when they make us uncomfortable with their words  beyond a loyalty to america's ideals  beyond a willingness to dissent on behalf of those ideals  i also believe that patriotism must  if it is to mean anything  involve the willingness to sacrifice   to give up something we value on behalf of a larger cause  for those who have fought under the flag of this nation   for the young veterans i meet when i visit walter reed  for those like john mccain who have endured physical torment in service to our country   no further proof of such sacrifice is necessary  and let me also add that no one should ever devalue that service  especially for the sake of a political campaign  and that goes for supporters on both sides  we must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform  period  indeed  one of the good things to emerge from the current conflict in iraq has been the widespread recognition that whether you support this war or oppose it  the sacrifice of our troops is always worthy of honor  for the rest of us   for those of us not in uniform or without loved ones in the military   the call to sacrifice for the country's greater good remains an imperative of citizenship  sadly  in recent years  in the midst of war on two fronts  this call to service never came  after   we were asked to shop  the wealthiest among us saw their tax obligations decline  even as the costs of war continued to mount  rather than work together to reduce our dependence on foreign oil  and thereby lessen our vulnerability to a volatile region  our energy policy remained unchanged  and our oil dependence only grew  in spite of this absence of leadership from washington  i have seen a new generation of americans begin to take up the call  i meet them everywhere i go  young people involved in the project of american renewal  not only those who have signed up to fight for our country in distant lands  but those who are fighting for a better america here at home  by teaching in underserved schools  or caring for the sick in understaffed hospitals  or promoting more sustainable energy policies in their local communities  i believe one of the tasks of the next administration is to ensure that this movement towards service grows and sustains itself in the years to come  we should expand americorps and grow the peace corps  we should encourage national service by making it part of the requirement for a new college assistance program  even as we strengthen the benefits for those whose sense of duty has already led them to serve in our military  we must remember  though  that true patriotism cannot be forced or legislated with a mere set of government programs  instead  it must reside in the hearts of our people  and cultivated in the heart of our culture  and nurtured in the hearts of our children  as we begin our fourth century as a nation  it is easy to take the extraordinary nature of america for granted  but it is our responsibility as americans and as parents to instill that history in our children  both at home and at school  the loss of quality civic education from so many of our classrooms has left too many young americans without the most basic knowledge of who our forefathers are  or what they did  or the significance of the founding documents that bear their names  too many children are ignorant of the sheer effort  the risks and sacrifices made by previous generations  to ensure that this country survived war and depression  through the great struggles for civil  and social  and worker's rights  it is up to us  then  to teach them  it is up to us to teach them that even though we have faced great challenges and made our share of mistakes  we have always been able to come together and make this nation stronger  and more prosperous  and more united  and more just  it is up to us to teach them that america has been a force for good in the world  and that other nations and other people have looked to us as the last  best hope of earth  it is up to us to teach them that it is good to give back to one's community  that it is honorable to serve in the military  that it is vital to participate in our democracy and make our voices heard  and it is up to us to teach our children a lesson that those of us in politics too often forget  that patriotism involves not only defending this country against external threat  but also working constantly to make america a better place for future generations  when we pile up mountains of debt for the next generation to absorb  or put off changes to our energy policies  knowing full well the potential consequences of inaction  we are placing our short term interests ahead of the nation's long term well being  when we fail to educate effectively millions of our children so that they might compete in a global economy  or we fail to invest in the basic scientific research that has driven innovation in this country  we risk leaving behind an america that has fallen in the ranks of the world  just as patriotism involves each of us making a commitment to this nation that extends beyond our own immediate self interest  so must that commitment extends beyond our own time here on earth  our greatest leaders have always understood this  they've defined patriotism with an eye toward posterity  george washington is rightly revered for his leadership of the continental army  but one of his greatest acts of patriotism was his insistence on stepping down after two terms  thereby setting a pattern for those that would follow  reminding future presidents that this is a government of and by and for the people  abraham lincoln did not simply win a war or hold the union together  in his unwillingness to demonize those against whom he fought  in his refusal to succumb to either the hatred or self righteousness that war can unleash  in his ultimate insistence that in the aftermath of war the nation would no longer remain half slave and half free  and his trust in the better angels of our nature   he displayed the wisdom and courage that sets a standard for patriotism  and it was the most famous son of independence  harry s truman  who sat in the white house during his final days in office and said in his farewell address   when franklin roosevelt died  i felt there must be a million men better qualified than i  to take up the presidential task but through all of it  through all the years i have worked here in this room  i have been well aware than i did not really work alone   that you were working with me  no president could ever hope to lead our country  or to sustain the burdens of this office  save the people helped with their support  in the end  it may be this quality that best describes patriotism in my mind   not just a love of america in the abstract  but a very particular love for  and faith in  the american people  that is why our heart swells with pride at the sight of our flag  why we shed a tear as the lonely notes of taps sound  for we know that the greatness of this country   its victories in war  its enormous wealth  its scientific and cultural achievements   all result from the energy and imagination of the american people  their toil  drive  struggle  restlessness  humor and quiet heroism  that is the liberty we defend   the liberty of each of us to pursue our own dreams  that is the equality we seek   not an equality of results  but the chance of every single one of us to make it if we try  that is the community we strive to build   one in which we trust in this sometimes messy democracy of ours  one in which we continue to insist that there is nothing we cannot do when we put our mind to it  one in which we see ourselves as part of a larger story  our own fates wrapped up in the fates of those who share allegiance to america's happy and singular creed  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless the united states of america "], ["obama1", "you know  faith based groups like east side community ministry carry a particular meaning for me  because in a way  they're what led me into public service  it was a catholic group called the campaign for human development that helped fund the work i did many years ago in chicago to help lift up neighborhoods that were devastated by the closure of a local steel plant  now  i didn't grow up in a particularly religious household  but my experience in chicago showed me how faith and values could be an anchor in my life  and in time  i came to see my faith as being both a personal commitment to christ and a commitment to my community  that while i could sit in church and pray all i want  i wouldn't be fulfilling god's will unless i went out and did the lord's work  there are millions of americans who share a similar view of their faith  who feel they have an obligation to help others  and they're making a difference in communities all across this country   through initiatives like ready work  which is helping ensure that ex offenders don't return to a life of crime  or catholic charities  which is feeding the hungry and making sure we don't have homeless veterans sleeping on the streets of chicago  or the good work that's being done by a coalition of religious groups to rebuild new orleans  you see  while these groups are often made up of folks who've come together around a common faith  they're usually working to help people of all faiths or of no faith at all  and they're particularly well placed to offer help  as i've said many times  i believe that change comes not from the top down  but from the bottom up  and few are closer to the people than our churches  synagogues  temples  and mosques  that's why washington needs to draw on them  the fact is  the challenges we face today   from saving our planet to ending poverty   are simply too big for government to solve alone  we need all hands on deck  i'm not saying that faith based groups are an alternative to government or secular nonprofits  and i'm not saying that they're somehow better at lifting people up  what i'm saying is that we all have to work together   christian and jew  hindu and muslim  believer and non believer alike   to meet the challenges of the  st century  now  i know there are some who bristle at the notion that faith has a place in the public square  but the fact is  leaders in both parties have recognized the value of a partnership between the white house and faith based groups  president clinton signed legislation that opened the door for faith based groups to play a role in a number of areas  including helping people move from welfare to work  al gore proposed a partnership between washington and faith based groups to provide more support for the least of these  and president bush came into office with a promise to  rally the armies of compassion  establishing a new office of faith based and community initiatives  but what we saw instead was that the office never fulfilled its promise  support for social services to the poor and the needy have been consistently underfunded  rather than promoting the cause of all faith based organizations  former officials in the office have described how it was used to promote partisan interests  as a result  the smaller congregations and community groups that were supposed to be empowered ended up getting short changed  well  i still believe it's a good idea to have a partnership between the white house and grassroots groups  both faith based and secular  but it has to be a real partnership   not a photo op  that's what it will be when i'm president  i'll establish a new council for faith based and neighborhood partnerships  the new name will reflect a new commitment  this council will not just be another name on the white house organization chart   it will be a critical part of my administration  now  make no mistake  as someone who used to teach constitutional law  i believe deeply in the separation of church and state  but i don't believe this partnership will endanger that idea   so long as we follow a few basic principles  first  if you get a federal grant  you can't use that grant money to proselytize to the people you help and you can't discriminate against them   or against the people you hire   on the basis of their religion  second  federal dollars that go directly to churches  temples  and mosques can only be used on secular programs  and we'll also ensure that taxpayer dollars only go to those programs that actually work  with these principles as a guide  my council for faith based and neighborhood partnerships will strengthen faith based groups by making sure they know the opportunities open to them to build on their good works  too often  faith based groups   especially smaller congregations and those that aren't well connected   don't know how to apply for federal dollars  or how to navigate a government website to see what grants are available  or how to comply with federal laws and regulations  we rely too much on conferences in washington  instead of getting technical assistance to the people who need it on the ground  what this means is that what's stopping many faith based groups from helping struggling families is simply a lack of knowledge about how the system works  well  that will change when i'm president  i will empower the nonprofit religious and community groups that do understand how this process works to train the thousands of groups that don't  we'll  train the trainers  by giving larger faith based partners like catholic charities and lutheran services and secular nonprofits like public private ventures the support they need to help other groups build and run effective programs  every house of worship that wants to run an effective program and that's willing to abide by our constitution   from the largest mega churches and synagogues to the smallest store front churches and mosques   can and will have access to the information and support they need to run that program  this council will also help target our efforts to meet key challenges like education  all across america  too many children simply can't read or perform math at their grade level  a problem that grows worse for low income students during the summer months and afterschool hours  nonprofits like children's defense fund are working to solve this problem  they hold summer and afterschool freedom schools in communities across this country  and many of their classes are held in churches  there's a lot of evidence that these kinds of partnerships work  take youth education for tomorrow  an innovative program that's being run by churches  faith based schools  and others in philadelphia  to help narrow the summer learning gap  the yet program hires qualified teachers who help students with reading using proven learning techniques  they hold classes four days a week after school and during the summer  and they monitor progress closely  the results have been outstanding  children who attended a yet center for at least six months improved nearly   years in reading ability  and the average high school student gained a full grade in reading level after just three months  that's the kind of real progress that can be made when we empower faith based organizations  and that's why as president  i'll expand summer programs like this to serve one million students  this won't just help our children learn  it will help keep them off the streets during the summer so they don't turn to crime  and my council for faith based and neighborhood partnerships will also have a broader role   it will help set our national agenda  because if we are going to do something about the injustice of millions of children living in extreme poverty  we need interfaith coalitions like the let justice roll campaign standing up for the powerless  if we're going to end genocide and stop the scourge of hiv aids  we need people of faith on capitol hill talking about how these challenges don't just represent a security crisis or a humanitarian crisis  but a moral crisis as well  we know that faith and values can be a source of strength in our own lives  that's what it's been to me  and that's what it is to so many americans  but it can also be something more  it can be the foundation of a new project of american renewal  and that's the kind of effort i intend to lead as president of the united states "], ["obama1", "in two days  we will celebrate america's independence day  we'll come together with family and friends to enjoy a day off  maybe you'll cook out  watch a parade or take in some fireworks  hopefully  you'll get a break from things like politics  but i'm sure there will be a moment or two  when the fireworks grow quiet or the parade has gone by  when the enormity of the american accomplishment will sink in  along with a deep pride in your place in the story of the united states america  i hope you take that moment to think about what you can do to shape the future of this country we love  these days  it's easy for us to get caught thinking that there are two different stories at work in our lives  there is the story of our day to day cares and responsibilities   the classes you have to take or the bills you have to pay  the bustle and busyness of what happens in your own life  and then there is the story of what's happening in the wider world   a story seen in headlines and websites and televised images  a story experienced only through the price you pay at the pump or the extra screening you pass through at the airport  this is the divide that separates you from the ability to shape your own destiny  so i am asking you   on this  th of july   to reject that divide  to step into the strong currents of history  and to shape your country's future  because your own story and the american story are not separate  they are shared  and they will both be enriched if together  we answer a new call to service to meet the challenges of our new century  i say this to you as someone who couldn't be standing here today if not for the service of others  and who wouldn't be standing here if not for the purpose that service gave my own life  you see  i spent much of my childhood adrift  my father left my mother and me when i was two  my mother remarried  and we lived in indonesia for a time  but i was mostly raised in hawaii by my mom and my grandparents from kansas  growing up  i wasn't always sure who i was  or where i was going  but during my first two years of college  perhaps because the values my mother had taught me  hard work  honesty  empathy   had resurfaced after a long hibernation  or perhaps because of the example of wonderful teachers and lasting friends  i began to notice a world beyond myself  and by the time i graduated from college  i was possessed with a crazy idea   that i would work at a grassroots level to bring about change  i wrote letters to every organization in the country i could think of  and one day  a small group of churches on the south side of chicago offered me a job working to help neighborhoods that had been devastated by steel plant closings  my mother and grandparents wanted me to go to law school  my friends were applying to jobs on wall street  meanwhile  this organization offered me   a year plus   for an old  beat up car  and i said yes  i didn't know a soul in chicago  and i wasn't sure what was waiting for me there  i had always been inspired by stories of the civil rights movement and jfk's call to service  but when i got to the south side  there were no marches  and no soaring speeches  in the shadow of an empty steel plant  there were just a lot of folks who were struggling  i still remember one of the very first meetings we put together to discuss gang violence with a group of community leaders  we waited and waited for people to show up  and finally  a group of older people walked into the hall  and they sat down  and a little old lady raised her hand and asked   is this where the bingo game is  it wasn't easy  but eventually  we made progress  day by day  block by block  we brought the community together  we registered new voters  we set up after school programs  fought for new jobs  and helped people live lives with more opportunity  and some measure of dignity  but i also began to realize that i wasn't just helping other people  through service  i found a community that embraced me  citizenship that was meaningful  the direction i'd been seeking  through service  i discovered how my own improbable story fit into the larger story of america  there is a lesson to be learned from generations who have served   from soldiers and sailors  airmen and marines  suffragists and freedom riders  teachers and doctors  cops and firefighters  it's the lesson that in america  each of us is free to seek our own dreams  but we must also serve a common purpose  a higher purpose  when you choose to serve   whether it's your nation  your community  or simply your neighbor   you are connected to that fundamental american ideal that we want life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness not just for ourselves  but for all americans  that is why this is a great nation  because time and again  americans have been willing to serve on stages both great and small  to draw on the same spirit that launched america's improbable journey to meet the challenges of each defining moment in our history  one of those moments came on september     whether you lived in manhattan or thousands of miles away in colorado  you felt the pain and loss of that day not just as an individual  but as an american  you also felt pride   pride in the firefighters who rushed up the stairs while workers rushed down  pride in the police who provided comfort  and the neighbors who lent a hand  pride in your citizenship  and the tattered flag that flew at ground zero  that's why americans lined up to give blood  that's why we held vigils and flew flags  that's why we rallied behind our president  we were ready to step into the strong current of history  and to answer a new call for our country  but the call never came  instead of a call to service  we were asked to go shopping  instead of a call for shared sacrifice  we gave tax cuts to the wealthiest americans in a time of war for the very first time in our history  instead of leadership that called us to come together  we got patriotism defined as the property of one party  and used as a political wedge to take us into a war that should have never been authorized and never been waged  we have lost precious time  our nation is less secure and less respected in the world  our energy dependence has risen  and so has the specter of climate change  more of our children have been left behind  and our american dream risks slipping away  the burden of service has fallen on to the backs of our military   and their families   who have endured tour after tour of duty bravely and brilliantly  even though they haven't always gotten the care and support they have earned  when i was thinking about whether or not to seek the presidency  there were voices that counseled me to wait  why not stay in washington for a few more years  they said  to master the game  but the fact is  i had been in washington long enough to know that it needs to change  i am running for president  right now  because of what dr  king called the fierce urgency of now  this moment is too important to sit on the sidelines  our country faces determined enemies abroad  and definitive challenges at home  but i have no doubt that in the face of these odds  people who love their country can change it  that is why i am running for president  that is why i'm determined to reach out   not just to democrats  but to independents and republicans who want to move in a new direction  and that is why i won't just ask for your vote as a candidate   i will ask for your service and your active citizenship when i am president of the united states  this will not be a call issued in one speech or one program   this will be a central cause of my presidency  we will ask americans to serve  we will create new opportunities for americans to serve  and we will direct that service to our most pressing national challenges  there is no challenge greater than the defense of our nation and our values  the men and women of our military   from fort carson to peterson air force base  from the air force academy to the rotc students here on campus   have signed up at a time when our troops face an ever increasing load  fighting a resurgent taliban  targeting al qaeda  persevering in the deserts and cities of iraq  training foreign militaries  delivering humanitarian relief  in this young century  our military has answered when called  even as that call has come too often  through their commitment  their capability  and their courage they have done us all proud  but we need to ease the burden on our troops  while meeting the challenges of the  st century  that's why i will call on a new generation of americans to join our military  and complete the effort to increase our ground forces by   soldiers and   marines  a call to service must be backed by a sacred trust with anyone who puts on the uniform of the united states  a young person joining our military must know that we'll only send them into harm's way when we absolutely must  that we'll provide them with the equipment needed to complete their mission safely  and deployments that allow adequate time back home  they must see that we'll care for our military families while they're deployed  and that we're providing our veterans with the support  benefits  and opportunity that they have earned when they return home  that's what i've fought for on the senate veteran's affairs committee  that's what i'll promise as commander in chief  just as we must value and encourage military service across our society  we must honor and expand other opportunities to serve  because the future of our nation depends on the soldier at fort carson  but it also depends on the teacher in east la  the nurse in appalachia  the after school worker in new orleans  the peace corps volunteer in africa  and the foreign service officer in indonesia  americans have shown that they want to step up  but we're not keeping pace with the demand of those who want to serve  or leveraging that commitment to meet national challenges  fdr not only enlisted americans to create employment  he targeted that service to build our infrastructure and conserve our environment  jfk not only called on a new generation  he made their service a bridge to the developing world  and a bright light of american values in the darkest days of the cold war  today  americorps   our nation's network of local  state and national service programs   has   slots  i know firsthand the quality of these programs  my wife michelle once left her job at a law firm to be the founding director of an americorps program in chicago that trains young people for careers in public service  these programs invest americans in their communities and their country  they tap america's greatest resource   our citizens  as president  i will expand americorps to   slots  and make that increased service a vehicle to meet national goals like providing health care and education  saving our planet and restoring our standing in the world  so that citizens see their efforts connected to a common purpose  people of all ages  stations  and skills will be asked to serve  because when it comes to the challenges we face  the american people are not the problem   they are the answer  we'll send more college graduates to teach and mentor our young people  we'll call on americans to join an energy corps to conduct renewable energy and environmental cleanup projects in their neighborhoods  we'll enlist veterans to help other vets find jobs and support  and to be there for our military families  and we'll also grow our foreign service  open consulates that have been shuttered  and double the size of the peace corps by   to renew our diplomacy  and we'll use technology to connect people to service  we'll expand usa freedom corps to create an online network where americans can browse opportunities to volunteer  you'll be able to search by category  time commitment  and skill sets  you'll be able to rate service opportunities  build service networks  and create your own service pages to track your hours and activities  this will empower more americans to craft their own service agenda  and make their own change from the bottom up  we also need to invest in ideas that can help us meet our common challenges  because more often than not  the next great social innovation won't be generated by the government  the non profit sector employs   in   americans and   nonprofits are launched every day  yet while the federal government invests   billion in research and development for the private sector  there is no similar effort to support non profit innovation  meanwhile  there are ideas across america   in our inner cities and small towns  from college graduates  to seniors getting ready to retire   that could benefit millions of americans if they're given the chance to grow  as president  i will launch a new social investment fund network  it's time to get the grass roots  the foundations  the faith based organizations  the private sector and the government at the table so that we can learn from our own success stories  we'll invest in ideas that work  leverage private sector dollars to encourage innovation  and expand successful programs to scale  take a program like the harlem children's zone  which helps thousands of kids in new york through after school activities  mentoring  and family support  we need to make that model work in different cities across america  and just as we support small businesses  i'll start a new social entrepreneur agency to make sure that small non profits have strong support from washington  finally  we need to integrate service into education  so that young americans are called upon and prepared to be active citizens  just as we teach math and writing  arts and athletics  we need to teach young americans to take citizenship seriously  study after study shows that students who serve do better in school  are more likely to go to college  and more likely to maintain that service as adults  so when i'm president  i will set a goal for all american middle and high school students to perform   hours of service a year  and for all college students to perform   hours of service a year  this means that by the time you graduate college  you'll have done   weeks of service  we'll reach this goal in several ways  at the middle and high school level  we'll make federal assistance conditional on school districts developing service programs  and give schools resources to offer new service opportunities  at the community level  we'll develop public private partnerships so students can serve more outside the classroom  for college students  i have proposed an annual american opportunity tax credit of   to receive this credit  we'll require   hours of public service  you invest in america  and america invests in you   that's how we're going to make sure that college is affordable for every single american  while preparing our nation to compete in the  st century  for our veterans  i was proud to be a strong and early supporter of jim webb's bipartisan gi bill  so that today's vets have the same opportunity that my grandfather had under the gi bill  to marshal their talents in building a new energy economy  i will launch an initiative to give our veterans the training they need to succeed in the green jobs of the future  it's time to end our energy dependence at home so our national security isn't held hostage to oil and gas from abroad  and we will not leave out the nearly   million young americans who are out of school and out of work  we'll enlist them in our energy corps  so that disadvantaged young people can find useful work  clean polluted areas  help weatherize homes  and gain skills in a growing industry  and we'll expand the youthbuild program  which puts young americans to work building affordable housing in america's poorest communities  giving them valuable skills and a chance to complete a high school education  because no one should be left out of the american story  now i know what the cynics will say  i've heard from them all my life  these are the voices that will tell you   not just what you can't do   but what you won't do  americans won't come together   our allegiance doesn't go beyond our political party  region  or congregation  young americans won't serve their country   they're too selfish  or too lazy  this is the soft sell of the status quo  the voice that tells you to settle because settling isn't that bad  that's not the america that i've seen throughout this campaign  i've seen young people work  and volunteer  and turn out in record numbers  i've met members of our military   like the thousands of soldiers and airmen here in colorado springs   who signed up to serve in the wake of   i've met community workers who want to care for our kids  students who want to end the genocide in darfur  businesses that want to expand opportunity  farmers who want to help free us from the tyranny of oil  seniors searching for ways to give back  and people of every age  race  and religion who want to come together to renew the american spirit  renewing that spirit starts with service  make no mistake  our destiny as americans is tied up with one another  if we are less respected in the world  then you will be less safe  if we keep paying dictators for foreign oil  gas prices are going to keep rising  and so are the oceans  if we can't give all of our kids a world class education  then our economy is going to fall behind  and that's how it should be  that's the bet our founding fathers were making all of those years ago   that our individual destinies could be tied together in the common destiny of democracy  that government depends not just on the consent of the governed  but on the service of citizens  that's what history calls us to do  because loving your country shouldn't just mean watching fireworks on the  th of july  loving your country must mean accepting your responsibility to do your part to change it  if you do  your life will be richer  and our country will be stronger  we need your service  right now  at this moment   our moment   in history  i'm not going to tell you what your role should be  that's for you to discover  but i am going to ask you to play your part  ask you to stand up  ask you to put your foot firmly into the current of history  i am asking you to change history's course  and if i have the fortune to be your president  decades from now   when the memory of this or that policy has faded  and when the words that we will speak in the next few years are long forgotten   i hope you remember this as a moment when your own story and the american story came together  and   in the words of dr  king   the arch of history bent once more towards justice "], ["obama1", "tomorrow  we'll mark the  th of july with barbecues and parades  fireworks and time off with loved ones  we'll also have the opportunity to give thanks for our troops and veterans  their sacrifice has made possible the freedom that we enjoy  and keeping faith with those who serve must always be a core american value and a cornerstone of american patriotism  because america's commitment to its servicemen and women begins at enlistment  and it must never end  without that commitment  i might not be here today  my grandfather   stanley dunham   enlisted after pearl harbor and went on to march in patton's army  my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line while he was gone  and my mother was born at fort leavenworth  when he returned  it was to a country that gave him the chance to go to college on the gi bill  to buy his first home with a loan from the fha  to move his family west  all the way to hawaii  where he and my grandmother helped raise me  today  my grandfather is buried in the punchbowl  the national memorial cemetery of the pacific  where   victims of pearl harbor are laid to rest  i knew him when he was older  but whenever i meet young men and women along the campaign trail who are serving in the military today  i think about what my grandfather was like when he enlisted   a fresh faced man of twenty three  with a hearty laugh and an easy smile  these sons and daughters of america are the best and the bravest among us  when our troops go into battle  they serve no faction or party  they represent no race or region  they are simply americans  they serve and fight and bleed together out of loyalty not just to a place on a map or a certain kind of people  but to a set of ideals that we have been striving for since the first shots rang out at lexington and concord   the idea that america could be governed not by men  but by laws  that we could be equal in the eyes of those laws  that we could be free to say what we want and write what we want and worship as we please  that we could have the right to pursue our individual dreams  but the obligation to help our fellow citizens pursue theirs  allegiance to these ideals has always been at the core of american patriotism   it's what unites a country of so many different opinions and beliefs  at the same time  we must never forget that honoring these ideals must mean honoring the men and women who defend them in the uniform of the united states  this requires more than saluting our veterans as they march by in a  th of july parade  it requires only sending them to war when we must  and giving them the equipment they need to complete their mission safely  it requires giving them the care and benefits they have earned  and it requires standing shoulder to shoulder with our veterans and their families after the guns fall silent and the cameras are turned off  we know that over the last eight years  we've often fallen short of meeting this test  we learned about the deplorable conditions that were discovered at places like fort bragg and walter reed  we've walked by a veteran whose home is now a cardboard box on a street corner in the richest nation on earth  we've heard about what it's like to navigate the broken bureaucracy of the va   the impossibly long lines  or the repeated calls for help that get you nothing more than an answering machine  it doesn't have to be this way  not in this country  there are many aspects of the war in iraq that have gone inalterably wrong  but caring for our veterans is one thing we can still get right  when i arrived in the senate  i sought out a seat on the veterans affairs committee so i could fight to serve our veterans as well as they have served us  we fought to make sure that the claims of disabled veterans in illinois and other states were being heard fairly  we passed laws to get homeless veterans off the streets and to prevent at risk veterans from getting there in the first place  i led a bipartisan effort to improve outpatient facilities at places like walter reed  and to slash red tape  and reform the disability process   because recovering troops should go to the front of the line  and they shouldn't have to fight to get there  and we passed laws to give family members health care while they care for injured troops  and a year of job protection so they never have to face a choice between caring for a loved one and keeping a job  but there is so much more work that we need to do in this country  we have much further to go to keep our sacred trust with the men and women who serve  that's why i've pledged to build a  st century va as president  it means no more red tape   it's time to give every service member electronic copies of medical and service records upon discharge  it means no more shortfalls   we'll fully fund va health care  and add more vet centers  particularly in rural areas  it means no more delays   we'll pass on time budgets  it means no more means testing   it's time to allow every veteran into the va system  and it means we'll have a simple principle for veterans sleeping on our streets  zero tolerance  as president  i'll build on the work i started in the senate and expand housing vouchers  and launch a new supportive services housing program to prevent at risk veterans and their families from sliding into homelessness  i'll also build on the work i did in the senate to confront one of the signature injuries of the wars in iraq and afghanistan   posttraumatic stress disorder  we have to understand that for far too many troops and their families  the war doesn't end when they come home  but only half of troops returning with ptsd receive the treatment they need  think of how many we turn away   of how many we let fall through the cracks  of how many suffer in silence  we have to do better than this  in the senate  i've helped lead a bipartisan effort to stop the unfair practice of kicking out troops who suffer from ptsd  and when i'm president  we'll enhance mental health screening and treatment at all levels  we also need more mental health professionals  more training to recognize signs and to reject the stigma of seeking care  and we need to dramatically improve screening and treatment for the other signature injury of the war  traumatic brain injury  that's why i passed measures in the senate to increase screening for these injuries  and that's why i'll establish clearer standards of care as president  we have called on our troops and their families for so much during these last years  but we haven't always issued that call responsibly  we need to restore twelve month army deployments  but we also need to restore adequate training and time at home between those deployments  my wife  michelle  recently met with army spouses in north carolina who told her about the toll it takes to have your loved one leave for tour after tour of duty  and they told her something we all need to remember   we don't just deploy our troops overseas  we deploy families  that's why we also need to provide more counseling and resources to help families cope with multiple tours  that's what we owe our military families who have sacrificed so much for us  and when our loved ones do come home  it is time for the united states of america to offer this generation of returning heroes the same thanks we offered that earlier  greatest generation   by giving every veteran the same opportunity that my grandfather had under the gi bill  that's why i was proud to be a strong supporter of the  st century gi bill that was introduced by my friend senator jim webb  this bill will provide every returning veteran with a real chance to afford a college education  and it won't harm retention  the brave americans who fight today believe deeply in this country  and no matter how many you meet  or how many stories of heroism you hear  every encounter reminds that they are truly special  that through their service  they are living out the ideals that stir so many of us as americans   pride  duty  and sacrifice  some of the most inspiring are those you meet at places like walter reed army medical center  they are young men and women who may have lost a limb or even their ability to take care of themselves  but they will never lose the pride they feel for their country  it's this classically american optimism that makes you realize the quality of person we have serving in the united states armed forces  this  after all  is what led them to wear the uniform in the first place   their unwavering belief in the idea of america  the idea that no matter where you come from  or what you look like  or who your parents are  this is a place where anything is possible  where anyone can make it  where we look out for each other  and take care of each other  where we rise and fall as one nation   as one people  it's an idea that's worth fighting for   an idea for which so many americans have given that last full measure of devotion  i can still remember the day that we laid my grandfather to rest  in a cemetery lined with the graves of americans who have sacrificed for our country  we heard the solemn notes of taps and the crack of guns fired in salute  we watched as a folded flag was handed to my grandmother  it was a nation's final act of service and gratitude to stanley dunham   an america that stood by my grandfather when he took off the uniform  and never left his side  abraham lincoln once said   i like to see a man proud of the place in which he lives  but i also like to see a man live so that his place will be proud of him  there is no doubt that we are a nation that is deeply proud of where we live  but it is now our task to live in a way that stanley dunham lived  to live the way that those heroes at walter reed have lived  it is now our task to live so that america will be proud of us  that is the true test of patriotism   the test that all of us must meet in the days and years to come  so as we mark this independence day  let us rededicate ourselves to meeting that challenge  and to serving those who have worn the uniform of the united states as well as they have served us "], ["obama1", "i've often said that this election represents a defining moment in our history  on major issues like the war in iraq or the warming of our planet  the decisions we make in november and over the next few years will shape a generation  if not a century  that is especially true when it comes to our economy  most of you already know this   not just because you see headlines about job loss and foreclosures and recession  but because you feel the effects of all this in your own lives  you're working harder than ever to pay bills that are getting bigger than ever and there's not much left over at the end of the month  you're trying to juggle the demands of work and family  you're driving less and saving less  you're worried about the value of your home and whether you'll be able to afford college for your kids and still retire at a decent age  for millions of families  these everyday worries and long term anxieties have grown considerably worse over the last year  but they are rooted in fundamental changes in our economy that began years earlier  over the last few decades  revolutions in technology and communication have made it so that corporations can send good jobs anywhere in the world there's an internet connection  children in charlotte aren't just competing for the same good jobs with children from boston  but with children in bangalore and beijing as well  two income families haven't just become more common  they've become a necessity to keep up with rising costs and wages that haven't grown  but as our world and our economy have changed  only washington has stood still  the progress we made during the  s was quickly reversed by an administration with a single philosophy that is as old as it is misguided  reward not work  not success  but pure wealth  give massive tax breaks to big corporations and multimillionaires and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  sacrifice investments in health care and education and energy and technology to pay for these tax breaks  and borrow the rest from countries like china  leaving our children to foot the bill  well it's painfully clear by now how badly this strategy has failed  and this is a fundamental issue in this campaign  because senator mccain and i have very different views of where our economy is today  and where we need to go  senator mccain said earlier this year that america has made  great progress economically  over the past eight years  he believes we're on the right track  and he's launching a new economic tour today with policies that are very much the same as those we have seen from the bush administration  in fact  the central component of senator mccain's economic plan is   billion more in tax cuts for big corporations and multimillionaires   less than a quarter of which will benefit the   of american families that make up the bulk of our middle class  less than a quarter  under senator mccain's economic plan  exxon mobil   a company that recently reported the biggest profit in history   would get   billion in tax breaks  while less than a quarter of the benefits would go to the middle class  what's worse   he has no concrete plan to pay for these tax breaks  so his policies would actually add more than   or   trillion to the national debt over the next decade and weaken our economy even further  if this sounds familiar  it's because it's exactly what george bush has done for the last eight years  it hasn't worked  it won't work  and it is time to try something new  i won't stand here and pretend that we can or should undo the economic transformations that have taken place over the last few decades  there are jobs that aren't coming back and this world will always be more competitive  but i do believe that if all of us are willing to share the burdens and benefits of this new economy  then all of us will prosper   not just because government makes it so  but because we're willing to take responsibility as individuals to work harder and think more and innovate further  i believe this because i know that in america  our prosperity has always risen from the bottom up  from the earliest days of our founding  it has been the hard work and ingenuity of our people that's served as the wellspring of our economic strength  that's why we built a system of free public high schools when we transitioned from a nation of farms to a nation of factories  that's why we sent my grandfather's generation to college on the gi bill  which helped create the largest middle class in history  that's why we've invested in the science and research that have led to new discoveries and entire new industries  and that's what this country will do again when i am president of the united states the other week i laid out what america needs to do to remain competitive in the  st century  it's an agenda that will require us first and foremost to train and educate our workforce with the skills necessary to compete in a knowledge based economy  we'll also need to place a greater emphasis on areas like science and technology that will define the workforce of the  st century  and invest in the research and innovation necessary to create the jobs and industries of the future right here in america  one place where that investment would make an enormous difference is in a renewable energy policy that ends our addiction on foreign oil  provides real long term relief from high fuel costs  and builds a green economy that could create up to five million well paying jobs that can't be outsourced  we can also create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our schools  roads  bridges  and other critical infrastructure that needs repair  and because we know that we can't or shouldn't put up walls around our economy  a long term agenda will also find a way to make trade work for american workers  we do the cause of free trade   a cause i believe in   no good when we pass trade agreements that hand out favors to special interests and do little to help workers who have to watch their factories close down  there is nothing protectionist about demanding that trade spreads the benefits of globalization as broadly as possible  those are the steps we can take to grow our economy and stay competitive as a nation  but today  i want to talk about my plan to not only ensure the economic security of middle class families in the short term  but to give them the chance to achieve economic success in the long term  to make sure that americans aren't just getting by  but getting ahead   that they're able to get a world class education  build a nest egg and provide a better life for their children  we can make this new economy work for us if we finally change course in november  the first step is to offer immediate relief to families who are struggling right now while helping to jumpstart economic growth and create jobs  between a sluggish economy and gas prices rising above   a gallon  the american people cannot wait another six months for help  instead of washington gimmicks like a three month gas tax holiday that will only pad oil company profits  we need to do what i called for months ago and pass a second stimulus package that provides energy rebate checks for working families  a fund to help families avoid foreclosure  and increased assistance for states that have been hard hit by the economic downturn  a few days ago i called on senator mccain and all members of congress to come together   republicans and democrats   in support of this   billion stimulus package  there are many policies we'll disagree on  but immediate relief for families who are struggling shouldn't be one of them  and so while i haven't received a response from senator mccain yet  i look forward to hearing one soon  the second step in my agenda is to help provide economic security for families who've been dealing with skyrocketing costs and stagnant wages for years  i believe it's time to reform our tax code so that it rewards work and not just wealth  so when i'm president  i'll shut down the corporate loopholes and tax havens  and i'll use the money to help pay for a middle class tax cut that will provide   of relief to   of workers and their families  we'll also eliminate income taxes for every retiree making less than   per year  because every senior deserves to live out their life in dignity and respect  and if senator mccain wants a debate about taxes in this campaign  that's a debate i'm happy to have  because if you're a family making less than   my plan will not raise your taxes   not your income taxes  not your payroll taxes  not your capital gains taxes  not any of your taxes  in fact  what senator mccain should explain is why his tax cut for the middle class would leave out   million households  and why  for families that are lucky enough to get the tax cut  it would be worth only about   in the first year  the difference is   he trusts that prosperity will trickle down from corporations and the wealthiest few to everyone else  i believe that it's the hard work of middle class americans that fuels this nation's prosperity  i'll also help families who are struggling under the crushing burden of health care costs by passing a plan that brings the typical family's premiums down by   and guarantees coverage to everyone who wants it  senator mccain's health care plan not only fails to cover every american and holds out less hope of cutting health care costs  it would actually tax your health care benefits for the first time ever  over time this tax would grow and after just a few years it would be so large that middle class families would face an overall tax increase from his plans  so that is a real choice in this election  as we help families deal with rising costs  we also have to help those families who find themselves mired in debt  since so many who are struggling to keep up with their mortgages are now shifting their debt to credit cards  we have to make sure that credit cards don't become the next stage in the housing crisis because  once again  we failed to establish basic rules and oversight to protect consumers from predatory lending to make sure that americans know what they're signing up for  i'll institute a five star rating system to inform consumers about the level of risk involved in every credit card  and we'll establish a credit card bill of rights that will ban unilateral changes to credit card agreements  ban rate hikes on debt you already had  and ban interest charges on late fees  americans need to pay what they owe  but you should pay what's fair  not just what fattens profits for some credit card company and they can get away with  the same principle should apply to our bankruptcy laws  when i'm president  we'll reform our bankruptcy laws so that we give americans who find themselves in debt a second chance  and we'll make sure that if you can demonstrate that you went bankrupt because of medical expenses  you can relieve that debt and get back on your feet  but even as we take these steps  we also know that it's not enough to just get families back on their feet  we need to help hardworking families get ahead  we need to help the middle class succeed because that's when our economy succeeds  that's why the third step in my agenda is to give families the help they need to build that nest egg and provide a better life for their children  to make saving easier  we'll automatically enroll every worker in a workplace pension plan that stays with you from job to job  and for working families who earn under   we will start that nest egg for you by matching   percent of the first   you save and depositing it directly into your account  to make a college education affordable for every american family  i'll make this promise to every student   your country will offer you   a year of tuition if you offer your country community or national service when you graduate  if you invest in america  america will invest in you  to make it easier for families to own their own home and stay in that home  we'll crack down on predatory lenders  and help more americans refinance their mortgages  and provide ten million homeowners a mortgage tax credit that will take ten percent off their interest rate  to help those mothers and fathers who are juggling work and family  i'll expand the child care tax credit  extend the family medical leave act to give more parents more time with their children  and make sure that every worker in america has access to seven days of paid sick leave  i'll make sure that women get equal pay for an equal day's work  because that's what's right and that's what families need to get ahead  and to help those families who own small businesses that are the engine of prosperity in america  i will eliminate all capital gains taxes on start ups and small businesses to encourage more innovation and job creation  there is no doubt that this agenda is ambitious  it will take resources in the wake of policies our debt like a war in iraq that's costing us   billion a month  but the answer to our fiscal problems is not to short change investments that will help our families get ahead   investments that are vital to our long term growth as a nation  the answer is to make sure that we are finding a way to pay for these investments but cutting where we can  my plan is detailed and specific when it comes to cutting spending  in fact  all my new spending proposals would be more than paid for by spending reductions  i have a plan to responsibly end the war in iraq and reduce overpayments for private plans in medicare  something john mccain has no specific plan to do  i would also curb subsidies to banks making student loans  return earmarks to their   levels and reform no bid contracts  i do this because i believe we can have a smarter government that pays its way while investing in our country's future  you know  the americans i've met over the last sixteen months in town halls and living rooms  on farms and front porches   they may come from different places and have different backgrounds  but they hold common hopes and dream the same simple dreams  they know government can't solve all their problems  and they don't expect it to  they believe in personal responsibility  and hard work  and self reliance  they don't like seeing their tax dollars wasted  but we also believe in fairness and opportunity   in an america where jobs are there for the willing  where hard work is rewarded with a decent living  where no matter how much you start with or where you come from or who your parents are  you can not just get by  but actually get ahead  that's the promise of this country  and i believe we can keep that promise together if we change course and get to work in the months and years ahead  thank you "], ["obama1", "thank you  mayor  and thank you for what you do every day as one of america's finest mayors  at heart  what mayor villaraigosa is doing today is the same thing he was doing as a fifteen year old when he volunteered to take part in a grape boycott led by cesar chavez   he's fighting to make this country more equal and just  and he is a shining example of what we can achieve when we build a government that reflects the diversity of the united states of america  that's something i want to talk about because i'm told that today's theme is  diversity in government  so i've been thinking about why that's important and about what it means to have a government that represents all americans  it's not just about making sure that men and women of every race  religion  and background are represented at every level of government   though that's a critical part of it  it's not just about sending a message to our children that everyone can lead and everyone can serve   although that too is important  it's about making sure that we have a government that knows that a problem facing any american is a problem facing all americans  it's about making sure our government knows that when there's a hispanic girl stuck in a crumbling school who graduates without learning to read or doesn't graduate at all  that isn't just a hispanic american problem  that's an american problem  when hispanics lose their jobs faster than almost anybody else  or work jobs that pay less  and come with fewer benefits than almost anybody else  that isn't a hispanic american problem  that's an american problem  when   million people live in hiding in this country and hundreds of thousands of people cross our borders illegally each year  when companies hire undocumented workers instead of legal citizens to avoid paying overtime or to avoid a union  and a nursing mother is torn away from her baby by an immigration raid  that is a problem that all of us   black  white  and brown   must solve as one nation  a government that works for all americans   that's the kind of government i'm talking about  and that's the kind of government i've been fighting to build throughout my over   years in public service  it's why i reached across the aisle in the senate to fight for comprehensive immigration reform  it's why i brought democrats and republicans together in illinois to put   million in tax cuts into the pockets of hardworking families  to expand health care to   children and parents  and to help end the outrage of latinas making   cents for every dollar that many of their male coworkers make  it's why i worked with lulac and maldef as a civil rights lawyer to register latino voters and ensure that hispanics had an equal voice in city hall  and it's why i first moved to chicago after college  as some of you know  i turned down more lucrative jobs and went to work for a group of churches so i could help turn around neighborhoods that were devastated when the local steel plants closed  i knew that change in those communities would not come easy  but i also knew that it wouldn't come at all if we didn't bring people together  so i reached out to community leaders   black  brown  and white   and built a coalition on issues from failing schools to illegal dumping to unimmunized children  together  we gave job training to the jobless  helped prevent students from dropping out of school  and taught people to stand up to their government when it wasn't standing up for them  it was one of the most meaningful experiences of my life   because it showed me that what holds this country together is that fundamental belief that we all have a stake in each other  that i am my brother's keeper  i am my sister's keeper  and in this country  we rise and fall together  it's an idea that's probably familiar to all of you because it's summed up by lulac's founding creed   all for one and one for all  it's what led a group of immigrants who were tired of being sent to separate schools  and arrested for crimes they didn't commit and thrown in jail by juries they couldn't serve on  to come together and form this league nearly eighty years ago  it's what led you to take up the cause of a fallen soldier from south texas who'd returned from fighting fascism in a casket  but was denied burial beside the men he fought with and bled with because of the color of his skin  you've helped ensure that no one who's worn the proud uniform of the united states of america is denied the rights and respect they deserve  it's what led a local lulac council to forge a better future for children in houston by launching a program that not only taught them english  and helped ensure they went on to graduate  but served as the basis for the head start program that's helped lift so many children out of poverty  it's what led you to make women equal partners in the battle for civil rights long before so many other organizations did the same  and it's what's driving you today in your communities to put opportunity  equality  and justice within reach for latino families  all for one and one for all  it's the idea that's at the heart of lulac  it's the idea that's at the heart of america  and it's what this election is all about  it's about the future we can build together  it's about all the people who are paying a price because of our broken immigration system  all the communities that are taking immigration enforcement into their own hands  and all the neighborhoods that are seeing rising tensions as citizens are pit against new immigrants  they need us to put an end to the petty partisanship that passes for politics in washington and enact comprehensive immigration reform once and for all  now  i know senator mccain used to buck his party on immigration by fighting for comprehensive reform  and i admired him for it  but when he was running for his party's nomination  he abandoned his courageous stance  and said that he wouldn't even support his own legislation if it came up for a vote  well  for eight long years  we've had a president who made all kinds of promises to latinos on the campaign trail  but failed to live up to them in the white house  and we can't afford that anymore  we need a president who isn't going to walk away from something as important as comprehensive reform when it becomes politically unpopular  that's the commitment i'm making to you  i marched with you in the streets of chicago to meet our immigration challenge  i fought with you in the senate for comprehensive immigration reform  and i will make it a top priority in my first year as president   not only because we have an obligation to secure our borders and get control of who comes in and out of our country  and not only because we have to crack down on employers who are abusing undocumented immigrants instead of hiring citizens  but because we have to finally bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows  yes  they broke the law  and they should have to pay a fine  and learn english  and go to the back of the line  that's how we'll put them on a pathway to citizenship  that's how we'll finally fix our broken immigration system and avoid creating a servant class in our midst  it's time to reconcile our values and principles as a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws  that's what this election is all about  it's about the couple i met in north las vegas who saved up for decades  only to be tricked into buying a home they couldn't afford  and are now struggling to raise their four daughters  it's about all the latino families who are the first ones hurt by an economic downturn and the last ones helped by an economic upturn  they can't afford another four years of the bush economic policies that senator mccain is offering   policies that give tax breaks to big corporations and the wealthiest americans  while doing little for the struggling families who need help most  they need us to restore fairness to our economy by putting a tax cut into the pockets of workers and small business owners  by ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and giving them to companies that create good jobs here at home  by solving the housing crisis  and giving relief to struggling homeowners  and investing in infrastructure to create new jobs in the construction industry that's been so hard hit  that's what this election is about  it's about the one in three latinas who don't have health care  and the small business owners who are doing everything they can to succeed but are struggling to stay afloat because of the rising cost of health care  they cannot afford another four years of the bush health care policies that senator mccain is offering   policies that won't solve our health care crisis  but will make you pay taxes on your health care for the first time ever  they need us to stand up to the big drug and insurance companies  guarantee health insurance for anyone who needs it  make it affordable for anyone who wants it  and cut costs for business and their workers by picking up the tab for some of the most expensive illnesses and conditions  that's what this election is about  it's about the latino students who are dropping out of school faster than nearly anybody else  the mother in l a  who said she felt like the education system wasn't designed for people like her  and the children from west chicago to the south bronx who go to overflowing classes in underfunded schools taught by teachers who aren't getting the support they need  they cannot afford another four years of false promises and neglect  they need us to invest in early childhood education  stop leaving the money behind for no child left behind  recruit an army of new teachers to your communities and make college affordable for anyone who wants to go   because that's how we'll give every american the skills to compete in our global economy  and that's what this election is all about  it's about giving all americans a fair shot at the american dream  that's what most americans are looking for  it's not a lot  americans don't need government to solve all their problems  and they don't want it to  they just want to know that if they put in the work that's required  they'll be able to build a better life not just for themselves  but for their children and grandchildren  it's the idea that in this country  the only limit to success is how big you're willing to dream and how hard you're willing to work  and as my friend henry cisneros said to me the other day  nobody embodies this spirit more than the latino community  i was reminded of this a few years ago when i attended a naturalization workshop at st  pius church in pilsen  as i was walking down the aisle  i saw people clutching small american flags  waiting for their turn to be called up so they could begin the long process to become u s  citizens  and at one point  a young girl  seven or eight  came up to me with her parents  and asked for my autograph  she said her name was cristina  and that she was studying government in school  i told her parents that they should be very proud of her  and as i listened to cristina translate my words into spanish for them  it struck me that for all the noise and anger that so often clouds the discussion about immigration in this country  america has nothing to fear from our newcomers  they have come here for the same reason that families have always come here  for the same reason that my own father came here from kenya so many years ago   in the hope that here  in america  you can make it if you try  ultimately  then  the danger to the american way of life is not that we will be overrun by those who do not look like us or do not yet speak our language  it will come if we fail to recognize the humanity of cristina and her family   if we withhold from them the same opportunities we take for granted  or more broadly  if we stand idly by as our problems grow  as more and more americans go without quality jobs  affordable health care  or the skills they need to get ahead in the  st century  because america can only prosper if all americans prosper  it goes back to the idea that's at the heart of lulac   that it's all for one and one for all  that's the idea we need to reclaim in this country  and that's the idea that we can reclaim in this election  but i can't do this on my own  i need your help  this election could well be decided by latino voters  every four years some of the closest contests take place in florida  colorado  nevada  and new mexico   states with large latino communities  in     latinos who were registered to vote in new mexico didn't turn out on election day  and senator kerry lost that state by less than   votes    votes  that's a small fraction of the number of latinos who aren't even registered to vote in new mexico today  so while i know how powerful a community you are  i also know how powerful you could be on november  th if you translate your numbers into votes  during the immigration marches back in   we had a saying   today  we march  tomorrow  we vote  well  that was the time to march  and now comes the time to vote  and i truly believe that if we can register more latinos  young and old  rich and poor  and turn them out to vote in the fall   then not only will we change the political map  and not only will i win the presidency  but you will finally have a government that represents all americans  and then you and i   together   will bring about the kind of change we've been marching for and fighting for  and lift up all your communities and every corner of the united states of america "], ["obama1", " i joint event with senator hillary clinton br dnc women's leadership forum br i  thank you  hillary  and thanks to all of you for joining us here today  i want to start by saying a few words about the woman you just heard from  as someone who took the same historic journey as senator clinton   who shared a stage with her many times over those sixteen months   i know firsthand how tough she is  how passionate she is  how committed she is to the causes that bring us here today  i know that what drives her today   and every day   is exactly what led her to the children's defense fund years ago  it's what led her to reform struggling schools in arkansas and fight for health care as first lady  it's what has made her an outstanding senator from new york and a historic candidate for the presidency   an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary americans  and you can rest assure that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country  it will be because of her tireless work  when we finally transform our energy policy  and lift our children out of poverty  and make our economy work for working families again  it will be because she helped make it happen  i've admired her as a leader  i've learned from her as a candidate  i am proud to call her my friend  and i know how much we'll need both hillary clinton and bill clinton as a party and a country in the months and years to come  hillary and i may have started with separate goals in this campaign  but together  we shattered barriers that have stood firm since the founding of this nation  of course  we all know that one election can't erase the biases and outdated attitudes we're still wrestling to overcome  and we know there were times during this campaign when those biases emerged  but while this campaign has shown us how far we have to go  we also know that because of what hillary accomplished  my daughters and yours look at themselves a little differently today  they're dreaming a little bigger and setting their sights a little higher today  and the question we face now is  what kind of future are we going to build for them  it's a question i ask not just as a candidate for president  but as a father thinking about the challenges my girls will face as they start careers and families of their own  it's a question i ask as a son  a grandson  and a husband who's seen some of the women i love most in the world confront so many of these challenges themselves  i saw my mother  a young  single mom  put herself through school  and follow her passion for helping others while raising me and my sister  but i also saw how she struggled to provide for us  worrying at times about how she'd pay the bills  i saw my grandmother  who helped raise me  work her way up from a secretary at a bank to become one of the first women bank vice presidents in the state  but i also saw how she ultimately hit a glass ceiling   how men no more qualified than she was kept moving up the corporate ladder ahead of her  and i've see my wife  michelle  the rock of the obama family  juggle jobs and parenting with more skill and grace than anyone i know  but i've also seen how it tears at her  how sometimes  when she's with the girls  she's worrying about work   and when she's at work  she's worrying about the girls  it's a feeling i share every day   especially these days  when i'm away so much out on the campaign trail  it's something i hear all the time from working parents  especially working women   many of whom are working more than one job to make ends meet  and then there are the jobs you have once the workday ends  whether it's cleaning the house or paying the bills or buying the groceries  helping with that science project or enforcing those bedtimes  the jobs you don't get paid for  but that hold our families together  jobs that still  even in the year   far too often fall to women  but let's be clear  these issues   equal pay  work family balance  childcare   these are by no means just women's issues  when a job doesn't offer family leave  that also hurts men who want to help care for a new baby or an ailing parent  when there's no affordable childcare or afterschool programs  that hurts children who wind up in second rate care  or spending afternoons alone in front of the tv  when women still make just   cents for every dollar men make   black and latina women even less   that doesn't just hurt women  it hurts families who find themselves with less income  and have to work even harder just to get by  so you'd think solving these problems would be one of our highest national priorities  but while some politicians in washington make a lot of noise about family values  when it comes to what people actually need to support their families  and care for their families  and spend time with their families   they get awfully quiet  don't they  and year after year  it just gets harder for working parents   especially working women   to make a living while raising their kids  we take it for granted that women are the backbone of our families  but we too often ignore the fact that women are also the backbone of our middle class  and we won't truly have an economy that puts the needs of the middle class first until we ensure that when it comes to pay and benefits at work  women are treated like the equal partners they are  as the son  grandson and husband of hard working mothers  i don't accept an america that makes women choose between their kids and their careers  it's unacceptable that women are denied jobs or promotions because they've got kids at home  it's unacceptable that   million working women don't have a single paid sick day  it's unacceptable that millions of working mothers could actually be fired for taking maternity leave   and that   percent of workers who have family leave can't afford to take it because it's not paid  no matter what you do for living   i think we can all agree that raising our children and caring for our loved ones is the most important job we have  and it's time we started making that job a little bit easier  especially for working women  that means giving working parents tax credits to help with childcare and providing afterschool and summer learning programs and early childhood education to keep our kids safe and ensure they start school ready to learn  it means dramatically expanding the family and medical leave act to reach millions of people who aren't covered today   and ensuring people can take leave not just to stay home with a new baby  but also to care for elderly parents and participate in school activities like parent teacher conferences and assemblies  it means standing up for paid leave  and paid sick leave  because no one should be punished for getting sick or dealing with a family crisis  and it means fighting for equal pay for women  in   when   percent of working women in america earn half   or more than half   of their family's income  you'd think the pay gap would be a thing of the past  or that we'd at least be united in our determination to guarantee that women are paid fairly for their work  but senator mccain and i have a real difference on this issue  he thinks the supreme court got it right last year when they handed down the ledbetter decision that makes it more difficult for women to challenge pay discrimination at work  he opposed legislation that i co sponsored to reverse that decision  he suggested that the reason women don't have equal pay isn't discrimination on the job   it's because they need more education and training  well let's be clear  the problem in these kinds of cases isn't that women are somehow unqualified or unprepared for higher paying positions  the problem is that some employers aren't paying women fairly  the problem is that too many women aren't able to challenge employers who are underpaying them  and the solution is to finally close that gap and pay women what they've earned  nothing less  this isn't just an economic issue for millions of americans and their families  it's a question of who we are as a country   of whether we're going to live up to our values as a nation  and let's be clear  the supreme court's ruling on equal pay is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's at stake in this election  usually  when we talk about the court  it's in the context of reproductive rights and roe v  wade  and make no mistake about it  that's a critical issue in this election  senator mccain has made it abundantly clear that he wants to appoint justices like roberts and alito   and that he hopes to see roe overturned  well  i stand by my votes against confirming justices roberts and alito  and i've made it equally clear that i will never back down in defending a woman's right to choose  but the supreme court also affects women's lives in so many other ways   from decisions on equal pay  to workplace discrimination  to title ix  to domestic violence  to civil rights and workers' rights  and the question we face in this election is whether we'll have judges who demonstrate sound judgment and empathy  who understand how law operates in our daily lives  who are committed to upholding the values at the core of our constitution   or judges who put ideology before justice  with our fundamental rights as the first casualty  and that's just the beginning  in this election  we also face questions about the fundamental issues that will shape the world in which our sons and daughters live  we face questions about whether we'll allow the divide between main street and wall street to grow as our economy continues to struggle   or build an economy that works for all our families  where our prosperity is once again the tide that lifts every boat  whether we'll continue to spend ten billion dollars a month in iraq and leave our troops there for the next twenty years  or fifty years  or one hundred years   or start bringing them home  refocusing on al qaeda in afghanistan  rebuilding our military  and taking care of our veterans  whether we'll continue to stand by as health care costs push more people into bankruptcy and the number of uninsured keeps rising   or finally guarantee quality  affordable coverage to every single american  whether we'll watch a generation of children graduate without the skills they need to compete in a global economy   or give all our children a world class education  from early childhood all the way to college  whether we'll keep depending on dictators for our energy  giving billions in tax breaks to oil companies  and destroying our planet in the process   or decide that solving our energy crisis will be the great project of this generation  these are the choices in this election  this is what i think about when i get the chance to tuck my girls in at night  how i want my daughters   and all our daughters   to have no limits on their dreams  no obstacles to their achievement  no opportunities beyond their reach  how i want them to have opportunities their mother and grandmother never could've imagined  we've come so much closer to fulfilling that goal because of the extraordinary woman with whom i shared a stage so many times during this campaign as an opponent   and now have the privilege of doing so as a partner   my friend  senator hillary clinton  and i'm honored that all of you are joining us as we finish this journey  together  we'll turn the page on the failed policies of the past  we'll bring new energy and new ideas to meet the challenges we face  we'll ensure that our daughters have the same rights  the same dreams  the same freedom to pursue their version of happiness as our sons  and we won't just win an election   we will transform this nation  thank you "], ["obama1", "it's great to be back in virginia today and to have this opportunity to discuss some of the economic challenges women are facing  now  i come to this conversation not just as a candidate for president  but as the father of two young daughters who will one day have careers and families of their own  i come to it as a son  a grandson  and a husband who's seen the women in my own life confront so many of these challenges themselves  growing up  i saw my mother  a young single mom  put herself through school  and follow her passion for helping others while raising me and my sister  but i also saw how she struggled to provide for us  worrying sometimes about how she'd pay the bills  i saw my grandmother  who helped raise me  work her way up from a secretary at a bank to become one of the first women bank vice

actually need to support their families  and care for their families  and spend time with their families   they get awfully quiet  don't they  and year after year  it just gets harder for working parents   especially working women   to make a living while raising their kids  that's why it's time for washington to change  now  senator mccain is an honorable man  and we all deeply respect his service to our country  but when you look at our records and plans on the economic issues that matter most for women  it becomes very clear that he won't bring the change we need   while i will  that starts with acknowledging the economic difficulties so many women are facing right now  senator mccain  however  has said that we've made  great progress  on the economy  and senator phil gramm  a top economic advisor to senator mccain  just recently said that this is merely  a mental recession  senator gramm then deemed the united states   and i quote    a nation of whiners  this comes after senator mccain recently admitted that his energy proposals will have mainly  psychological  benefits  well  you know  america already has one dr  phil  when it comes to the economy  we don't need another  let's be clear  when people are struggling with the rising costs of everything from gas to groceries  when we've lost   jobs over the past six months  when typical families have seen their incomes fall nearly   since   this economic downturn isn't in our heads  it isn't whining to ask for more than just psychological relief  and i think it's time we had a president who doesn't deny our problems   or blame the american people for them   but takes responsibility and provides the leadership to solve them  that's the kind of president i will be  senator mccain and i also have a real difference on the issue of equal pay for women  in   when   percent of working women in america earn half   or more than half   of their family's income  you'd think we'd be united in our determination to close the pay gap and ensure women are paid fairly for their work  but senator mccain thinks the supreme court got it right last year when they handed down a decision making it harder for women to challenge pay discrimination at work  he opposed legislation that i co sponsored to reverse that decision  he suggested that the reason women don't have equal pay isn't discrimination on

positions  the problem is that some employers aren't paying women fairly  the problem is that too many women aren't able to challenge employers who are underpaying them  and this isn't just an economic issue for millions of americans and their families  it's a question of who we are as a country   of whether we're going to live up to our values as a nation  that's why i stood up for equal pay in the illinois state senate  and helped pass a law to give   more women protection from paycheck discrimination  that's why i've been fighting to pass legislation in the senate  so that employers don't get away with shortchanging hardworking women  and that's why i'll continue to stand up for equal pay as president  senator mccain won't   and that's a real difference in this election  as the son  grandson and husband of hard working mothers  i also don't accept an america that makes women choose between their kids and their careers  it's unacceptable that women are denied jobs or promotions because they've got kids at home  it's unacceptable that   million working women don't have a single paid sick day  it's unacceptable that millions of working mothers could actually be fired for taking maternity leave   and that   percent of workers who have family leave can't afford to take it because it's not paid  no matter what you do for living   i think we can all agree that raising our children and caring for our loved ones is the most important job we have  and it's time we started making that job a little bit easier  especially for working women  that means giving folks a hand with childcare   from expanding the childcare tax credit to an additional   million working moms  to providing afterschool and summer learning opportunities for an additional three million children  to investing   billion to give every child access to quality  affordable early childhood education  it means dramatically expanding the family and medical leave act to reach millions of additional workers   and i'll ensure that it doesn't just cover staying home with a new baby  but also lets you take leave to care for your elderly parents and participate in school activities like parent teacher conferences and assemblies  it means standing up for paid leave   so i'll invest   billion to help create paid leave systems across america   and i'll require employers to provide all their workers with at least seven paid sick days a year  senator mccain has no clear plan to expand paid leave and sick leave   and that's a real difference in this election  finally  we've got to do more to help folks at the bottom of the ladder climb into the middle class  so many working women today are living right on the edge  i met a woman a few weeks ago in new mexico who told me she works two jobs   at a restaurant and a hair salon   but the last time she saw a doctor was ten years ago  because she didn't have insurance  and couldn't afford an appointment  she later said   this is a pretty hard life  i just want to figure out how we get out of this box  when you're working that hard  life shouldn't be that hard  you shouldn't feel trapped  that's why  while senator mccain wants to continue the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans who don't need them and didn't ask for them  i'll pass a tax cut of up to   per working family  and i'll expand the earned income tax credit so that no one working fulltime winds up living in poverty  that's what i did in the state senate  bringing together democrats and republicans to provide more than   million in tax relief for struggling families across illinois  unlike senator mccain  i'll make sure the minimum wage rises each year to keep up with rising costs   it'll be   by   giving   million women a well deserved raise  unlike senator mccain  i'll work as a partner with our unions  because we know that when it comes to standing up for women's rights in the workplace  our unions are second to none   and it's time we starting giving them the support they deserve  and unlike senator mccain  i'll make sure every working woman has the chance to not just get by  but get ahead   to save  invest  build a nest egg  and provide a better life for their children  i'll cut the capital gains rate to zero to help women small business owners grow their businesses and create jobs  and for the nearly two thirds of working women who have no  k  i'll provide automatic  portable retirement savings accounts that will help them build up the wealth they need for a secure retirement  these are the real differences in this election  and my policies add up to real relief for working women  here in virginia alone    million working women will get a   tax cut    will receive child care assistance  and   women entrepreneurs won't have to pay any capital gains taxes  in the end  though  the conversation we're having isn't just about policies and plans  it's also about our most fundamental values   that when you work hard  you should be paid fairly and be able to retire with dignity  that we rise and fall together   and there are no second class citizens in our workplaces  that both work and family should be part of the american dream  as hard as it is for me to be away from my own daughters so much  that's what i think about when i have the chance to tuck them in at night  how i want my daughters   and all our daughters   to have no limits on their dreams  no obstacles to their achievement  no opportunities beyond their reach  that's why i'm running for president  and i hope all of you will join our campaign  i hope you'll help us make calls and knock on doors and sign up today to be a precinct captain and leader in this effort  i can't do it without your help  thank you "], ["obama1", "i've often said that the decisions we make in this election and in the next few years will set the course for the next generation  that is true of the wars in iraq and afghanistan  it's true of our economy  and it is especially true of our energy policy  the urgency of this challenge is clear to anyone who's tried to fill up their tank with gas that's now over   a gallon  it's clear to the legions of scientists who believe that we are nearing a point of no return when it comes to our global climate crisis  and with each passing day  it is clear that our addiction to fossil fuels is one of the most serious threats to our national security in the  st century  for the last eight years  this administration has narrowly defined security as fighting an open ended war in iraq  but in the interconnected world of this new century  new threats come from stateless terrorists  loose nuclear weapons  the spread of pandemic disease  an inability to compete with rising powers in the global economy  the threat of global climate change and our dependence on foreign oil  i'll be talking about these threats next week and in the weeks to come  and today i'd like to begin with those related to energy  we now know that the carbon emissions released by countries across the globe are warming our planet  which leads to devastating weather patterns  terrible storms  drought  and famine  in fact  studies show that by   famine could displace more than   million people worldwide  that means people competing for food and water in the next fifty years in the very places that have known horrific violence in the last fifty  africa  the middle east  and south asia  that is a threat to our security  an even more immediate and direct security threat comes from our dependence on foreign oil  the price of a barrel of oil is now one of the most dangerous weapons in the world  tyrants from caracas to tehran use it to prop up their regimes  intimidate the international community  and hold us hostage to a market that is subject to their whims  if iran decided to shut down the petroleum rich strait of hormuz tomorrow  they believe oil would skyrocket to  a barrel in minutes  a price that one speculator predicted would result in  a gallon gas    a gallon  the nearly   million a day we send to unstable or hostile nations also funds both sides of the war on terror  paying for everything from the madrassas that plant the seeds of terror in young minds to the bombs that go off in baghdad and kabul  our oil addiction even presents a target for osama bin laden  who has told al qaeda   focus your operations on oil  since this will cause  the americans  to die off on their own  if we stay on our current course  the rapid growth of nations like china and india will rise about one third by   in that same year  middle eastern regimes will be sitting on   of our global oil reserves  imagine that   the very source of energy that fuels nearly all of our transportation  controlled almost entirely by some of the world's most unstable and undemocratic governments  this is not the future i want for america  we are not a country that places our fate in the hands of dictators and tyrants   we are a nation that controls our own destiny  that's who we are  that's who we've always been  it's what led us to wage a revolution that brought down an empire  it's why we built an arsenal of democracy to defeat fascism  and stopped the spread of communism with the power of our ideals  and it's why we must end the tyranny of oil in our time  this is a debate we've been having in this campaign  but it's also an issue we've been talking about for decades  we have heard promises about energy independence from every single u s  president since richard nixon  we've heard talk about curbing our use of fossil fuels in nearly every state of the union address since the oil embargo   back then we imported about a third of our oil  today we import over half  now  a few days ago  senator mccain said   our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making  and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country  i couldn't agree more  the only problem is that out of those thirty years  senator mccain was in washington for twenty six of them  and in that time he has achieved little to help reduce our dependence on foreign oil  he's voted against raising our fuel mileage standards and joined george bush in opposing legislation twice in the last year that included tax credits for more efficient cars  he's voted against alternative sources of energy  against clean biofuels  against solar power  against wind power  against an energy bill that represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country  so when he talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis  understand that senator mccain has been a part of that failure  when he proposes policies that give   billion in tax breaks to oil companies but only pennies a day to americans struggling with high gas prices  understand that that's not part of the solution in washington  that's part of the problem in washington  when he offers a plan that doesn't make any real investment in alternative sources of energy  that represents a failure to think long term about our nation's future  that's what we've had in this country for too many years  and that's why we need change in november  i won't pretend this change will be easy or that it will come without significant cost or some measure of sacrifice from the american people  achieving energy independence is one of the greatest challenges we've ever faced  and it will be the great project of our generation  but i've seen that progress is possible  when i arrived in the u s  senate  i worked with democrats and republicans to pass a law that will give more americans the chance to fill up their cars with clean biofuels  i also passed a law that will fuel the research needed to develop a car that could get up to   miles to the gallon  and i reached across the aisle to come up with a plan to raise the mileage standards in our cars for the first time in thirty years   a plan that won support from democrats and republicans who had never supported raising fuel standards before  today  with oil and gas prices this high  we hear a lot of plans and proposals coming out of washington since politicians are finally paying attention  the problem is  they're reacting instead of acting  they're searching for easy answers to get them through the next election instead of serious  long term solutions that will offer real relief and real security for america  i understand the politics  in a country desperate for action  ideas like a gas tax holiday or expanded oil drilling in the waters off our coasts are popular  and i'll say this   if there were real evidence that these steps would actually provide real  immediate relief at the pump and advance the long term goal of energy independence  of course i'd be open to them  but so far there isn't  as good as they sound  the history of gas tax holidays is that the prices go up to fill in the gap  and the big winners end up being the retailers and oil companies   not the american people  that's what happened when we had a gas tax holiday in illinois that i supported  and that's why we ended up repealing it  it didn't work  and it would also drain the federal highway fund of billions of dollars and cost hundreds of thousands of american jobs  when it comes to offshore drilling  even senator mccain has acknowledged that it won't provide short term relief  in fact  if we started drilling today  we wouldn't see a drop of oil for seven years  and even then it would have little if any impact on prices  meanwhile  the oil companies currently have the rights to drill on   million acres of land and offshore areas that they haven't touched  i believe that before we give the oil companies any more land  it's time we tell them to start drilling on the land they already have or turn it over to someone who will  because we need that oil  we should also invest in the technology that can help us recover more oil from existing fields  and we should also look to our substantial natural gas reserves to tap a source of energy that's already powering buses and cars here and around the world  in the long term  however  we have to remember that these domestic resources are finite  even if you opened up every square inch of our land and our coasts to drilling  america still has only   of the world's oil reserves  senator mccain may believe otherwise  but that is not a real solution to our energy crisis  what we need are real ideas to give hardworking americans relief from high gas prices  and serious  long term investments to permanently reduce our dependence on foreign oil  that's exactly what my plan does  to provide immediate relief  i've proposed a second    billion stimulus package that would send energy rebate checks to every american  i've asked senator mccain to join me in passing such a plan  and i extend that invitation again today  i've also proposed a   middle class tax cut that will go to   of all workers and their families  and i'll crack down on oil speculators who may be artificially driving up the price of oil  but to truly reduce our long term dependence on foreign oil  my plan will fast track   billion of investment in a clean energy fund to help create the fuel efficient cars and alternative sources of energy that will secure this nation and jumpstart a green economy  it's a plan that will reduce our oil consumption   million barrels per day by   which is more than all the oil we're expected to import from opec nations in that same year  first  we'll double our fuel mileage standards over the next two decades utilizing much of the technology we have on the shelf today   a step that will save this country half a trillion gallons of gasoline  the equivalent of cutting the price of a gallon of gas in half  and i will provide tax credits and loan guarantees for our automakers to help them make this transition  second  we'll launch a venture capital fund that will provide   billion over five years to get the most promising clean energy technologies out of the lab and into the marketplace  a principal focus of this fund will be continuing the work i began in the senate and investing in plug in hybrid batteries that will allow cars to get up to   miles per gallon  i'm glad that senator mccain now understands the importance of this battery technology  but it will take a lot more than a cash prize to achieve this goal  it will take a serious investment  third  to create a market for alternative sources of energy like solar  wind    i'll require that   of our electricity comes renewable sources by   and that we produce two billion gallons of advanced cellulosic biofuels by   we'll also invest in finding cleaner ways to use coal  our nation's most abundant energy source  and safer ways to use nuclear power and store nuclear waste  fourth  we'll use our clean energy fund to invest over   billion a year to re tool and modernize our factories and build the advanced technology cars  trucks and suvs of the future   so that the jobs and industries of the future are created right here in the united states of america  finally  one of the fastest  easiest  and cheapest ways to conserve energy and use less oil is to make america more energy efficient and more competitive with the world  that's why  when i'm president  i will call on businesses  government  and the american people to make america   more energy efficient by   when all is said and done  my plan to invest   billion in alternative energy will create entire new industries  thousands of new businesses  and up to five million new  green jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  and we pay for all of it by taking away tax breaks for oil companies and putting a price on carbon pollution   a step that will also reduce our carbon emissions   by   most importantly  this plan will ensure that we control the energy we use with resources and technology that are available today  the steps i just spoke about are not far off  pie in the sky solutions  they are now  today  there are waiting lists for fuel efficient cars  there's an old steel mill in pennsylvania that has become the home of a new wind turbine factory  i've seen a small business in nevada powered entirely by solar power  across the planet  countries like germany and the united kingdom have already implemented clean energy polices that are reducing their carbon emissions right now  and leaders like tony blair and angela merkel have done a great job of raising the visibility of climate change within the g  now it's our turn to lead   to show that this future is possible for america  in the last century  during the days that followed the attack on pearl harbor  the american people were asked  almost overnight  to transform a peacetime economy that was still climbing out from the depths of depression into an arsenal of democracy that could wage war across three continents  many doubted whether this could be achieved in time  or even at all  president franklin roosevelt's own advisors told him that his goals for wartime production were unrealistic and impossible to meet  but the president simply waved them off  saying  believe me   the production people can do it if they really try  the challenge we face from our energy dependence is great  meeting it will take time  and it will not be easy  but if we're willing to work at it  and invest in it  and sacrifice for it  if we're willing to summon the same spirit of optimism and possibility that has defined this country's greatest progress  then i believe that we too will be able to do it if we really try  and i look forward to trying with you  thank you "], ["obama1", "hello  everybody  i'm sorry i can't join you all in person today  but thank you for letting me say a few words  first and foremost  i am honored to have your endorsement  and i appreciate the commitment you're making to help us win in november  i want to thank your president  ed mcelroy  your secretary treasurer  nat lacour  and your executive vice president  toni cortese  ed and nat  congratulations on your retirements  we are all grateful for your steady leadership and tireless efforts to guarantee our students their fundamental right to a quality education  and i look forward to working with your new officers  and i want to say hello to my friends from illinois   ed geppert  the president of the illinois federation of teachers  marilyn stewart  the president of the chicago teachers union  and aft vice president jim dougherty  and all my allies with whom i've worked so closely  over the course of this campaign  i've had the opportunity to visit schools and talk to teachers and students  paraprofessionals and support staff  college faculty and employees  public employees  nurses and health care workers all across this country  but so much of what informs my visits comes from an experience i had a few years ago at dodge elementary school in chicago  not far from where you're assembled today  i asked a young teacher there what she saw as the biggest challenge facing her students  she gave me an answer i had never heard before  she talked about what she called  these kids syndrome    the tendency to explain away the shortcomings and failures of our education system by saying  these kids can't learn  or  these kids don't want to learn  or  these kids are just too far behind  and after a while   these kids  become somebody else's problem  and she looked at me and said   when i hear that term  it drives me crazy  they're not 'these kids ' they're our kids  all of them  she's absolutely right  these children are our children  their future is our future  and it's time we understood that their education is our responsibility  i am running for president to guarantee that all of our children have the best possible chance in life  and i am tired of hearing you blamed for our problems  i want to lead a new era of mutual responsibility in education  where we all come together  parents and educators  the aft and leaders in washington  citizens all across america  united for the sake of our children's success  bringing about that future begins with fixing the broken promises of no child left behind  now  i believe that the goals of this law   educating every child with an excellent teacher  closing the achievement gap  ensuring more accountability and higher standards   were right  but promising all this while leaving the resources behind is wrong  labeling a school and its students as failures one day and then abandoning them the next is wrong  we must fix the failures of no child left behind by providing the funding that was promised  giving states the resources they need  and finally meeting our commitment to special education  but that alone is not an education policy  it's just a starting point  now  john mccain is an honorable man and i respect his service to our country  but he won't even get us to that starting point  for someone who's been in washington nearly   years  he's got a pretty slim record on education  and when he has taken a stand  it's been the wrong one  he voted against increased funding for no child left behind to preserve billions in tax breaks for the wealthiest americans   tax breaks he wants to extend without saying how he'd pay for them  he voted against increasing funds for head start  and pell grants  and the hiring of   new teachers again and again and again  in fact  his only proposal seems to be recycling tired rhetoric about vouchers and school choice  now  i've been a proponent of public school choice throughout my career  i applaud aft for your leadership in representing charter school teachers and support staff all across this country  and for even operating your own charters in new york  because we know well designed public charter schools have a lot to offer  and i've actually helped pass legislation to expand them  but what i do oppose is using public money for private school vouchers  we need to focus on fixing and improving our public schools  not throwing our hands up and walking away from them  real change is finally giving our kids everything they need to have a fighting chance in today's world  that begins with recognizing that the single most important factor in determining a child's achievement is not the color of their skin or where they come from  it's not who their parents are or how much money they have  it's who their teacher is  it's the paraprofessionals and support staff and all of you in this room  it's those who spend their own money on books and supplies  come early and stay late comparing lesson plans  who devote their lives to our next generation and serve as role models for the children who need one most because you believe that's what makes the extra difference  and it does  after all  i have two daughters  i know what their teachers mean to them  so it's time to start treating our teachers properly  that means residency programs that supply exceptional recruits to high need schools  that means mentoring programs that pair experienced  successful teachers with new ones  that means service scholarships that say if you commit your life to teaching  america will commit to paying for your college education  and when our educators succeed  i won't just talk about how great they are  i will reward them for it  under my plan  districts will be able to give teachers who mentor  or teach in underserved areas  or take on added responsibilities  or learn new skills to serve students better  or consistently excel in the classroom  the salary increase they deserve  and whether it's the plans aft helped create in cincinnati or chicago  you've shown that it is possible to find new ways to increase teacher pay that are developed with teachers  not imposed on them  and together  we will begin changing the odds for our at risk children by providing quality  affordable early childhood education for all our children  to address the achievement gap  we'll expand afterschool and summer learning opportunities  to address the dropout crisis that condemns so many futures  we'll intervene much earlier in a child's education   because the forces that lead a high school student to drop out start well before the ninth grade  but there is no program and no policy that can substitute for a parent who is involved in their child's education from day one  who makes sure that child is in school on time  helps them with their homework  and attends those parent teacher conferences  who is willing to turn off the tv once in awhile  put away the video games  and read to their child  responsibility for our children's education starts at home  we have to set high standards for them  and spend time with them  and love them  we have to hold ourselves accountable  this is the commitment we must make to our kids  this is the chance they must have  we all know there are too many young men and women in america right now who are slipping away from us as we speak   students who've lost all hope that they can make something of their lives  you know these kids  and i know these kids  i began my career over two decades ago in communities on chicago's south side  and i worked with parents and teachers and local leaders to fight for their future  we set up after school programs and protested outside government offices so that we could get those who had dropped out into alternative schools  and in time  we changed the odds for our children  but while i know hopelessness  i also know hope  in may  i visited a high school in colorado where just three years ago  only half of the seniors were accepted to college  but thanks to the hard work of caring parents  innovative educators  and some very committed students  all forty four seniors of this year's class were accepted to more than seventy colleges and universities across the country  and the example they set trickles down  while there  i met an eighth grader named theo rodriguez  who now sets his sights a little higher   he wants to go to oxford and study criminology  that's what hope is  that's the promise of education in america   that no matter what we look like or where we come from or who our parents are  each of us should have the opportunity to fulfill our god given potential  each of us should have the chance to achieve the american dream  that's why i'm running for president  aft  to make sure all our kids have that chance  but i need your help to get there  from your earliest days in chicago  you've stood up for change   when minorities weren't allowed full union membership  when parents fought to integrate our schools  when it was time to take the march for civil rights to washington  you stood up  and if you stand up with me these next four months  if you march with me and knock on doors and make phone calls and register voters  and talk to your friends and co workers and neighbors  then i promise you this  we will win this election  we will change education in this country  and we will bring about a better future for our children and for this country we love  thank you "], ["obama1", "it is always humbling to speak before the naacp  it is a powerful reminder of the debt we all owe to those who marched for us and fought for us and stood up on our behalf  of the sacrifices that were made for us by those we never knew  and of the giants whose shoulders i stand on here today  they are the men and women we read about in history books and hear about in church  whose lives we honor with schools  and boulevards  and federal holidays that bear their names  but what i want to remind you tonight   on youth night   is that these giants  these icons of america's past  were not much older than many of you when they took up freedom's cause and made their mark on history  dr  martin luther king jr  was but a  year old pastor when he led a bus boycott in montgomery that mobilized a movement  john lewis was but a  year old activist when he faced down billy clubs on the bridge in selma and helped arouse the conscience of our nation  diane nash was even younger when she helped found sncc and led freedom rides down south  and your chairman julian bond was but a  year old state legislator when he put his own shoulder to the wheel of history  it is because of them  and all those whose names never made it into the history books   those men and women  young and old  black  brown and white  clear eyed and straight backed  who refused to settle for the world as it is  who had the courage to remake the world as it should be   that i stand before you tonight as the democratic nominee for president of the united states of america  and if i have the privilege of serving as your next president  i will stand up for you the same way that earlier generations of americans stood up for me   by fighting to ensure that every single one of us has the chance to make it if we try  that means removing the barriers of prejudice and misunderstanding that still exist in america  it means fighting to eliminate discrimination from every corner of our country  it means changing hearts  and changing minds  and making sure that every american is treated equally under the law  but social justice is not enough  as dr  king once said   the inseparable twin of racial justice is economic justice  that's why dr  king went to memphis in his final days to stand with striking sanitation workers  that's why the march that roy wilkins helped lead forty five years ago this summer wasn't just named the march on washington  and it wasn't just named the march on washington for freedom  it was named the march on washington for jobs and freedom  what dr  king and roy wilkins understood is that it matters little if you have the right to sit at the front of the bus if you can't afford the bus fare  it matters little if you have the right to sit at the lunch counter if you can't afford the lunch  what they understood is that so long as americans are denied the decent wages  and good benefits  and fair treatment they deserve  the dream for which so many gave so much will remain out of reach  that to live up to our founding promise of equality for all  we have to make sure that opportunity is open to all americans  that is what i've been fighting to do throughout my over   years in public service  that's why i've fought in the senate to end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create good jobs here in america  that's why i brought democrats and republicans together in illinois to put   million in tax cuts into the pockets of hardworking families  to expand health care to   children and parents  and to end the outrage of black women making just   cents for every dollar that many of their male coworkers make  and that's why i moved to chicago after college  as some of you know  i turned down more lucrative jobs because i was inspired by the civil rights movement and i wanted to do my part in the ongoing battle for opportunity in this country  so i went to work for a group of churches to help turn around neighborhoods that were devastated when the local steel plants closed  and i reached out to community leaders   black  brown  and white   and together  we gave job training to the jobless  set up afterschool programs to help keep kids off the streets  and block by block  we helped turn those neighborhoods around  so i've been working my entire adult life to help build an america where social justice is being served and economic justice is being served  an america where we all have an equal chance to make it if we try  that's the america i believe in  that's the america you've been fighting for over the past   years  and that's the america we have to keep marching towards today  our work is not over  when so many of our nation's schools are failing  especially those in our poorest rural and urban communities  denying millions of young americans the chance to fulfill their potential and live out their dreams  we have more work to do  when ceos are making more in ten minutes than the average worker earns in a year  and millions of families lose their homes due to unscrupulous lending  checked neither by a sense of corporate ethics or a vigilant government  when the dream of entering the middle class and staying there is fading for young people in our community  we have more work to do  when any human being is denied a life of dignity and respect  no matter whether they live in anacostia or appalachia or a village in africa  when people are trapped in extreme poverty we know how to curb or suffering from diseases we know how to prevent  when they're going without the medicines that they so desperately need   we have more work to do  that's what this election is all about  it's about the responsibilities we all share for the future we hold in common  it's about each and every one of us doing our part to build that more perfect union  it's about the responsibilities that corporate america has   responsibilities that start with ending a culture on wall street that says what's good for me is good enough  that puts their bottom line ahead of what's right for america  because what we've learned in such a dramatic way in recent months is that pain in our economy trickles up  that wall street can't thrive so long as main street is struggling  and that america is better off when the well being of american business and the american people are aligned  our ceos have to recognize that they have a responsibility not just to grow their profit margins  but to be fair to their workers  and honest to their shareholders and to help strengthen our economy as a whole  that's how we'll ensure that economic justice is being served  and that's what this election is about  it's about the responsibilities that washington has   responsibilities that start with restoring fairness to our economy by making sure that the playing field isn't tilted to benefit the special interests at the expense of ordinary americans  and that we're rewarding not just wealth  but the work and workers who create it  that's why i'll offer a middle class tax cut so we can lift up hardworking families  and give relief to struggling homeowners so we can end our housing crisis  and provide training to young people to work the green jobs of the future  and invest in our infrastructure so we can create millions of new jobs  and that's why i'll end the outrage of one in five african americans going without the health care they deserve  we'll guarantee health care for anyone who needs it  make it affordable for anyone who wants it  and ensure that the quality of your health care does not depend on the color of your skin  and we're not going to do it   years from now or   years from now  we're going to do it by the end of my first term as president of the united states of america  and here's what else we'll do   we'll make sure that every child in this country gets a world class education from the day they're born until the day they graduate from college  now  i understand that senator mccain is going to be coming here in a couple of days and talking about education  and i'm glad to hear it  but the fact is  what he's offering amounts to little more than the same tired rhetoric about vouchers  well  i believe we need to move beyond the same debate we've been having for the past   years when we haven't gotten anything done  we need to fix and improve our public schools  not throw our hands up and walk away from them  we need to uphold the ideal of public education  but we also need reform  that's why i've introduced a comprehensive strategy to recruit an army of new quality teachers to our communities   and to pay them more and give them more support  and we'll invest in early childhood education programs so that our kids don't begin the race of life behind the starting line and offer a   tax credit to make college affordable for anyone who wants to go  because as the naacp knows better than anyone  the fight for social justice and economic justice begins in the classroom  but it doesn't end there  we have to fight for all those young men standing on street corners with little hope for the future besides ending up in jail  we have to break the cycle of poverty and violence that's gripping too many neighborhoods in this country  that's why i'll expand the earned income tax credit   because it's one of the most successful anti poverty measures we have  that's why i'll end the bush policy of taking cops off the streets at the moment they're needed most   because we need to give local law enforcement the support they need  that's why we'll provide job training for ex offenders   because we need to make sure they don't return to a life of crime  and that's why i'll build on the success of the harlem children's zone in new york and launch an all hands on deck effort to end poverty in this country   because that's how we'll put the dream that dr  king and roy wilkins fought for within reach for the next generation of children  and if people tell you that we cannot afford to invest in education or health care or fighting poverty  you just remind them that we are spending   billion a month in iraq  and if we can spend that much money in iraq  we can spend some of that money right here in cincinnati  ohio and in big cities and small towns in every corner of this country  so yes  we have to demand more responsibility from washington  and yes we have to demand more responsibility from wall street  but we also have to demand more from ourselves  now  i know some say i've been too tough on folks about this responsibility stuff  but i'm not going to stop talking about it  because i believe that in the end  it doesn't matter how much money we invest in our communities  or how many  point plans we propose  or how many government programs we launch   none of it will make any difference if we don't seize more responsibility in our own lives  that's how we'll truly honor those who came before us  because i know that thurgood marshall did not argue brown versus board of education so that some of us could stop doing our jobs as parents  and i know that nine little children did not walk through a schoolhouse door in little rock so that we could stand by and let our children drop out of school and turn to gangs for the support they are not getting elsewhere  that's not the freedom they fought so hard to achieve  that's not the america they gave so much to build  that's not the dream they had for our children  that's why if we're serious about reclaiming that dream  we have to do more in our own lives  our own families  and our own communities  that starts with providing the guidance our children need  turning off the tv  and putting away the video games  attending those parent teacher conferences  helping our children with their homework  and setting a good example  it starts with teaching our daughters to never allow images on television to tell them what they are worth  and teaching our sons to treat women with respect  and to realize that responsibility does not end at conception  that what makes them men is not the ability to have a child but the courage to raise one  it starts by being good neighbors and good citizens who are willing to volunteer in our communities   and to help our synagogues and churches and community centers feed the hungry and care for the elderly  we all have to do our part to lift up this country  that's where change begins  and that  after all  is the true genius of america   not that america is  but that america will be  not that we are perfect  but that we can make ourselves more perfect  that brick by brick  calloused hand by calloused hand  people who love this country can change it  and that's our most enduring responsibility   the responsibility to future generations  we have to change this country for them  we have to leave them a planet that's cleaner  a nation that's safer  and a world that's more equal and more just  so i'm grateful to you for all you've done for this campaign  but we've got work to do and we cannot rest  and i know that if you put your shoulders to the wheel of history and take up the cause of perfecting our union just as earlier generations of americans did before you  if you take up the fight for opportunity and equality and prosperity for all  if you march with me and fight with me  and get your friends registered to vote  and if you stand with me this fall   then not only will we help close the responsibility deficit in this country  and not only will we help achieve social justice and economic justice for all  but i will come back here next year on the  th anniversary of the naacp  and i will stand before you as the president of the united states of america  and at that moment  you and i will truly know that a new day has come in this country we love  thank you "], ["obama1", "sixty one years ago  george marshall announced the plan that would come to bear his name  much of europe lay in ruins  the united states faced a powerful and ideological enemy intent on world domination  this menace was magnified by the recently discovered capability to destroy life on an unimaginable scale  the soviet union didn't yet have an atomic bomb  but before long it would  the challenge facing the greatest generation of americans   the generation that had vanquished fascism on the battlefield   was how to contain this threat while extending freedom's frontiers  leaders like truman and acheson  kennan and marshall  knew that there was no single decisive blow that could be struck for freedom  we needed a new overarching strategy to meet the challenges of a new and dangerous world  such a strategy would join overwhelming military strength with sound judgment  it would shape events not just through military force  but through the force of our ideas  through economic power  intelligence and diplomacy  it would support strong allies that freely shared our ideals of liberty and democracy  open markets and the rule of law  it would foster new international institutions like the united nations  nato  and the world bank  and focus on every corner of the globe  it was a strategy that saw clearly the world's dangers  while seizing its promise  as a general  marshall had spent years helping fdr wage war  but the marshall plan   which was just one part of this strategy   helped rebuild not just allies  but also the nation that marshall had plotted to defeat  in the speech announcing his plan  he concluded not with tough talk or definitive declarations   but rather with questions and a call for perspective   the whole world of the future  marshall said   hangs on a proper judgment  to make that judgment  he asked the american people to examine distant events that directly affected their security and prosperity  he closed by asking   what is needed  what can best be done  what must be done  what is needed  what can best be done  what must be done  today's dangers are different  though no less grave  the power to destroy life on a catastrophic scale now risks falling into the hands of terrorists  the future of our security   and our planet   is held hostage to our dependence on foreign oil and gas  from the cave spotted mountains of northwest pakistan  to the centrifuges spinning beneath iranian soil  we know that the american people cannot be protected by oceans or the sheer might of our military alone  the attacks of september   brought this new reality into a terrible and ominous focus  on that bright and beautiful day  the world of peace and prosperity that was the legacy of our cold war victory seemed to suddenly vanish under rubble  and twisted steel  and clouds of smoke  but the depth of this tragedy also drew out the decency and determination of our nation  at blood banks and vigils  in schools and in the united states congress  americans were united   more united  even  than we were at the dawn of the cold war  the world  too  was united against the perpetrators of this evil act  as old allies  new friends  and even long time adversaries stood by our side  it was time   once again   for america's might and moral suasion to be harnessed  it was time to once again shape a new security strategy for an ever changing world  imagine  for a moment  what we could have done in those days  and months  and years after   we could have deployed the full force of american power to hunt down and destroy osama bin laden  al qaeda  the taliban  and all of the terrorists responsible for   while supporting real security in afghanistan  we could have secured loose nuclear materials around the world  and updated a  th century non proliferation framework to meet the challenges of the  st  we could have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in alternative sources of energy to grow our economy  save our planet  and end the tyranny of oil  we could have strengthened old alliances  formed new partnerships  and renewed international institutions to advance peace and prosperity  we could have called on a new generation to step into the strong currents of history  and to serve their country as troops and teachers  peace corps volunteers and police officers  we could have secured our homeland   investing in sophisticated new protection for our ports  our trains and our power plants  we could have rebuilt our roads and bridges  laid down new rail and broadband and electricity systems  and made college affordable for every american to strengthen our ability to compete  we could have done that  instead  we have lost thousands of american lives  spent nearly a trillion dollars  alienated allies and neglected emerging threats   all in the cause of fighting a war for well over five years in a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the   attacks  our men and women in uniform have accomplished every mission we have given them  what's missing in our debate about iraq   what has been missing since before the war began   is a discussion of the strategic consequences of iraq and its dominance of our foreign policy  this war distracts us from every threat that we face and so many opportunities we could seize  this war diminishes our security  our standing in the world  our military  our economy  and the resources that we need to confront the challenges of the  st century  by any measure  our single minded and open ended focus on iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping america safe  i am running for president of the united states to lead this country in a new direction   to seize this moment's promise  instead of being distracted from the most pressing threats that we face  i want to overcome them  instead of pushing the entire burden of our foreign policy on to the brave men and women of our military  i want to use all elements of american power to keep us safe  and prosperous  and free  instead of alienating ourselves from the world  i want america   once again   to lead  as president  i will pursue a tough  smart and principled national security strategy   one that recognizes that we have interests not just in baghdad  but in kandahar and karachi  in tokyo and london  in beijing and berlin  i will focus this strategy on five goals essential to making america safer  ending the war in iraq responsibly  finishing the fight against al qaeda and the taliban  securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue states  achieving true energy security  and rebuilding our alliances to meet the challenges of the  st century  my opponent in this campaign has served this country with honor  and we all respect his sacrifice  we both want to do what we think is best to defend the american people  but we've made different judgments  and would lead in very different directions  that starts with iraq  i opposed going to war in iraq  senator mccain was one of washington's biggest supporters for war  i warned that the invasion of a country posing no imminent threat would fan the flames of extremism  and distract us from the fight against al qaeda and the taliban  senator mccain claimed that we would be greeted as liberators  and that democracy would spread across the middle east  those were the judgments we made on the most important strategic question since the end of the cold war  now  all of us recognize that we must do more than look back   we must make a judgment about how to move forward  what is needed  what can best be done  what must be done  senator mccain wants to talk of our tactics in iraq  i want to focus on a new strategy for iraq and the wider world  it has been   months since president bush announced the surge  as i have said many times  our troops have performed brilliantly in lowering the level of violence  general petraeus has used new tactics to protect the iraqi population  we have talked directly to sunni tribes that used to be hostile to america  and supported their fight against al qaeda  shiite militias have generally respected a cease fire  those are the facts  and all americans welcome them  for weeks  now  senator mccain has argued that the gains of the surge mean that i should change my commitment to end the war  but this argument misconstrues what is necessary to succeed in iraq  and stubbornly ignores the facts of the broader strategic picture that we face  in the   months since the surge began  the strain on our military has increased  our troops and their families have borne an enormous burden  and american taxpayers have spent another   billion in iraq  that's over   billion each month  that is a consequence of our current strategy  in the   months since the surge began  the situation in afghanistan has deteriorated  june was our highest casualty month of the war  the taliban has been on the offensive  even launching a brazen attack on one of our bases  al qaeda has a growing sanctuary in pakistan  that is a consequence of our current strategy  in the   months since the surge began  as i warned at the outset   iraq's leaders have not made the political progress that was the purpose of the surge  they have not invested tens of billions of dollars in oil revenues to rebuild their country  they have not resolved their differences or shaped a new political compact  that's why i strongly stand by my plan to end this war  now  prime minister maliki's call for a timetable for the removal of u s  forces presents a real opportunity  it comes at a time when the american general in charge of training iraq's security forces has testified that iraq's army and police will be ready to assume responsibility for iraq's security in   now is the time for a responsible redeployment of our combat troops that pushes iraq's leaders toward a political solution  rebuilds our military  and refocuses on afghanistan and our broader security interests  george bush and john mccain don't have a strategy for success in iraq   they have a strategy for staying in iraq  they said we couldn't leave when violence was up  they say we can't leave when violence is down  they refuse to press the iraqis to make tough choices  and they label any timetable to redeploy our troops  surrender  even though we would be turning iraq over to a sovereign iraqi government   not to a terrorist enemy  theirs is an endless focus on tactics inside iraq  with no consideration of our strategy to face threats beyond iraq's borders  at some point  a judgment must be made  iraq is not going to be a perfect place  and we don't have unlimited resources to try to make it one  we are not going to kill every al qaeda sympathizer  eliminate every trace of iranian influence  or stand up a flawless democracy before we leave   general petraeus and ambassador crocker acknowledged this to me when they testified last april  that is why the accusation of surrender is false rhetoric used to justify a failed policy  in fact  true success in iraq   victory in iraq   will not take place in a surrender ceremony where an enemy lays down their arms  true success will take place when we leave iraq to a government that is taking responsibility for its future   a government that prevents sectarian conflict  and ensures that the al qaeda threat which has been beaten back by our troops does not reemerge  that is an achievable goal if we pursue a comprehensive plan to press the iraqis stand up  to achieve that success  i will give our military a new mission on my first day in office  ending this war  let me be clear  we must be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in  we can safely redeploy our combat brigades at a pace that would remove them in   months  that would be the summer of     one year after iraqi security forces will be prepared to stand up  two years from now  and more than seven years after the war began  after this redeployment  we'll keep a residual force to perform specific missions in iraq  targeting any remnants of al qaeda  protecting our service members and diplomats  and training and supporting iraq's security forces  so long as the iraqis make political progress  we will make tactical adjustments as we implement this strategy   that is what any responsible commander in chief must do  as i have consistently said  i will consult with commanders on the ground and the iraqi government  we will redeploy from secure areas first and volatile areas later  we will commit   billion to a meaningful international effort to support the more than   million displaced iraqis  we will forge a new coalition to support iraq's future   one that includes all of iraq's neighbors  and also the united nations  the world bank  and the european union   because we all have a stake in stability  and we will make it clear that the united states seeks no permanent bases in iraq  this is the future that iraqis want  this is the future that the american people want  and this is what our common interests demand  both america and iraq will be more secure when the terrorist in anbar is taken out by the iraqi army  and the criminal in baghdad fears iraqi police  not just coalition forces  both america and iraq will succeed when every arab government has an embassy open in baghdad  and the child in basra benefits from services provided by iraqi dinars  not american tax dollars  and this is the future we need for our military  we cannot tolerate this strain on our forces to fight a war that hasn't made us safer  i will restore our strength by ending this war  completing the increase of our ground forces by   soldiers and   marines  and investing in the capabilities we need to defeat conventional foes and meet the unconventional challenges of our time  so let's be clear  senator mccain would have our troops continue to fight tour after tour of duty  and our taxpayers keep spending   billion a month indefinitely  i want iraqis to take responsibility for their own future  and to reach the political accommodation necessary for long term stability  that's victory  that's success  that's what's best for iraq  that's what's best for america  and that's why i will end this war as president  in fact   as should have been apparent to president bush and senator mccain   the central front in the war on terror is not iraq  and it never was  that's why the second goal of my new strategy will be taking the fight to al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan  it is unacceptable that almost seven years after nearly   americans were killed on our soil  the terrorists who attacked us on   are still at large  osama bin laden and ayman al zawahari are recording messages to their followers and plotting more terror  the taliban controls parts of afghanistan  al qaeda has an expanding base in pakistan that is probably no farther from their old afghan sanctuary than a train ride from washington to philadelphia  if another attack on our homeland comes  it will likely come from the same region where   was planned  and yet today  we have five times more troops in iraq than afghanistan  senator mccain said   just months ago   that  afghanistan is not in trouble because of our diversion to iraq  i could not disagree more  our troops and our nato allies are performing heroically in afghanistan  but i have argued for years that we lack the resources to finish the job because of our commitment to iraq  that's what the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said earlier this month  and that's why  as president  i will make the fight against al qaeda and the taliban the top priority that it should be  this is a war that we have to win  i will send at least two additional combat brigades to afghanistan  and use this commitment to seek greater contributions   with fewer restrictions   from nato allies  i will focus on training afghan security forces and supporting an afghan judiciary  with more resources and incentives for american officers who perform these missions  just as we succeeded in the cold war by supporting allies who could sustain their own security  we must realize that the  st century's frontlines are not only on the field of battle   they are found in the training exercise near kabul  in the police station in kandahar  and in the rule of law in herat  moreover  lasting security will only come if we heed marshall's lesson  and help afghans grow their economy from the bottom up  that's why i've proposed an additional   billion in non military assistance each year  with meaningful safeguards to prevent corruption and to make sure investments are made   not just in kabul   but out in afghanistan's provinces  as a part of this program  we'll invest in alternative livelihoods to poppy growing for afghan farmers  just as we crack down on heroin trafficking  we cannot lose afghanistan to a future of narco terrorism  the afghan people must know that our commitment to their future is enduring  because the security of afghanistan and the united states is shared  the greatest threat to that security lies in the tribal regions of pakistan  where terrorists train and insurgents strike into afghanistan  we cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary  and as president  i won't  we need a stronger and sustained partnership between afghanistan  pakistan and nato to secure the border  to take out terrorist camps  and to crack down on cross border insurgents  we need more troops  more helicopters  more satellites  more predator drones in the afghan border region  and we must make it clear that if pakistan cannot or will not act  we will take out high level terrorist targets like bin laden if we have them in our sights  make no mistake  we can't succeed in afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our pakistan policy  we must expect more of the pakistani government  but we must offer more than a blank check to a general who has lost the confidence of his people  it's time to strengthen stability by standing up for the aspirations of the pakistani people  that's why i'm cosponsoring a bill with joe biden and richard lugar to triple non military aid to the pakistani people and to sustain it for a decade  while ensuring that the military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the taliban and al qaeda  we must move beyond a purely military alliance built on convenience  or face mounting popular opposition in a nuclear armed nation at the nexus of terror and radical islam  only a strong pakistani democracy can help us move toward my third goal   securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue states  one of the terrible ironies of the iraq war is that president bush used the threat of nuclear terrorism to invade a country that had no active nuclear program  but the fact that the president misled us into a misguided war doesn't diminish the threat of a terrorist with a weapon of mass destruction   in fact  it has only increased it  in those years after world war ii  we worried about the deadly atom falling into the hands of the kremlin  now  we worry about   tons of highly enriched uranium   some of it poorly secured   at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries  now  we worry about the breakdown of a non proliferation framework that was designed for the bipolar world of the cold war  now  we worry   most of all   about a rogue state or nuclear scientist transferring the world's deadliest weapons to the world's most dangerous people  terrorists who won't think twice about killing themselves and hundreds of thousands in tel aviv or moscow  in london or new york  we cannot wait any longer to protect the american people  i've made this a priority in the senate  where i worked with republican senator dick lugar to pass a law accelerating our pursuit of loose nuclear materials  i'll lead a global effort to secure all loose nuclear materials around the world during my first term as president  and i'll develop new defenses to protect against the  st century threat of biological weapons and cyber terrorism   threats that i'll discuss in more detail tomorrow  beyond taking these immediate  urgent steps  it's time to send a clear message  america seeks a world with no nuclear weapons  as long as nuclear weapons exist  we must retain a strong deterrent  but instead of threatening to kick them out of the g  we need to work with russia to take u s  and russian ballistic missiles off hair trigger alert  to dramatically reduce the stockpiles of our nuclear weapons and material  to seek a global ban on the production of fissile material for weapons  and to expand the u s russian ban on intermediate range missiles so that the agreement is global  by keeping our commitment under the nuclear non proliferation treaty  we'll be in a better position to press nations like north korea and iran to keep theirs  in particular  it will give us more credibility and leverage in dealing with iran  we cannot tolerate nuclear weapons in the hands of nations that support terror  preventing iran from developing nuclear weapons is a vital national security interest of the united states  no tool of statecraft should be taken off the table  but senator mccain would continue a failed policy that has seen iran strengthen its position  advance its nuclear program  and stockpile   kilos of low enriched uranium  i will use all elements of american power to pressure the iranian regime  starting with aggressive  principled and direct diplomacy   diplomacy backed with strong sanctions and without preconditions  there will be careful preparation  i commend the work of our european allies on this important matter  and we should be full partners in that effort  ultimately the measure of any effort is whether it leads to a change in iranian behavior  that's why we must pursue these tough negotiations in full coordination with our allies  bringing to bear our full influence   including  if it will advance our interests  my meeting with the appropriate iranian leader at a time and place of my choosing  we will pursue this diplomacy with no illusions about the iranian regime  instead  we will present a clear choice  if you abandon your nuclear program  support for terror  and threats to israel  there will be meaningful incentives  if you refuse  then we will ratchet up the pressure  with stronger unilateral sanctions  stronger multilateral sanctions in the security council  and sustained action outside the un to isolate the iranian regime  that's the diplomacy we need  and the iranians should negotiate now  by waiting  they will only face mounting pressure  the surest way to increase our leverage against iran in the long run is to stop bankrolling its ambitions  that will depend on achieving my fourth goal  ending the tyranny of oil in our time  one of the most dangerous weapons in the world today is the price of oil  we ship nearly   million a day to unstable or hostile nations for their oil  it pays for terrorist bombs going off from baghdad to beirut  it funds petro diplomacy in caracas and radical madrasas from karachi to khartoum  it takes leverage away from america and shifts it to dictators  this immediate danger is eclipsed only by the long term threat from climate change  which will lead to devastating weather patterns  terrible storms  drought  and famine  that means people competing for food and water in the next fifty years in the very places that have known horrific violence in the last fifty  africa  the middle east  and south asia  most disastrously  that could mean destructive storms on our shores  and the disappearance of our coastline  this is not just an economic issue or an environmental concern   this is a national security crisis  for the sake of our security   and for every american family that is paying the price at the pump   we must end this dependence on foreign oil  and as president  that's exactly what i'll do  small steps and political gimmickry just won't do  i'll invest   billion over the next ten years to put america on the path to true energy security  this fund will fast track investments in a new green energy business sector that will end our addiction to oil and create up to   million jobs over the next two decades  and help secure the future of our country and our planet  we'll invest in research and development of every form of alternative energy   solar  wind  and biofuels  as well as technologies that can make coal clean and nuclear power safe  and from the moment i take office  i will let it be known that the united states of america is ready to lead again  never again will we sit on the sidelines  or stand in the way of global action to tackle this global challenge  i will reach out to the leaders of the biggest carbon emitting nations and ask them to join a new global energy forum that will lay the foundation for the next generation of climate protocols  we will also build an alliance of oil importing nations and work together to reduce our demand  and to break the grip of opec on the global economy  we'll set a goal of an   reduction in global emissions by   and as we develop new forms of clean energy here at home  we will share our technology and our innovations with all the nations of the world  that is the tradition of american leadership on behalf of the global good  and that will be my fifth goal   rebuilding our alliances to meet the common challenges of the  st century  for all of our power  america is strongest when we act alongside strong partners  we faced down fascism with the greatest war time alliance the world has ever known  we stood shoulder to shoulder with our nato allies against the soviet threat  and paid a far smaller price for the first gulf war because we acted together with a broad coalition  we helped create the united nations   not to constrain america's influence  but to amplify it by advancing our values  now is the time for a new era of international cooperation  it's time for america and europe to renew our common commitment to face down the threats of the  st century just as we did the challenges of the  th  it's time to strengthen our partnerships with japan  south korea  australia and the world's largest democracy   india   to create a stable and prosperous asia  it's time to engage china on common interests like climate change  even as we continue to encourage their shift to a more open and market based society  it's time to strengthen nato by asking more of our allies  while always approaching them with the respect owed a partner  it's time to reform the united nations  so that this imperfect institution can become a more perfect forum to share burdens  strengthen our leverage  and promote our values  it's time to deepen our engagement to help resolve the arab israeli conflict  so that we help our ally israel achieve true and lasting security  while helping palestinians achieve their legitimate aspirations for statehood  and just as we renew longstanding efforts  so must we shape new ones to meet new challenges  that's why i'll create a shared security partnership program   a new alliance of nations to strengthen cooperative efforts to take down global terrorist networks  while standing up against torture and brutality  that's why we'll work with the african union to enhance its ability to keep the peace  that's why we'll build a new partnership to roll back the trafficking of drugs  and guns  and gangs in the americas  that's what we can do if we are ready to engage the world  we will have to provide meaningful resources to meet critical priorities  i know development assistance is not the most popular program  but as president  i will make the case to the american people that it can be our best investment in increasing the common security of the entire world  that was true with the marshall plan  and that must be true today  that's why i'll double our foreign assistance to   billion by   and use it to support a stable future in failing states  and sustainable growth in africa  to halve global poverty and to roll back disease  to send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says   you matter to us  your future is our future  and our moment is now  this must be the moment when we answer the call of history  for eight years  we have paid the price for a foreign policy that lectures without listening  that divides us from one another   and from the world   instead of calling us to a common purpose  that focuses on our tactics in fighting a war without end in iraq instead of forging a new strategy to face down the true threats that we face  we cannot afford four more years of a strategy that is out of balance and out of step with this defining moment  none of this will be easy  but we have faced great odds before  when general marshall first spoke about the plan that would bear his name  the rubble of berlin had not yet been built into a wall  but marshall knew that even the fiercest of adversaries could forge bonds of friendship founded in freedom  he had the confidence to know that the purpose and pragmatism of the american people could outlast any foe  today  the dangers and divisions that came with the dawn of the cold war have receded  now  the defeat of the threats of the past has been replaced by the transnational threats of today  we know what is needed  we know what can best be done  we know what must done  now it falls to us to act with the same sense of purpose and pragmatism as an earlier generation  to join with friends and partners to lead the world anew "], ["obama1", "it's great to be back in indiana with such a terrific group of experts  in a few moments  we'll open this up to a discussion  but first i'll make a few comments about some of the emerging threats that we face in the  st century  and offer some ideas about how we can face those threats  throughout our history  america has confronted constantly evolving danger  from the oppression of an empire to the lawlessness of the frontier  from the bombs that fell on pearl harbor to the threat of nuclear annihilation   americans have adapted to the threats posed by an ever changing world  for most of our history  the most significant danger to our security came from states  the physical safety of our people was protected by oceans  the national security of the united states was buttressed by our economic strength  and a powerful military that answered every call  today  the dangers extend beyond states alone to transnational security threats that respect no borders  these are threats that can arise from any part of the globe and spread anywhere  including to our own shores   dangers like pandemic disease  nuclear weapons proliferation  environmental degradation  international criminal networks  and terrorism  of course  we have long struggled against terrorism  and in the closing decades of the  th century  we tragically lost american lives on our soil and abroad  but it was hard to change a mindset that saw the extremism  the resentment  the terrorist training camps  and the killers as distant threats in the dark corners of the world  far away from the american homeland  then  one tuesday morning in   everything changed  i remember hearing the news on my car radio in downtown in chicago  a plane had hit the world trade center  by the time i got to my meeting  the second plane had hit  and we were told to evacuate  people gathered in the streets and looked up at the sky and the sears tower  we feared for our families and our country  we mourned the terrible loss suffered by our fellow citizens in those two office towers  at the pentagon  and in a simple field in pennsylvania  back at my office  i watched the images from new york  a plane vanishing into glass and steel  men and women clinging to windowsills  then letting go  tall towers crumbling to dust  it seemed all of the misery and all of the evil in the world were in that rolling black cloud  blocking out the september sun  what we saw that morning forced us to recognize that in a new world of threats  we are no longer protected by the size of oceans or solely by our military power  in a globalized world  the power to destroy can lie with individuals   not just states  the terrorists use a world of globalization to travel freely  to transfer money  to use telecommunications to carry out their plots  on   they used our open society to kill on a terrible scale  but even more terrifying was the thought that they could get their hands on the world's most deadly technology  since then  we have taken many steps to strengthen our defense  some of the most visible address the attacks   or failed attacks   that have already taken place  so after   airline security tightened and plastic knives replaced metal ones  after the so called shoe bomber  we started having our shoes screened  after a plot detected in london to ignite dangerous liquids  we started to check our gels and shampoos  the danger  though  is that we are constantly fighting the last war   responding to the threats that have come to fruition  instead of staying one step ahead of the threats of the  st century  this is what the   commission called our  failure of imagination  and  after   nowhere was this more apparent than in our invasion of iraq  instead of adjusting to the stateless threats of the  st century  we invaded and occupied a state that had no collaborative relationship with al qaeda  instead of taking aggressive steps to secure the world's most dangerous technology  we have spent almost a trillion dollars to occupy a country in the heart of the middle east that no longer had any weapons of mass destruction  it's time to update our national security strategy to stay one step ahead of the terrorists   to see clearly the emerging threats of our young century  and to take action to make the american people more safe and secure  it's time to look ahead   at the dangers of today and tomorrow rather than those of yesterday  america cannot afford another president who doesn't understand the threats that confront us now and in the future  today  we will focus on nuclear  biological  and cyber threats   three  st century threats that have been neglected for the last eight years  it's time to break out of washington's conventional thinking that has failed to keep pace with unconventional threats  in doing so  we'll better ensure the safety of the american people  while building our capacity to deal with other challenges   from public health to privacy  it starts with the gravest danger we face   nuclear terrorism  one of the terrible ironies of the iraq war is that president bush used concern over this threat to invade a country that had no nuclear weapons program  in the meantime  pakistani scientist aq khan was spreading to hostile nations the technology to produce nuclear weapons and the warheads to deliver them  but the fact that the president misled us into a misguided war doesn't diminish the threat of a terrorist with a weapon of mass destruction   in fact  it has only increased it  we used to worry about our nuclear stalemate with the soviet union  now  we worry about   tons of highly enriched uranium   some of it poorly secured   at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries around the world  now  we worry about the breakdown of a non proliferation framework that was designed for the bipolar world of the cold war  now  we worry   most of all   about a rogue state or nuclear scientist transferring the world's deadliest weapons to the world's most dangerous people  terrorists who won't think twice about killing themselves and hundreds of thousands in tel aviv or moscow  in london or new york  and yet  despite initiatives that cost billions of taxpayer dollars  we still don't have an adequate strategy for detecting nuclear and biological materials  a problem that's being discussed at hearings in congress today  we cannot wait any longer to protect the american people  i've made this a priority in the senate  where i've worked with indiana's own republican senator dick lugar to pass a law accelerating our pursuit of loose nuclear materials  and i'll lead a global effort to secure all loose nuclear materials around the world during my first term as president  but we need to do much more  it's time to send a clear message to the world  america seeks a world with no nuclear weapons  as long as nuclear weapons exist  we'll retain a strong deterrent  but we'll make the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons a central element in our nuclear policy  we'll negotiate with russia to achieve deep reductions in both our nuclear arsenals and we'll work with other nuclear powers to reduce global stockpiles dramatically  we'll seek a verifiable global ban on the production of fissile material for weapons  and we'll work with the senate to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty and then seek its earliest possible entry into force  by keeping our commitment under the nuclear non proliferation treaty  we'll be in a better position to rally international support to bring pressure to bear on nations like north korea and iran that violate it  both of these nations have a history of support for terror  both should face strong and increasing sanctions if they refuse to verifiably abandon their illicit nuclear programs  and both demand sustained  aggressive  and direct diplomatic attention from the united states  and that's what i'll provide as president  just as we must guard against the spread of nuclear terrorism  it's time for a comprehensive effort to tackle bio terror  we have still failed to solve the anthrax attacks that killed americans on our soil in   we know that al qaeda was attempting to develop biological weapons in afghanistan  and we know that the successful deployment of a biological weapon   whether it is sprayed into our cities or spread through our food supply   could kill tens of thousands of americans and deal a crushing blow to our economy  as president  i will launch an effort across our government to stay ahead of this threat  to prevent bio terrorism  we need to invest in our analysis  enhance our information sharing  and give our intelligence agencies the capacity to identify and interdict dangerous bio weapons around the world  to strengthen our efforts with friends and partners  i've proposed a shared security partnership that invests   billion over   years to forge an international intelligence and law enforcement infrastructure to take down terrorist networks  just as we step up our ability to prevent an attack  we must also bolster our capacity to protect against   and respond to   the threats that may come  when it comes to bio terror  this can mean the difference between a contained incident and a catastrophe  that's why we need to invest in new vaccines  to reduce the risk posed by those who would use disease as a weapon  that's why we must develop the technology to detect attacks and to trace them to their origin  so that we can react in a timely fashion  and to care for our citizens who are infected  we must provide our public health system across the country with the surge capacity to confront a crisis  making these changes will do more than help us tackle bioterror   it will create new jobs  support a healthier population  and improve america's capability to respond to any major disaster  and just as we'll find additional benefits to our action against bio terror  we can   and must   strengthen our cyber defenses in the  st century  every american depends   directly or indirectly   on our system of information networks  they are increasingly the backbone of our economy and our infrastructure  our national security and our personal well being  but it's no secret that terrorists could use our computer networks to deal us a crippling blow  we know that cyber espionage and common crime is already on the rise  and yet while countries like china have been quick to recognize this change  for the last eight years we have been dragging our feet  as president  i'll make cyber security the top priority that it should be in the  st century  i'll declare our cyber infrastructure a strategic asset  and appoint a national cyber advisor who will report directly to me  we'll coordinate efforts across the federal government  implement a truly national cyber security policy  and tighten standards to secure information   from the networks that power the federal government  to the networks that you use in your personal lives  to protect our national security  i'll bring together government  industry  and academia to determine the best ways to guard the infrastructure that supports our power  fortunately  right here at purdue we have one of the country's leading cyber programs  we need to prevent terrorists or spies from hacking into our national security networks  we need to build the capacity to identify  isolate  and respond to any cyber attack  and we need to develop new standards for the cyber security that protects our most important infrastructure   from electrical grids to sewage systems  from air traffic control to our markets  all of this will demand the greatest resource that america has   our people  in the cold war  we didn't defeat the soviets just because of the strength of our arms   we also did it because at the dawn of the atomic age and the onset of the space race  the smartest scientists and most innovative workforce was here in america  for the last few months  i've talked about how america's economic competitiveness depends on education  the same holds true for our security  if we're not investing in math and science education  our nation will fall behind  and if we're not educating the best and brightest scientists  engineers  and computer programmers here in the united states  we won't be able to keep america safe  that is the task that lies before us  we must never let down our guard  nor suffer another failure of imagination  it's time for sustained and aggressive action   to take the offense against new dangers abroad  while shoring up our defenses at home  as president  i will call on the excellence and expertise of men and women like the people here today  and i will speak clearly and candidly with the american people about what can be done   what must be done   to protect our country and our communities  now  i'd like to turn to an open discussion "], ["obama1", " i joined in progress i i also want to thank the department of antiquities for making this remarkable site available  before we open this up for questions  let me share some of the principle impressions that came out of our travel to afghanistan and iraq  first and foremost  we were extremely impressed by the extraordinary dedication and devotion and skill of our men and women in uniform  what they are doing is very tough work  our troops are performing brilliantly under difficult circumstances  and they are doing so with extraordinarily high morale  everywhere we went people are very proud of the work that they do  and i think it's important for those of us back home to remember that this volunteer fighting force is incredibly proud of their work and are doing it with great dedication  the same  by the way  holds true for the diplomats and the civilians who we met  in many ways  their work is just as difficult and just as important  and all of us back home have reason to be proud  we support their heroic service we went to afghanistan first because it is the central front in the war against terrorism  that is where the   attacks were planned  and today in afghanistan and the border region of pakistan al qaeda and the taliban are mounting a growing offensive against the security of the afghan people and increasingly the pakistani people while plotting to attack against the united states  the situation in afghanistan is perilous and urgent  we must act now to reverse that deteriorating situation  i called over a year ago for additional u s  troops to be placed in afghanistan as well as more non military assistance and more support from our nato allies  i'm glad that there's a growing consensus back home that we need more resources in afghanistan  we should not wait any longer to provide them in our meetings with president karzai and the other afghan leaders  i stressed my strong commitment to afghanistan's security and economic development and urged them to work on a more for more basis  more u s  and nato support for afghanistan and more action by the afghan government to take on corruption and counter narcotics  to improve the rule of law and to make sure that resources and services are actually delivered for the afghan people we also need a policy as both jack reid and chuck hagel mentioned that compels pakistani action against terrorists who threaten our common security and are using the f a t a  and the northwest territories of pakistan as a safe haven  we have to do this at the same time as we deepen our relationship with the pakistani people and the recently elected democratic government  together i believe we have to succeed in taking the fight to the terrorists in order to protect the american people as well as the afghan people  and to do that  we're going to have to support lasting stability for afghanistan and pakistan as well as economic opportunity for their people in iraq  we reviewed the gains that have been made in lowering the levels of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military  the increased capabilities of the iraq security forces  the sadr cease fire and the decision by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda  we also noted that the political reconciliation and economic development is necessary for long term stability in iraq continues to lag  there is security progress  but now we need a political solution  the message we heard from iraq's leaders is that they're ready to do more  and they want to take more responsibility for their country  i believe that the best way to support iraqi sovereignty and to encourage the iraqis to stand up is through the responsible redeployment of our combat brigades  i welcome that the growing consensus in the united states and iraq for a timeline  my view based on the advise of the military experts is that we can redeploy safely in   months so that our combat brigades are out of iraq in   as president  i intend to work with our military commanders to assure that we redeploy out of iraq carefully with the safety of our troops in mind  and as i've said over the last two years  once we redeploy our combat brigades  we're still going to retain a capability to protect our personnel  to target terrorists and to train iraqi security forces if there is political progress  in speaking with afghans and iraqis  the u s  military and civilians  we all three of us  i think  were struck by both the peril and the promise of this moment if we responsibly end the war in iraq  we can strengthen our military  step up our efforts to finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan and succeed in leaving iraq to a sovereign government that can take responsibility for its own future  in short  we can seize this moment to make america more secure  to focus on broader challenges like defeating terrorism  reversing this threat of nuclear weapons and achieving true energy security  challenges that i will discuss  among others  with some of our closest friends and allies in the days ahead finally  i'm honored to be here in jordan  which has been an invaluable ally and partner of the united states for many years  i want to thank the people of jordan for their friendship and their hospitality  jordan's leadership is a source of pride for its own people  i've long admired king abdullah's example of moderation and modernization  i look forward to discussing opportunities to deepen our cooperation on the full range of security and economic challenges that together we face in the region  i know that  as always  the king will be a valuable source of insight now  before i take some questions  i want to make a comment about the events today in jerusalem  today's bulldozer attack is a reminder of what israelis have courageously lived with on a daily basis for far too long  i strongly condemn this attack and will always support israel in confronting terrorism and pursuing lasting peace and security  right now my thoughts and prayers go out to all who were injured and to their families  with that  we'd be happy to start taking questions  and identify  if you want to pose a question to either senator hagel or senator reid    inaudible  all right  how many questions  ok  that's a bunch  so let me pick these off  first of all  it is true that some of the tribal leaders as well as the local governor in anbar expressed concern about a potential precipitous draw down of u s  troops  which is why i haven't proposed a precipitous draw down  what i've proposed is a steady  deliberate draw down over the course of   months  and i emphasized that to them  what became clear in our conversations is that there remains mistrust between sunni tribal leaders as well as government officials in the anbar region  and the central government  and so part of executing a lasting stability in iraq remains reconciling those two groups  there has been a cessation of violence and ethnic strife  but the suspicions are still there  and to some degree  the u s  forces are seen as a more honest broker in resolving those differences what i emphasize is the fact that the u s  government can't be there forever  the u s  military can't be there forever  so it's going to be important for the parties themselves  the iraqi people  to make sure that they're dealing with these underlying tensions and concerns  with respect to the military leaders  i had a terrific conversation   we had a terrific conversation with general petraeus and ambassador crocker  i've tried to emphasize repeatedly that the job they've done on the ground is extraordinary  the two of them i think are as good a team as we've seen  my thanks goes out to them for what they've accomplished the issue for general petraeus   and i want to be careful about characterizing our conversation in detail but i think his concern has to do with wanting to retain as much flexibility as possible  so the issue is not a perception that   let me put it this way  the focus of our conversation was not how precipitous my proposal was because  as he emphasized  he  too  would like to see our troops out  violence reduced  and iraqi a functioning  stable  democratic government that is keeping terrorists out and is functioning as an ally to us in the region in his role as commander on the ground  not surprisingly  he wants to retain as much flexibility as possible in terms of accomplishing that goal  and what i emphasized to him was  yes  if i were in his shoes  i'd probably feel the same way  but my job as a candidate for president and a potential commander in chief extends beyond iraq  and so what we saw in afghanistan  for example  where you've got a deteriorating security situation and all of the commanders uniformly indicated that two to three brigades would be extraordinarily helpful in allowing them to accomplish their goals  the only way we're going to get those troops over there in a meaningful way is that if we are taking them from someplace else so that's something that i have to factor in  i have to factor in the perceptions of the iraqi people and the statements by prime minister malaki and his spokespeople in public  that they are ready to see the iraqi government take on more responsibility for security  so there are range of factors that i have to take into account as a commander in chief or a potential commander in chief that i wouldn't expect general petraeus or anybody who's just on the ground to have to take into account  and  finally  with respect to the surge  we don't know what would have happened if i   if the plan that i put forward in january   to put more pressure on the iraqis to arrive at a political reconciliation  to begin a phased withdrawal  what would have happened had we pursued that strategy i am pleased that as a consequence of great effort by our troops  but also as a consequence of a shift in allegiances among the sunni tribal leaders as well as the decision of the sadr militias to stand down that we've seen a quelling of the violence  but as i emphasize a year ago  two years ago  and as i have to emphasize today  ultimately whether or not we're going to have a functioning iraq is largely going to depend on the capacity of the iraqi people to unify themselves  to get beyond some of the sectarian divisions that have plagued the country  and to start setting up a government that is working for the people  and i just want to echo something that both chuck and jack mentioned   everywhere we went  one of the biggest concerns right now is the fact that we got scores of unemployed iraqi men and women who are not getting the kind of opportunity that i think is going to be important  and given that iraq is now experiencing a huge surge in their budget because of the rising price of oil  now is a particularly important moment and opportunity for them to start getting some of that money out into the provinces  yes b question b   i off mike i b obama b  well  you know  i will leave it to the voters to make that decision  and my hope is to avoid a colloquy with the mccain campaign over the next four or five days  partly because i think when we're overseas we're trying to  we've got a bipartisan group here and my hope is that we can focus on some areas of agreement  i think that senator mccain deserves great credit for caring deeply about the safety and the security of the american people  i think he's made a series of decisions based on his best judgment of what would be good for american safety and security  i've differed with him on a range of those judgments  but i think that in each instance he's made those decisions based on what he thinks makes the most sense i can speak about my judgment and say that if you look at the where we're moving towards internationally  a need to refocus attention on afghanistan and to go after the taliban  including putting more troops on the ground  and to put more pressure on pakistan to deal with the safe havens of terrorists in their territory  when you look at the need for engagement with iran  something that i was scorned for during earlier parts of the campaign  when you look at increasing recognition that we can't stay in iraq in perpetuity and that a time frame  timetable  timeline  whatever you want to refer to  is appropriate i think that the judgments that i've made over the course of the last two years are ones that match up with the reality on the ground  and ultimately i think that's where u s  foreign policy is going to have to go  regardless of who becomes the next president  democrat or republican  i think we're all going to have to strip away the ideology  we're going to have to strip away the politics  the issues are too serious  and the reality is reasserting itself  and that means that the next president is going to have to make a series of very difficult judgments and balance a set of risks based on the best possible intelligence and information available to him but  you know  the situation is so serious that we're not going to have time for the kinds of political games or partisanship that i think has come to characterize too much of our foreign policy  yes    inaudible   i'm going to have to get a pen for all these triple questions you guys   you know  it's always a bad practice to say  always  or  never  but so let me amend it by saying that i don't have doubts about my ability to apply sound judgment to major national security problems that we face  these are difficult questions  and i don't think that anybody believes they have the perfect formula for solving some of these very difficult foreign policy problems  but i feel very confident in my world view and my ability to shape a discussion that takes arguments and facts into consideration and then come up with the best answer  second question was how would i apportion the improvements in iraq  i don't know  garrett  how to put into numerical factor on that  there is no doubt that when we put in   american troops  who are dedicated  who are brave  and who bring extraordinary skill to their jobs  that they're going to make a difference  i think the commanders on the ground themselves would acknowledge that  had you continued to see sunni leadership align themselves with aqi that we would be in a different situation right now  that if you continued to see ethnic cleansing in baghdad or the sadr militias continuing to engage in some of that activity and constant reprisals  that you'd still have some big problems there right now  but i don't know how to put a number to that and the last question was  given that we're going to have to put some resources in afghanistan  what does that say about my domestic policy  we're spending   to   billion a month in iraq  we're not coming close to that kind of spending in afghanistan  two or three additional brigades in afghanistan obviously is not going to take up the entire combat operation that exists in iraq right now  so i still believe that there are savings to be had  and i should point out that one of the things that we all discussed during our visit to iraq was the fact that their budget has now doubled because oil prices have doubled and one of the problems we have right now is getting that money out the door  part of that is a lack of capacity on the iraq government's part and so we need to provide them a lot more technical training and management capacity just to make sure that projects get done  basic electrification on a region like anbar could make an enormous difference and they've got the resources to start doing it  but some of it is also willpower and some of it is cutting through the continuing political conflict between the various factions there  and that's why it's so important that we continue to press the iraqis to move in that direction  it's also important that wherever they want to take responsibility that we encourage them  jack  yes  i'm sorry  i'm sorry  i'm just trying to get to everybody  they had a front seat  they were lucky  but we'll try to get to everybody  go ahead b question b   i off mike i b obama b  i'll take the second question first  i've been very clear on that  jake  i mean  we've been consistent on it  what i said is we'll get troops out at the pace of one to two brigades per month and that we would retain a capacity to protect our diplomatic and humanitarian operations there and our personnel  that we would retain a counter terrorism capacity to go after aqi  if it was resurgent  to deal with potential reemergence of shia militias that are trying to assert themselves in a violent fashion  to make sure that we are continuing to train iraqi security forces i have deliberately avoided providing a particular number on that because that is precisely the kind of thing where our military commanders have to tell me what they need in order to accomplish that mission  but my goal is to no longer have u s  troops engaged in combat operations in iraq  in terms   look  there are all kinds of things that i learned  i think one of the things that was most eye  opening was the extent to which the poorest border between afghanistan and pakistan makes it very difficult for our troops  as good as they are  to decisively defeat the taliban and the terrorist operations in afghanistan if we don't get a handle on that border region  we are going to continue to have problems  and al qaeda is going to and their networks are going to be able to continue project beyond that region  and so one of the things that was driven home was the importance of our diplomatic efforts in pakistan  which  by the way  may include having a conversation with india and seeing if we can lessen some of the tensions between those two countries  a lot of what drives  it appears motivations on the pakistan side of the border still has to do with their concerns and suspicions about india  and i think that's an example of aggressive  creative diplomacy  we haven't had a conversation between the indians and the pakistanis that has been sustained and meaningful  about how they can arrive at a more sensible arrangement between the two countries  that could relieve some of the pressure and help us go after some of these forces along the border regions  ok  yes  yes  sir  go ahead  yes b question b   i off mike i b obama b  yes b question b   i off mike i   b obama b  yes b question b   i off mike i b obama b  yes b question b   i off mike i b obama b  well  first of all  i just want to say that the reason that i haven't focused on the israeli palestinian issue is because i'm spending tomorrow visiting israel and the west bank  and so i was going to save some of these comments until i actually had these conversations tomorrow  it wasn't that we were avoiding the issue  we just came back from afghanistan and iraq it is my firm belief that it is in the interest of both the israeli people and the palestinians to arrive at a peaceful settlement it is a very difficult process  there is a lot of history that exists between those two people  that history is not going to vanish overnight  people's memories are long  there's been bloodshed and disputes that date back generations and so i think it's unrealistic to expect that a u s  president alone can suddenly snap his fingers and bring about peace in this region b obama b  what a u s  president can do is apply sustained energy and focus on the issues of the israelis and the palestinians  and i do believe that an ultimate resolution is going to involve two states standing side by side in peace and security  and that the israelis and the palestinians are going to both have to make compromises in order to arrive at that two state solution  now  one of the difficulties that we have right now is that in order to make those compromises you have to have strong support from your people  and the israeli government right now is unsettled  you know  the palestinians are divided between fatah and hamas  and so it's difficult for either side to make the bold move that would bring about peace the way  for example  the peace between israel and egypt was brought about  those leaders were in a much stronger position to initiate that kind of peace  so one of the things i think the united states is going to have to do is to help build capacity  make sure that israel feels secure  and obviously the tragedy that happened with the bulldozer does not help with their security  that breeds a sense of insecurity  and that's why terrorism is so counterproductive  as well as being immoral  because it makes  i believe  the israelis want to dig in and simply think about their own security regardless of what's going on beyond their borders  i think the same would be true of any people when these kinds of things happen and innocent people are injured  on the other hand  i think that the palestinians have to feel some sense of progress in terms of their economic situation  you know  whether it's on the west bank or gaza  if people continually feel pressed  where they can't get to their job or they can't make a living  they get frustrated b obama b  and it's hard for them if they see no glimmer of hope to then want to take a leap in order to make impressions  and so  i think what the united states can do is   is to help to create more   a greater sense of security among the israelis  a greater sense that economic progress and increased freedom of movement is something that can be accomplished in the palestinian territories  and with those confidence building measures  that we get discussions back on track   b question b   i off mike i   b obama b  well  you know  we've been going back and forth on this for a very long time  and i think that there's been an artificial construct that's been created where you essentially have two choices  either i am so rigid and stubborn that i ignore anything that happens during the course of the   months in which our plan is being implemented  or  alternatively  i just have an indefinite open ended commitment that is never driven by clear   a clear timetable or a set of goals  and i reject that   that those are the only two options  i think it is   what i've consistently said is that my job  should i be commander in chief  is to set a vision  a strategic vision  of what's best for u s  national security  i strongly believe that what is best for u s  national security is to initiate a phased withdrawal and to set a timeframe that is very consistent with what the iraqis are now saying and i think can be accomplished   b obama b  i've also said in the past   this is not new   that if  for example  you started seeing a resurgence of ethnic violence that was   that presented the possibility of genocide  that i would always reserve the right as commander in chief to intervene   hopefully  with the international community so facts have to affect your decision making  and  you know  over the course of   months things are going to constantly change  but that doesn't detract from the importance of setting a set of clear objectives and having a sense of where you're trying to steer the ship  and that's what we haven't had  and that's what i think is so important b question b   i off mike i b obama b  this is my hometown paper so i got to call on him go ahead  mike   b question b   i off mike i b obama b  i will call you laughter reporters are the same everywhere  aren't they go ahead b question b   i off mike i b obama b  well  let me   let me   i want to avoid being too specific in characterizing my conversations with prime minister maliki  but all three of us certainly raised the importance of the central government  including sunnis in an aggressive way  into the government   inaudible  resolving the hydrocarbon law  resolving the issue of provincial power  resolving the issues of debaathification and amnesty  and making sure that we actually implement these  inaudible because one of the things that we've been seeing   and i think ambassador crocker would acknowledge this   that oftentimes you can get laws passed or at least a draft out with much fanfare and then there's not the follow up and the execution that gives all the factions confidence that we're going to be moving forward b obama b  i do see some progress  i think that the willingness of the maliki government to go after shia militias was a confidence  building measure  i think the sunnis looked at that and said  well  it is possible that this army that is being created   which  by the way  i think has improved significantly  they're not yet capable of operating entirely independently  but are taking the lead in more and more actions on the ground  i think that was a step that gave some confidence  but more is going to have to be done  i think resolving the big issues like the hydrocarbons law in a way that gives sunnis the impression that their voice is heard  that's going to be important  now  the willingness of sunni cabinet members who have resigned to now return  to have those cabinet seats filled  and a sense that the sunnis are going to participate aggressively in the upcoming elections  that  again  is i think a sign of progress  you know  what we want to get to  i think what the iraqi people want get to  is a point where you've got disputes and arguments  but they're happening within the context of a functioning political process that ultimately leads to improvements in the lives of people  and that's where i think we should be focusing a lot of our effort  this is a good place b question b   i off mike i b obama b  i think he has gained a lot more confidence from the iraqi people as a consequence of his actions in basra and sadr  either of you guys want to comment on this   this part  because you were in these conversations b hagel b  that's all right  go ahead b obama b  ok  yes  sir  go ahead b question b   i off mike i b obama b  i'm sorry  i need you to speak up  you were speaking up very loudly when you wanted me to call on you b question b   i off mike i b obama b  well  let me   let me be absolutely clear  israel is a strong friend of israel's  it will be a strong friend of israel's under a mccain government   administration  it will be a strong friend of israel's under an obama administration  so that policy is not going to change   b obama b  what i think can change is the ability of the united states government and a united states president to be actively engaged with the peace process and to be concerned and recognize the legitimate difficulties that the palestinian people are experiencing right now  and recognize that it is not only in the interest of the palestinian people that their situation improves  i believe it's also in the interest of the israeli people  because it is going to be very difficult for israel ever to feel secure if you don't have some sense of opportunity and prosperity and stability with its   its neighbors  and so  you know  my goal is to make sure that we work  starting from the minute i'm sworn into office  to try to find some breakthroughs now  the other thing i have to make a point though is is that everybody's going to have responsibilities and obligations in this process  and sometimes i think there's a tendency for each side to focus on the faults of the other instead of looking in the mirror and saying  what can be done to improve the situation  so  for example  i think with respect to the palestinians  obviously it is very important to resolve the internal differences between the palestinians  it's going to be very difficult for the israelis to resolve a significant peace agreement if they don't know who they should be dealing with and who can actually enforce an agreement  but i just use that as one example   b question b   i off mike i b obama b  i believe that the situation in iraq is more secure than it was a year and a half ago  i believe think that the definition of success depends on how you look at it  originally  the administration suggested that the key measure was whether it gave breathing room for a political reconciliation  so far  i think we have not seen the kind of political reconciliation that's going to bring about long term stability in iraq but there's no doubt that security has improved  and there's no doubt that the extraordinary sacrifice of american men and women in uniform have contributed to that success in terms of my conversations with general petraeus  there's no doubt that general petraeus does not want a timetable  i mean  i think he said that publicly  and he is   and  as i said  in his role  i think he wants maximum flexibility to be able to do what he believes needs to be done inside of iraq but keep in mind  for example  one of general petraeus' responsibilities is not to think about how could we be using some of that   billion a month to shore up a u s  economy that is really hurting right now  if i'm president of the united states  that is part of my responsibility b obama b  general petraeus' responsibility  as commander on the ground in iraq  means that if one of his two stars or three stars says   you know  we really need to pursue this electrification project and it's going to cost x millions of dollars  and because we can't get political reconciliation right now  it's better for the u s  just to go ahead and spend its money  despite the fact that iraq has seen its budget double  general petraeus' judgment may be   you know what  it's worth it for me  in order to accomplish my tasks inside iraq  to go ahead and do that if i'm president of the united states  i've got to be thinking   how else could i be using that money  and should i be putting more pressure on the iraqis to spend some of that money themselves b question b   i off mike i b obama b  well  no  i mean  look  you know  i think  again  the notion is is that either i do exactly what my military commanders tell me to do or i'm ignoring their advice  no  i'm factoring in their advice but placing it in this broader strategic framework that   that's required  ok  thank you very much  everybody "], ["obama1", " i joined in progress i  today  mahmoud abbas and prime minister fayad  when i was in ramallah  earlier  the threats to israel security begin in sderot  but they don't end there  they include outrageous acts of terror like the attack we just saw yesterday in jerusalem  rearming hezbollah in lebanon and an iranian regime that sponsors terrorism  pursues nuclear weapons and threatens israel's existence  a nuclear iran would pose a grave threat and the world must prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon  today i had a series of productive discussions with many of israel's key leaders about how to address the broad range of security threats that israel faces and the broad threats that all of us face  i look forward to continuing these consultations with prime minister olmert this evening  and i'm also looking forward to consulting closely with our european allies about iran and other challenges in the days ahead  now let me just close by saying that i bring to sderot  an unshakeable commitment to israel's security  the state of israel faces determined enemies who seek its destruction  but it also has a friend and ally in the united states that will always stand by the people of israel  that's why i'm proud to be here today and that's why i will work from the moment that i return to america  to tell the story of sderot and to make sure that the good people who live here are enjoying a future of peace and security and hope  so with that  we're going to take questions  but i might   before everybody starts raising hands  my understanding is this gentleman right here is going to actually call on people so that i don't get in trouble with any of you  i want all of you to like me so i'm going to   he's going to be the bad guy  he's going to make the decision  we've got a limited amount of time  why don't you go ahead   b question b  senator obama  you said in opec convention that the  inaudible  jerusalem could continue to be the capital city  then you changed it and clarified later on in the    inaudible  wonder  how could you be sure if your other statesmen  that you are going to be committed to the security and safety of israel and you're not going to change it even when you're the president of the united states b obama b  first of all  i didn't change my statement  i continued to say that jerusalem will be the capital of israel  and i have said that before and i will say it again  and i also have said that it is important that we don't simply slice the city in half  but i've also said that that's a final status issue  that's an issue that has to be dealt with with the parties involved  the palestinians and the israelis  and it's not the job of the united states to dictate the form in which that will take  but rather to support the efforts that are being made right now to resolve these very difficult issues that have a long history  now  in terms of knowing my commitments  you don't have to just look at my words  you can look at my deeds  just this past week  we passed out of the u s  senate banking committee  which is my committee  a bill to call for divestment from iran  as a way of ratcheting up the pressure to ensure that they don't obtain a nuclear weapon  when israel invaded lebanon  in response to the kidnapping of israel's soldiers  i was one of the first people to state that israel had an unequivocal right to defend itself and to rescue soldiers that had been captured  and that is what any country would do  on vote after vote i have demonstrated my support of the state of israel  so  the way you know where somebody's going is where have they been  and i've been with israel for many  many years now  what is also true is i believe it is strongly in the interests of israel's security to arrive at a lasting peace with the palestinian people  i don't think those positions are contradictory  i think they're complementary  you know  it is going to be hard for israel over the long term and this is something that i think the vast majority of israelis understand  that it's going to be hard to achieve true security if there's still hostile neighbors only a few miles away  but  what i think that israel has to do is to make sure that that peace is not purchased at   by putting israel's security at risk  and it's the job of the united states i think  to make sure that that peace is centered and promotes israel's long term security b question b  senator  you told me yesterday that if you become president  you would tackle the issue of middle east peace right away  what fresh strategies would you bring and can you respond to the concerns of israelis who feel that you might pressure them to make too many concessions  and again  what new strategies would you bring   b obama b  well  i think it's   ok  why don't you ask your buddies to speak up louder when they're asking the question  i'll repeat it  the question was   what fresh strategies could be brought to the middle east peace process  and what was the second part of it  the concerns about it   israel's concerns about me pressuring them into concessions  well  look  i don't think that minister livni or minister barak or  inaudible  or the others  president perez  when they spoke to me today got any sense that i would be pressuring them to accept any kinds of concessions that would put their security at stake  we don't need a peace deal just to have a piece of paper that doesn't result in peace  we need something that's meaningful  and it's not going to be meaningful if israel's security is not part of that package  and any american president  whether it's myself or john mccain  can rest assured that israel won't be pressured into something that is going to put them at risk  because they have an obligation to their people  so  my job is to   if i'm the president  my job and my team's job is not to dictate to either of the parties what this deal should be  but hopefully to be able to facilitate and promote a meaningful  realistic  pragmatic  concrete strategy for achieving these goals  and that's why i don't want to get too specific in response to your first question because i think it's important not to predetermine in some sense what the parties are going to agree to  but rather to just set up a process in which this can occur  i can tell you one thing that is very important  though  and that is a u s  administration has to put its weight behind a process recognizing that it's not going to happen immediately  and that's why i can't   i will not wait until a few years into my term or my second term if i'm elected  in order to get the process moving  i think we have a window right now that needs to be taken advantage of  i think you've got a set of moderate palestinian leaders who are interested  i think the israeli people are interested in moving this process along  but i also think there's a population on both sides that is becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress  and where there's hopelessness and despair  that can often turn in a bad direction  and as i've noted in all the conversations i've had  israel also has this enormous threat from iran  which is connected to the situation between hamas and hezbollah and more moderate forces in the region  and so to the extent that we can solve this problem  it also helps us solve some of these larger problems that are not just questions of israel's national security  but also the united states national security   b question b  in the name of the israeli colleagues  welcome to israel b obama b  thank you b question b  you have just justified israel's alleged attack in syria  will you bear the same understanding should israel act similarly towards iran   b obama b  well  you know  my goal is to avoid the hypothetical by moving rapidly to mobilize the international community  to offer a series of big sticks and big carrots to the iranian regime to stand down on nuclear weapons  we have to do it now  i don't want it to get started  should i become president  i want the iranians to understand that they should take advantage of the shift in the bush administration's approach where they sent one of our diplomats  william burns  to the latest discussions with the european delegation  iranians need to understand that whether it's the bush administration or an obama administration  that this is a paramount concern to the united states  and  i think there are opportunities for us to mobilize a much more serious regime of sanctions on iran  but also to offer them the possibility of improved relations in the international community if they stand down on these nuclear weapons  what i have also said  though  is that i will take no options off the table in dealing with this potential iranian threat  and understand part of my reasoning here  a nuclear iran would be a game changing situation not just in the middle east  but around the world  whatever remains of our nuclear non proliferation framework  i think would begin to disintegrate  you would have countries in the middle east who would see the potential need to also obtain nuclear weapons  many of these countries  including iran  have ties to terrorist organizations  which means that suddenly you could have loose nuclear materials falling into the hands of terrorists  that is our single  most important threat both to israel but also to the united states of america  and so this is something that we're going to spend a lot of time working on   b question b  in your first year as president  with president ahmadinejad  without preconditions  is there anything you have heard today  in your discussions with israeli leaders that has made you rethink that pledge  or are you still standing by that   b obama b  dan  i think you have to take a look at what the question was in south carolina and how i responded  the question is  would i meet with leaders without preconditions in pursuit b question b   off mike b obama b  i understand  i understand b question b   off mike    in your first year as president b obama b  but i think that what i said in response was that i would  at my time and choosing  be willing to meet with any leader if i thought it would promote the national security interests of the united states of america  and  dan  that continues to be my position  that if i think that i can get a deal that is going to advance our cause  then i would consider that opportunity  but what i also said was that there is a difference between meeting without pre conditions and meeting without preparation  you know  the specific context of your question let's say with respect to iran  is a bush administration policy  for example  that said  we will not involve ourselves in any diplomatic negotiations or even talks with the iranians until they have made the decision to stand down on their nuclear weapons  well  that presumably would be the topic of negotiations  and if we take that position  then it's not surprising that we might not make much progress on that front  my whole goal in terms of having tough  serious  direct diplomacy  is not because i'm naive of the nature of any of these regimes  i'm not  it is because if we show ourselves willing to talk and to offer carrots and sticks in order to deal with these pressing problems  and if iran then rejects any overtures of that sort  it puts us in a stronger position to mobilize the international community to ratchet up the pressure on iran  our unwillingness to talk or the perception that we are trying to bully our way through negotiations  that's eliminated as an excuse for them not dealing with these issues in an appropriate way  and so you know  i think that it is very important for us to exhaust every possible avenue to solve this problem and to send the signal to the international community that this is a top priority  we are willing to extend ourselves and work hard to solve this problem  but what we're not willing to do is to permit a nuclear arms race in the middle east  ok   b question b   off mike  mr  obama  inaudible would you accept a situation like this in one of the american towns stuck in the states  inaudible  do you think israel should negotiate with hamas in gaza   b obama b  i don't think any country would find it acceptable to have missiles raining down on the heads of their citizens  the first job of any nation state is to protect its citizens  and so i can assure you that if   i don't even care if i was a politician  if somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night  i'm going to do everything in my power to stop that  and i would expect israelis to do the same thing  in terms of negotiations with hamas  it is very hard to negotiate with a group that is not representative of a nation state  does not recognize your right to exist  has consistently used terror as a weapon  and is deeply influenced by other countries  i think that hamas leadership will have to make a decision at some point as to whether it is a serious political party seeking to represent the aspirations of the palestinian people  and  as a consequence  willing to recognize israel's right to exist and renounce violence as a tool to achieve its aims  or whether it wants to continue to operate as a terrorist organization  until that point  it's hard for israel  i think  to negotiate with a country that   or with a group that doesn't recognize israel's right to exist at a country   ok thank you very much  everybody  i appreciate it "], ["obama1", " b moderators b br suzanne malveaux  cnn br romesh ratnesar  time magazine b ratnesar b  senator  it's good to see you  obama  thank you b ratnesar b  welcome home   b malveaux b  thank you  senator  thank you b obama b  thank you  hello   b malveaux b  hello  did you get much sleep   b obama b  hello  everybody   b audience b  hello b obama b  not enough sleep   laughter i'm going back to take a nap after this   laughter b malveaux b  if you'd like to start and just give us your impressions and some of the things that   the highlights you took away from your trip b obama b  well  a couple of things that i think are worth mentioning  number one  our troops are doing extraordinary work  and they do it day in  day out  we were in afghanistan  we were in iraq  many of these young men and women have been on two  three  in some cases four or five tours of duty  but morale remains high  they are proud of the work that they're doing  they're carrying out their duties with excellence and determination and so that was very encouraging  i think the violence is down in iraq  and the work of our troops has greatly contributed to consolidating some of those gains  there's no doubt that we've seen al qaida marginalized in the sunni regions in iraq  that has made a big contribution toward quelling the violence  and the shia militias have stood down  i think that president   prime minister maliki   his willingness to take more responsibility and set a time frame  or a time line  for withdrawing our troops is a very positive step  in afghanistan  though  things are worsening  and we visited there just a week or so after a raid on a u s  outpost that had resulted in nine of our soldiers being killed  and what you get a sense of is that a combination of drug trafficking in afghanistan  a government that is   an afghan government that is still not getting enough services out to the people  combined with the ability of the taliban and al qaida to engage in raids and then cross over into the pakistani held territories  so that they've got safe havens there that u s  troops can't follow   that is a huge problem  we're going to need more troops in afghanistan  but we're also going to need more effective cooperation from the pakistani government in rooting out these safe havens  so there's some good news on the war front  but there's also some bad news  and one of the most important things for the next president is to work with the commanders on the ground  to find the right strategy to go after the central front on terror  go after al qaida  go after the taliban  while maintaining some of the gains that have been made in iraq  the other impression that i had was that the world is waiting for the united states to reengage  in the middle east  israelis and palestinians want to see us active and involved  and they're pleased that the bush administration has now participated in getting this annapolis   these annapolis talks off the ground  i think that prime minister olmert and president abbas are making some progress on that front  but what we need is sustained american engagement  without that american engagement  it's very hard to make progress  when i was traveling through europe  obviously  we had a big event in berlin that was a testimony  i think  to how hungry europeans are for american leadership that's not a matter of unilateral action  but a matter of engaging countries and peoples all around the world around our common challenges  but also our common opportunities  when you think about the big problems that we face here at home  they are connected to the problems we face abroad  if we can get more support for actions in afghanistan  those are fewer troops in the united states that we have to send  or it's less money that we have to invest in those efforts  which frees up money for us to invest in keeping folks in their homes here in the united states  or making sure that we're providing college scholarships for young people and make higher education affordable  there's a direct link between the energy problems that we're experiencing here at home and a lack of a coordinated policy in thinking about energy and climate change abroad  so one of the key insights that i come away with is it is very difficult for us to meet these  st century challenges unless we've got more effective partnerships with our allies and other countries overseas  and i think they are ready for it  and it offers the next president an enormous opportunity  but we're going to have to take action now  the last point i'd make is  while i was traveling  obviously  i was monitoring carefully the situation back here in the united states  i'm glad that we finally passed the housing bill  that the president has decided he will sign after all and that housing bill  i think  is a good start in trying to create a floor beneath which the housing market will not sink  we've got to prevent people from losing their homes  we've got to start shoring up home values all across the country  it's having a huge impact in terms of people's security and their bottom lines  we're going to have to do more  though  i think that the economy has worsened enough that we need a second round of stimulus  and tomorrow i'm going to actually be calling some of my top economic advisers together  paul volcker  warren buffett  bob rubin  a range of economists and experts on the financial markets  to start thinking about  how do we take some short term steps to shore up the economy  but also how do we take those long term steps  structurally  to start dealing with big problems like our dependence on foreign oil so it was a great trip  i missed my kids  i missed michelle  they came to greet me at the airport  which never happens  usually  michelle's like laughter b malveaux b  see you at home laughter b obama b  see you at home usually  i have to beg just to make sure that they're not asleep when i get home  but they surprised me at the airport  which was wonderful   b malveaux b  well  let's talk a little bit about this  because  just     years ago  you were a state senator who represented a district just a couple miles from where we are  since then  you have met with world leaders  you've travelled the globe  but clearly  eight days overseas doesn't make anybody a foreign policy expert  what more do you need to learn   b obama b  well  you know  i don't think that you ever stop learning  but i think it's pretty clear  suzanne  if you talk to the people i met with  they feel confident that i know what i'm talking about and what i'm doing  and the applause  so  one of the things that i think is important  though  for whoever the next president is  is to make certain that we project ourselves on the world stage with a sense of humility  a sense that we are listening to others  because one of the problems with our foreign policy is the sense that we are very clear about our own interests  but not so clear about other people's interests   b obama b  and that makes us less effective  in terms of advancing our security and the issues that are important to us   b malveaux b  is there an area that is a priority for you   b obama b  well  we've got to get afghanistan right  if you've got al qaida  you've got the taliban in training camps and safe havens just a few miles inside the pakistan border that can act with impunity  then it is going to be hard for us to stabilize afghanistan  and those folks are in a position then to plot how to kill americans  we've got to get the pakistani government involved in a much more significant way than they are right now  the other thing that we have to do is get the entire world united around the need for both big carrots and big sticks to present to the iranians so that they stand down on nuclear weapons  we cannot afford a nuclear arms race in the middle east  as volatile as that is   that place is  we cannot have iran getting a nuclear weapon  which then triggers a decision by other countries in the gulf to get nuclear weapons  that would not only affect our ability to operate in that theater  but that offers the prospect of terrorists getting their hands on a nuclear weapon  and there's no more important security agenda for us to address than the possibilities of nuclear proliferation  including into non state actors   b ratnesar b  senator  i want to ask you about a subject you've had to address repeatedly on this trip  which is the situation in iraq and the question of whether the surge has helped improve conditions there  during the primaries  you criticized senator clinton for failing to say that her vote authorizing the war was a mistake  now we have commanders on the ground pretty much saying that the surge has succeeded  and yet you've said that  if you had to do it all over again  you still would have voted against the surge  we're not going to ask you whether to   you know  to change your position here   b obama b  you're not going to ask me  but go ahead   laughter b ratnesar b  but i would like to know whether you feel that  after the last five years  haven't we learned that a commander in chief needs to be willing to acknowledge mistakes or errors in judgment when circumstances change   b obama b  you know  i mean  i have to say  it is fascinating to me to hear you guys re emphasize this over and over again  i have not heard yet somebody ask john mccain whether his vote to go into iraq was a mistake  i haven't  during the entire week that we were having this conversation   applause and so the question is  what are the strategic judgments that have to be made in order to make america safe  i strongly believe that going into iraq was a disaster  strategically  it distracted us from finishing the job in afghanistan  i have acknowledged repeatedly  in every one of these interviews  that the fact that we put more troops in there helped to quell the violence  i've been   i've been saying that all week  the question is whether or not my position  in suggesting that we need to begin a phased withdrawal  we should have begun it earlier  whether that position that i took was a mistake  and i do not believe it was  because i continue to believe that the only way for us to stabilize the situation in iraq   i believed it then  and i believe it now   is for the parties to arrive at a set of political accommodations  now  any time you put   to   u s  troops anywhere in the world  they are going to perform brilliantly and that is going to contribute to keeping the lid on violence  the question is whether or not that military action alone is sufficient to solve the problems  and had there been a continuation of a civil war in iraq in which sunnis and shias were going at each other full bore  in which sunnis were still aligned with al qaida  using military solutions to that problem would not have been sufficient  in my estimation  now  we don't know what would have happened had we followed my plan to begin a phased withdrawal to put pressure on the maliki government to start negotiating more effectively with some of these other parties  but that in no way takes away from the great work that our troops did and the terrific tactical work that general petraeus and ambassador crocker have engaged in  the key now is  how do we move forward  and i think that people believe that  at this point  we are in a position to start drawing down our troops  partly because we've got to get some troops into afghanistan and there's no other place for us to get them   b ratnesar b  so based on what you saw on your trip  you feel that the timetable that you've set out for redeployment still makes sense   b obama b  i think it's realistic  i think that  obviously  general petraeus wants as much flexibility as possible  and as i said during my trip  if i were in his shoes  i'd want as much flexibility  as well  but when you've got the prime minister of iraq  the people of iraq saying they are ready to take more responsibility  when we're seeing more iraqi forces take the lead in actions  we need to take advantage of that opportunity  particularly because we've got to deal with afghanistan  and we can't keep spending   billion a month in iraq at a time when we've got enormous pressing needs here in the united states of america  including  by the way  taking care of veterans who are coming home with post traumatic stress disorder  disabilities  and they are still not getting a lot of the services that they need   b malveaux b  senator  i want to use a word that you love to use   audacity  a lot of people looked at the trip and they saw the palaces  the world leaders  the   that were gathered in berlin  and they said   the audacity of this trip  it looks like he is running for president of the world and a lot of people looked and they want to know  what out of this trip did you take away that you feel makes you a stronger candidate to be a leader here   b obama b  well  let me make a couple points  first of all  i basically met with the same folks that john mccain met with after he won the nomination  he met with all these leaders  he also added a trip to mexico  a trip to canada  a trip to colombia  and nobody suggested that that was  audacious  i think people assumed that what he was doing was applause  talk to world leaders who we may have deal with should we become president  that's part of the job that i'm applying for   laughter and so   so i was puzzled by this notion that somehow what we were doing was in any way different from what senator mccain or a lot of presidential candidates have done in the past  now  i admit we did it really well   laughter applause but that shouldn't be a strike against me  you know  if i was bumbling and fumbling through this thing  i would have been criticized for that  and so   so that's point number one  i don't know the political effect of this when i come back  you know  i think people are worried about gas prices  they're worried about job security  they're worried about their retirement fund  as the stock market goes down  so probably a week of me focusing on international issues doesn't necessarily translate into higher poll numbers here in the united states  because people are understandably concerned about the immediate effects of the economy  and that's what we will be talking about for the duration  i do think that  in terms of me governing  being an effective president  that that trip was helpful  because i think i've established relationships and a certain bond of trust with key leaders around the world who have taken measure of my positions and how i operate and i think can come away with some confidence that this is somebody i can deal with  we're now going to open the floor to a few questions from journalists to senator obama  let's start off with our first questioner   b brian bull  wisconsin public radio  native american journalists association b  senator  i'm brian bull from wisconsin public radio and the native american journalists association  last february  the australian prime minister apologized for the past treatment of its indigenous people  last month  the canadian prime minister also issued an apology for its treatment of its indigenous population  would your administration issue an apology to native americans for the atrocities they've endured for the past   years   b obama b  you know  i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged  and i think that there's no doubt that  when it comes to our treatment of native americans  as well as other persons of color in this country  that we've got some   some very sad and difficult things to account for  you know  what an official apology would look like  how it would be shaped  that's something that i would want to consult with native american tribes and councils to talk about  and   because  obviously  as sovereign nations  they also have a whole host of other issues that they're concerned about and that they've prioritized  one of the things that i've said to tribal leaders is  i want to set up a annual meeting with them and make sure that a whole range of these issues are addressed  but i've consistently believed  when it comes   whether it's native american issues  whether it's african american issues and reparations  that the most important thing for the u s  government to do is not just to offer words  but offer deeds  and when you look at the situation on tribal lands  the fact that  by every socioeconomic indicator  native americans are doing worse than any other population on health  on education  on substance abuse   their housing situations are deplorable  unemployment is skyrocketing   you know  i have to confess that i'm more concerned about delivering a better life and creating a better relationship with the native american peoples than anything else  and that's what i want to engage tribal leaders in making sure happens   b malveaux b  when it comes to reparations  would you take it a step further  in terms of apologizing for slavery or offering reparations to various groups   b obama b  you know  i have said in the past   and i'll repeat again   that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed  and  you know  i think that strategies that invest in lifting people out of the legacy of slavery and jim crow  but that have broad applicability and allow us to build coalitions to actually get these things done  that  i think  is the best strategy  you know  the fact is  is that dealing with some of the   some of the legacy of discrimination is going to cost billions of dollars  and we're not going to be able to have that kind of resource allocation unless all americans feel that they are invested in making this stuff happen  and so  you know  i'm much more interested in talking about  how do we get every child to learn  how do we get every person health care  how do we make sure that everybody has a job  how do we make sure that every senior citizen can retire with dignity and respect  and if we have a program  for example  of universal health care  that will disproportionately affect people of color  because they're disproportionately uninsured  if we've got an agenda that says every child in america should get   should be able to go to college  regardless of income  that will disproportionately affect people of color  because it's oftentimes our children who can't afford to go to college   b malveaux b  can we hear from the next questioner   b dianne solis  dallas morning news national association of hispanic journalists b  hi  i'm dianne solis  i'm from the dallas morning news and the national association of hispanic journalists and my question is about immigration  percentage wise  the u s  has nearly as many immigrants as it did at its last historic high about a century ago  so should we have more immigration or less immigration  and where should people come from  particularly given that the biggest backlogs are out of latin america and asia for legal entry   b obama b  well  you know  i think that we are a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws  and the problem that i see is not the number of immigrants that are coming in   because we actually are advantaged in the united states by the number of immigrants coming in  the europeans  they've got the opposite problem  because they don't have a history of assimilating immigrants  they're actually losing population rapidly  and that could present a huge problem for them  in terms of their economy over the long term  same thing is true with japan  so the fact that we're getting people who still want to come to this country and live out the american dream  that's all good  the problem is when we've got a legal immigration system running parallel with an illegal immigration system  and i have said that i'm strongly in favor of a comprehensive immigration approach and that means cracking down on employers who are hiring undocumented workers so that they don't have to pay them minimum wage  don't have to pay them overtime  it means having serious border security  it means  also  providing a pathway to citizenship for those undocumented workers who are here  who have put down roots  getting them out of the shadows  they'll have to pay a fine  and they'll have to learn english  and go to the back of the line  but giving them an avenue to become fully part of the american   american society  i think that's very important  but part of comprehensive immigration reform is also looking at the legal system to make sure that we've got a realistic approach  you know  if you've got  year waiting lists for family reunification  that's pushing people into the illegal system  because it's very hard to see your spouse or your children outside of a country for   years as they wait to go through this process   b obama b  part of comprehensive reform would also involve examining where are various immigrants coming from  because  frankly  we are probably underrepresented when it comes to immigrants from certain parts of the world  the fact that it is much harder for haitians to immigrate than it is from persons from other countries  in some cases  despite relative similarities in need  that's something that we should examine  so   and one last point i'd want to make on the legal immigration system  we keep on jacking up the costs of immigration  and that skews things so that it is harder for ambitious  hard  working  well qualified poor folks from coming into this country and makes it much easier for mick jagger to immigrate  and i'm not sure that that's the kind of system that is fair and reflective of american values   b malveaux b  let's go to our next questioner  please   b leonard pitts  miami herald national association of black journalists b  good morning  senator  leonard pitts  jr  columnist with the miami herald and member of the national association of black journalists  you have repeatedly denounced false rumors that you are a muslim  my question and what i'm wondering is whether or not you feel that you have gone too far  whether or not  in answering these questions without challenging the implicit assumption that there's something wrong with being a muslim  you have actually done harm to the cause of muslims  you have visited churches and synagogues  when will you   or is it in the plans for you to visit a mosque   b obama b  well  leonard  i have to say  this is a classic example of a no win situation  right  so i try to correct something that is false and then people say   well  why are you correcting this thing in a way that isn't sufficiently    well  let me put it this way  first of all  i have repeatedly on various occasions said i am not a muslim  but this whole strategy of suggesting that i am is indicative of anti muslim sentiment that we have to   that we have to fight against  so maybe you haven't seen those quotes  but they're out there  and i've said them on more than one occasion  and i've said them on television  i've said them in print  i just don't like the idea of somebody falsely identifying my religion  i suspect that you wouldn't appreciate that  either  if you were a muslim and somebody consistently said you were a christian  i suspect that you would want to have that corrected  because that's offensive to   to your faith  you know  i think my credentials on supporting muslim americans are very strong  keep in mind  i'm the person who talked about discrimination against arab americans in my convention speech in   something that i hadn't heard too many other politicians talk about in the height of the scare after   i have visited mosques here in my community  repeatedly  on   and met with muslim leaders on a wide range of occasions  so  you know  what i would ask is that i am treated like other candidates in terms of expectations and that people look at my entire record  when it comes to anti muslim bias  when it comes to discrimination against muslims or arab americans  i have been at the forefront of those fights and will continue to be when i'm president of the united states   applause b ratnesar b  senator  let me ask you a no win follow up   laughter do you think you could have come this far if you were a muslim   b obama b  you know  that's a   that's a hypothetical that i don't know how to answer  i will tell you this  that the american people are more tolerant and more open minded than i think a lot of the pundits give them credit for  and i think right now what they're interested in is  who's going to help them get a job  who's going to make sure that they are able to send their kid to college  who can deliver for them  and if they have confidence that i am going to be able to make their lives better or work with them to open up opportunities for them to achieve the american dream  i think i'll have their support  and if i   and if  on the other hand  they think i'm not going to help them do that  then it doesn't matter what my religion is or what my skin color is  i probably won't get their support   b malveaux b  one more question from the audience   b john yang  nbc news asian american journalists association b  thank you  senator  i'm john yang  nbc news white house correspondent and a member of the asian american journalists association  i'd like to ask you about affirmative action  just this morning  senator mccain endorsed an arizona ballot initiative that would end preferences based on race and gender in that state  the author of that initiative  ward connerly  says your very success undercuts the argument for affirmative action  if the united states were to have a president of color  would there still be a need for affirmative action   b obama b  well  look  i am a strong supporter of affirmative action when properly structured so that it is not just a quota  but it is acknowledging and taking into account some of the hardships and difficulties that communities of color may have experienced  continue to experience  and it also speaks to the value of diversity in all walks of american life  we are becoming a more diverse culture  and it's something that has to be acknowledged  i've also said that affirmative action is not going to be the long term solution to the problems of race in america  because  frankly  if you've got   percent of african american or latino kids dropping out of high school  it doesn't really matter what you do in terms of affirmative action  those kids are not getting into college  and  you know  there have been times where i think affirmative action has been viewed as a shortcut to solving some of these broader  long term structural problems  i also think that we have to think about affirmative action and craft it in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged aren't getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who's struggled more  that has to be taken into account  so i think that  whether it's in terms   particularly  when it comes to college admissions  what i'm interested in is programs that take a wide range of issues into account  they   i think a university or a college should be able to take into account race  but they should also be able to take into account class  and hardship  and difficulty in making assessments about whether or not a young person is deserving of   of opportunity  i am disappointed  though  that john mccain flipped and changed his position  i think in the past he had been opposed to these kinds of ward connerly referenda or initiatives as divisive  and i think he's right  you know  the truth of the matter is  these are not designed to solve a big problem  but they're all too often designed to drive a wedge between people  and one thing that i'm absolutely convinced about  after having traveled all across the world over the last   last week  is that one of our greatest strengths is the fact that we come from so many different places  and yet we are all americans  the iraqis and the afghans  when we talked   when they talked to me about our military  not only were they impressed with how effective our military was  but they were also impressed with the fact that we had people from all walks of life who looked different all joining together as americans  they were impressed with the fact that our main commanding officer now in iraq is an african american  that  i think  is what makes america special  and we shouldn't lose that   we shouldn't either lose that or see that as a source of division  it should be a source of pride  and when properly structured  affirmative action  i think  can be a part of that   b malveaux b  and  senator  if i could just follow with this one point  it was about a year ago you were with many of us in this audience  and you were asked about whether or not you were black enough  obviously  that question has gone by the wayside  you have   percent approval rating from the african american community b obama b  now i'm too black   b malveaux b  too black  he said   laughter applause b obama b  i'm   i'm applause b malveaux b  i didn't say that b obama b  no  i'm   i'm just teasing   b obama b  but it does point   i mean  and this is what i was getting to leonard's question   i mean  i do think that there is this sense of going back and forth  depending on the time of day  in terms of making assessments about my candidacy  and i think that what we're trying to do is simply work as hard as we can around the values and ideals that led me into this race  and that i think are what are needed right now in order for to us move this country forward   b malveaux b  thank you very much  senator  for sharing your impressions of your trip and taking our questions this afternoon   b obama b  thank you  i enjoyed it  thank you very much "], ["obama1", "i've often said that this election represents a defining moment in our history  on major issues like the war in iraq or the warming of our planet  the decisions we make in november and over the next few years will shape a generation  if not a century  that is especially true when it comes to our economy  most of you probably know this   not just because whenever you open the paper or turn on the tv  you see reports of more job losses  more foreclosures  and prices rising at the pump  but because you feel the effects of all this every single day  you're working harder than ever to pay bills that are bigger than ever  you're driving less and saving less  you're struggling to balance work and family  you're worried about the value of your home and whether you'll be able to afford college for your kids and still retire at a decent age  for millions of families  these anxieties seem to be growing worse with each passing day  causing many people to lose faith in that fundamental promise of america   that no matter where you come from  or what you look like  or who your parents are  this is a country where you can make it if you try  now  part of the reason people are struggling is due to fundamental changes in our economy  over the last few decades  revolutions in technology and communication have made it so that corporations can send good jobs wherever there's an internet connection  children here in missouri aren't just growing up competing for good jobs with children in california or indiana  but with children in china and india as well  but what we also have to remember is that it wasn't simply globalization or a normal part of the business cycle that got us where we are today  it was irresponsible decisions that were made on wall street and in washington  in the past few years  we have relearned the essential truth that in the long run  we cannot have a thriving wall street and a struggling main street  when wages are flat  prices are rising and more and more americans are mired in debt  the economy as a whole suffers  when a reckless few game the system  as we've seen in this housing crisis  millions suffer and we're all impacted  when special interests put their thumb too heavily on the scale  and distort the free market  those who compete by the rules come in last  and when government fails to meet its obligation   to provide sensible oversight and stand on the side of working people and invest in their future   america pays a heavy price  so we have a choice to make in this election  we can either choose a new direction for our economy  or we can keep doing what we've been doing  my opponent believes we're on the right course  he's said our economy has made great progress these past eight years  he's embraced the bush economic policies and promises to continue them  our country and the working families of missouri cannot afford that  these policies haven't worked for the past eight years and they won't work now  we need to leave these policies in the past where they belong  it's time for something new  it's time to restore balance and fairness to our economy so it works for all americans  recognizing that we must grow together  wall street and main street  profits and wages  that starts with giving immediate relief to families who are one illness or foreclosure or pink slip away from disaster  to help folks who are having trouble filling up their gas tank  i'll provide an energy rebate  to help hardworking americans meet rising costs  i'll put a   tax cut in the pockets of   of workers and their families  including   million folks here in missouri  to help end this housing crisis  i'll provide relief to struggling homeowners  and to protect retirement security  i'll eliminate taxes for seniors making under   a year  if senator mccain wants a debate about taxes in this campaign  that's a debate i'm happy to have  because while we're both proposing tax cuts  the difference is who we're cutting taxes for  senator mccain would cut taxes for those making over   million  i'll cut taxes for middle class families by three times as much as my opponent  let me be clear  if you're a family making less than   my plan will not raise your taxes   not your income taxes  not your payroll taxes  not your capital gains taxes  not any of your taxes  and unlike my opponent  i'll pay for my plan   by cutting wasteful spending  shutting corporate loopholes and tax havens  and rolling back the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  but in this election  we can do something more than just provide short term relief  we can secure our long term prosperity and strengthen america's competitiveness in the  st century  it won't be easy  it won't happen overnight  but i refuse to accept that we cannot meet the challenges of our global economy  i'm running for president because i believe we can choose our own economic destiny  we can choose to go another four years with the same reckless fiscal policies that have busted our budget  wreaked havoc in our economy  and mortgaged our children's future on a mountain of debt  or we can restore fiscal responsibility in washington  we can go another four years with a broken health care system that's leaving millions uninsured  driving millions more to financial ruin  and making it harder for manufactures to compete  or we can finally solve our health care crisis once and for all  we can guarantee health care for anyone who wants it  make it affordable for anyone who needs it  and cut costs for businesses and their workers by picking up the tab for some of the most expensive illnesses and conditions  we can choose to do nothing about disappearing jobs and shuttered factories for another four years  or we can encourage job creation in the united states of america  we can end tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas and give them to companies that create jobs here in this country  we can make sure that our trade agreements work for both wall street and main street  and we can create nearly two million jobs by investing in our crumbling infrastructure and building new schools  roads  and bridges  and if anybody tells you we can't afford to make these investments  you just tell them that if we can spend   billion a month in iraq  we can invest some of that money right here in the united states of america  that's what we can do in this election  the choice is ours  we can go another four years without truly solving our energy crisis  we can choose my opponent's plan to give   billion in tax breaks to oil companies at a time when they're making record profits  or we can finally make america energy independent so that we're less vulnerable to oil price shocks and   a gallon gas  we can invest in renewable energies like wind power  solar power  and the next generation biofuels  and we can create up to five million new  green jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  that's what we can choose to do in this election  we can choose to stay mired in the same education debate that's consumed washington for decades  or we can provide every child with a world class education so they have the skills to compete and succeed in our global economy  we can invest in early childhood education  recruit an army of qualified teachers with better pay and more support  and finally make college affordable by offering an annual   tax credit in exchange for community or national service  these are the choices we face in november  we can choose to remain on the path that's gotten our economy into so much trouble  or we can reclaim the idea that in this country  opportunity is open to anyone who's willing to work for it  in the end  that's all most americans are asking for  it's not a lot  the people i've met during this campaign in town halls and living rooms  on farms and front porches   they know that government can't solve all their problems  and they don't expect it to  they're willing to do their part   to work harder and study more and replace the remote controls and video games with books and homework  they believe in personal responsibility and self reliance  they don't like seeing their tax dollars wasted  but they also believe in an america where jobs are there for the willing  where hard work is rewarded with a decent living  and where you can actually build a better life for your children and grandchildren  that's the promise of this country  and i believe we can keep it if we choose a new direction for our economy  a different course for our country  and get to work in the months and years ahead  thank you "], ["obama1", "it's great to be back in cedar rapids  where we've made so many friends throughout this campaign  this morning i met with some folks who've been devastated by the recent floods  like so many people across the midwest  they've seen their homes damaged  their lives turned upside down  and their future filled with uncertainty  i've seen the flood damage here in iowa and i've visited communities that have been devastated in my home state of illinois  now is the time for america to stand by those who have suffered so much  while helping them get back on their feet  we need to make sure that these communities have access to the disaster assistance that can help businesses reopen and people rebuild their lives  and we must make a firm commitment to rebuild stronger levees and higher floodwalls so that we prevent this kind of devastation instead of simply responding to it  we know that cedar rapids needs more than immediate assistance  because the problems that you're facing in your daily lives go beyond this year's storms  i've often said that this election represents a defining moment in our history  you're working harder for less  and for too many americans  the dream of opportunity is slipping away  that's why the decisions we make over the next few years will shape a generation  if not a century  given the seriousness of the issues  you'd think we could have a serious debate  but so far  even the media has pointed out that senator mccain has fallen back on predictable political attacks and demonstrably false statements  but here's the problem  all of those negative ads that he's running won't do a thing to lower your gas prices or to lift up the debate in this country  the fact is  these washington tactics do the american people a disservice by trying to distract us from the very real challenges that we face  that starts with energy  for decades  washington has failed the american people on energy  and that failure has led directly to our current crisis  george bush's approach was to let the oil companies write his energy policy  now  we can't afford four more years of more of the same  we can't afford to let dictators hold our national security hostage because of our energy dependence  we can't afford to endanger our planet because we can't shake an addiction to oil  and we can't afford more tax breaks for oil companies while they make record profits and you pay   for a gallon of gas  just today  we learned that exxon mobil made nearly   billion last quarter  think about that     billion dollars  no u s  corporation has ever made that much in a quarter  but while big oil is making record profits  you are paying record prices at the pump  and our economy is leaving working people behind  for far too long  we've had an energy policy that has worked for the oil companies   i think it's time that we had an energy policy that worked for the american people  and that's a change that we can't wait any longer to make  the choice in this campaign could not be clearer  senator mccain's proposing a corporate tax plan that would give   billion each year to the oil companies  including   billion for exxon mobil alone  he's proposing a gas tax holiday that will pad oil company profits and save you   at best   half a tank of gas over the course of an entire summer  so under my opponent's plan  the oil companies get billions more and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on big oil that got us into this crisis  that's a risk that we just can't afford to take  not this time  instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices  senator mccain touts his support for george bush's plan for offshore oil drilling  but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices  it won't lower prices today  it won't lower prices during the next administration  in fact  we won't see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost ten years  while this won't save you at the pump  it sure has done a lot to raise campaign dollars  last month  senator mccain raised more than a million dollars from oil and gas company executives and employees   most of which came after he announced his drilling plan in front of a bunch of oil executives in houston  this is not a strategy designed to end our energy crisis   it's a strategy designed to get politicians through an election  and that's exactly why washington has failed to do anything about our energy dependence for the last thirty years  it's time to ease the burden on working families  that's why i support energy rebates that will provide immediate relief for the american people  you won't have to trust the oil companies to pass the savings on to you   you will get these rebates directly  we do need to bring down gas prices  and as president  i will  it's time to crack down on speculators who manipulate the market  it's time to close the loopholes that allow them to game the system  it's time to make washington work for the american people  not the special interests  that's what we can do to bring down gas prices  and we do need to increase domestic production  and as president  i will  right now  oil companies have access to   million acres where they aren't drilling  including   million offshore  instead of simply giving the oil companies more  it's time to give them a choice  use the land you have  or lose access to it  if we drill in the   million acres that are available  we can double our domestic oil production and increase natural gas production by   percent  now if i thought that we could solve all our problems by opening up areas for drilling outside the existing moratorium  i'd be for it  but the truth is  that kind of drilling is not the answer to this crisis  america consumes   percent of the world's produced oil  but our nation holds less than   percent of the world's proven oil reserves  even more drilling will leave us with a permanent oil deficit  while we'd still be dangerously energy dependent  i don't want to look up in four years and see that oil companies and opec still have our economy in their grip  we can't have a policy that tinkers around the margins while going down an oil company's wish list   it's time to fundamentally transform our energy economy so that it works for the american people  my plan makes that change  my opponent's doesn't  and that's the clear difference in this election  my energy plan will invest   billion over the next ten years to establish a new american energy sector  and senator mccain's won't  we'll create up to five million american jobs   good jobs  jobs that can't be outsourced  and we'll help american manufacturers   particularly in the auto industry   convert to green technology  and help workers learn the skills they need to stay ahead in the global economy  i've supported investments in alternative energy  and senator mccain has opposed them  and as president  i'll invest in renewable energies like wind power  solar power  and the next generation of homegrown biofuels  that's how america is going to free itself from our dependence on foreign oil   not through short term gimmicks  but through a real  long term commitment to transform our energy sector  that's what we can choose to do in this election  we've also got to change how we use energy  i've fought for higher fuel efficiency standards in the senate  and when i'm president  we'll double our fuel mileage standards over the next two decades  this will save america half a trillion gallons of gas   that's the equivalent of cutting the price of a gallon of gas in half  and i'll provide tax credits and loan guarantees for our automakers to help them make this transition  finally  one of the fastest  easiest  and cheapest ways to conserve energy and use less oil is to make america more energy efficient and more competitive with the world  that's why  when i'm president  i will call on business  government  and the american people to make america   percent more energy efficient by   when all is said and done  my plan will create entire new industries and thousands of new businesses  while working to strengthen our national security and save our planet  these steps are not far off  pie in the sky solutions   the american people are ready to make this change  today  there are waiting lists for fuel efficient cars  i've seen a steel mill in pennsylvania that has become the home of a new wind turbine factory  a small business in nevada powered entirely by solar power  and farmers here in iowa who are testing the new  efficient generation of biofuels that can drive our economy  across the planet  countries like germany and the united kingdom have already implemented clean energy polices  now it's america's turn to lead  this election   at this moment in history   is too important for half measures  we started this campaign over eighteen months ago on the steps of the old statehouse in springfield with a simple belief that it was time for the american people to seize control of our destiny so that we could take this country in a new direction  after i announced my run for the presidency  our very first campaign stop was right here in cedar rapids  it was the dead of winter  the skeptics predicted we wouldn't get very far  the cynics dismissed us as a lot of hype and a little too much hope  and by the fall  the pundits in washington had all but counted us out  but the people of iowa believed that this moment could be different  you believed that democrats  independents  and republicans could come together behind a common purpose  you believed that with our nation at war and our american dream slipping away  this time  washington had to change  that's what it's going to take to work for a new energy future  now is the time to rise above the old politics and a broken energy policy  now is the time to move in a bold  new direction that lifts up our economy and secures our country "], ["obama1", "i stand here before you today feeling no small amount of gratitude  because i know that my story  and so many other improbable stories  would not be possible without all that the urban league has done to put opportunity within reach of every american  it's because of the doors you've opened  because of the battles you've fought and won  because of the sacrifices of people in this room and all those who came before you  that i come here today as a candidate for president of united states of america  and i'll never forget how my journey began  i'll never forget that i got my start as a foot soldier in the movement the urban league built   the movement to bring opportunity to every corner of our cities  as some of you know  after college  i moved to chicago and went to work for a group of churches to help families that had been devastated when the local steel plants closed down  i knew change in those communities wouldn't come easily   but i also knew it wouldn't come at all if we didn't start bringing people together  so i reached out to community leaders  and we worked together to set up job training to get people back to work and afterschool programs to keep kids safe  and to help people stand up to their government when it wasn't standing up for them  that work taught me a fundamental truth that has guided me to this day  that change doesn't come from the top down  it comes from the bottom up  change happens when you teach a child to read  or get a worker a job  or help an entrepreneur set up shop  it happens when you send a young person to college or help a family keep their home  that's the kind of change all of you are making every single day  because you know that civil rights and equal treatment under the law are necessary  but not sufficient  to seize america's promise   as dr  king once said   the inseparable twin of racial justice is economic justice  you know that you can't take that seat at the front of the bus if you can't afford the bus fare  you can't live in an integrated neighborhood if you can't afford the house  and it doesn't mean a whole lot to sit down at that lunch counter if you can't afford the lunch  you know that there was a reason why the march your fourth executive director  whitney young  addressed forty five years ago this summer wasn't just called the march on washington  and it wasn't just called the march on washington for freedom  it was called the march on washington for jobs and freedom  on that hot august day  whitney young declared that the civil rights for which they were marching were  not negotiable  but he also described other marches that lay ahead  the march from  ghettos to decent  wholesome  unrestricted residential areas  the march from  relief rolls  to  retraining centers  the march from  ill equipped schools which breed dropouts and which smother motivation  to  well equipped  integrated facilities throughout the cities  and he concluded   our march is a march for america  our march is a march for america  not black america or white america  not rich america or poor america  rural america or urban america  but all america  an america where no child's destiny is determined before she's born   and no one's future is confined to the neighborhood he's born into  an america where hard work is still a ticket to the middle class   and you can make it if you try  but somewhere along the way  we got off course  somewhere along the way  we let a reckless few game the system  we let special interests tilt the scale and distort the free market  we stopped making the investments in our children and our workers to help us all rise together  and today  we're all paying the price  today  we stand at a defining moment in our history  with seven straight months of job losses  with the highest percentage of homes in foreclosure since the depression  with family incomes down   and the costs of gas  groceries and health care up a whole lot more than that   so many people are looking at their children  wondering if they'll be able to give them the same chances they had  our cities have been especially hard hit   facing shrinking tax bases  growing budget deficits  and social services that just can't keep up with people's needs  and let's be very clear  when more than   percent of americans live in metro areas  when the top   metro areas generate two thirds of our jobs  when   of our metro areas now rank among the world's   largest economies   the problems of our cities aren't just  urban  problems any more  when rising foreclosures mean vacant homes  abandoned streets and rising crime that spills over city limits   that's a suburban problem and an ex urban problem too  when tens of millions of people in our cities are uninsured  and our urban emergency rooms are overflowing   that's a suburban and ex urban problem too  when urban roads  bridges and transit systems are crumbling  when urban schools aren't giving young people the skills to compete  so companies decide to take their business and their jobs elsewhere   that's a suburban and ex urban problem too  as president kennedy once said   we will neglect our cities to our peril  for in neglecting them we neglect the nation  so we've got a decision to make  we can continue president bush's economic policies   the policies that got us here in the first place  that's the course senator mccain would have us follow  he's said we've made  great progress economically  under president bush  well  i disagree  we face serious issues in this election   and have real differences  but i'm not going to assault senator mccain's character  i'm not going to compare him to pop stars  i will  however  compare our two visions for our economic future  senator mccain wants to keep giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  i want to end them and start giving incentives to companies that create jobs here at home  because i don't think   lost jobs this year is economic progress  he wants to give   billion worth of tax breaks to big corporations and the wealthiest americans  under his plan  more than   million middle class families won't see a penny in direct tax relief  i want to put a tax cut of up to   into the pockets of   of working americans  and if you're a family making less than   a year  my plan won't raise your taxes one penny   not your income taxes  not your payroll taxes  not your capital gains taxes  not any of your taxes  senator mccain is opposed to regular increases in the minimum wage   i want to index it so that it rises with rising costs  he thinks the earned income tax credit is fine as it is   i want to expand it  he has no plans to make childcare more affordable or help people get paid sick leave   while i do  in the end  senator mccain's plans  if you're doing spectacularly well now  you'll do even better  otherwise  you'll likely be stuck running in place   or fall even further behind  well  i don't think that's good enough  those policies haven't worked for the past eight years  they won't work now  and it's time for something new  it's time for policies that reflect the fundamental truth that we rise or fall as one nation  that's the truth at the heart of your opportunity compact   that we cannot have a thriving wall street and a struggling main street  that when wages are flat  prices are rising  and more and more americans are mired in debt  our economy as a whole suffers  our competitiveness as a nation suffers  our children's future suffers  so we all have a stake here  that's why your opportunity agenda is a compact   not a guarantee  not a promise   but a call to responsibility  because we know that government can't solve all our problems  and government can't and shouldn't do for us what we should be doing for ourselves  raising our kids the right way  being good neighbors and good citizens  becoming leaders in our industries and communities  we know that the american dream isn't something that happens to you   it's something you strive for and work for and seize with your own two hands  and we've got a responsibility as a nation to keep that dream alive for all of our people  that's what i was trying to do working with folks on the south side of chicago all those years ago  those folks weren't asking for a handout or an easy way out  they wanted to work  they wanted to contribute  they wanted to give their kids every opportunity to succeed  they just needed a chance  an opportunity to start climbing   the same thing we all want in life  and that's what this election is about  this election is about the   million people who don't have health care   including   in   african americans   people for whom one accident  one illness could mean financial ruin  that's why  when i'm president  we'll bring down health care costs by   for the typical family and prevent insurance companies from discriminating against those who need care most  we'll guarantee health care for anyone who needs it  make it affordable for anyone who wants it  and ensure that the quality of your health care doesn't depend on the color of your skin  this election is about the couple i met in north las vegas who saved up for decades only to be tricked into buying a home they couldn't afford   and all those families whose dream of owning a home has been shattered by that grim foreclosure notice in the mail  unfortunately  senator mccain's housing plan doesn't do anything to help many of the   million homeowners facing foreclosure   even as he supported spending billions to bail out wall street  i've got a different approach  two years ago  i offered a proposal to crack down on mortgage fraud  i worked with senator chris dodd and congressman barney frank to pass a housing bill that will help families refinance their mortgages and stay in their homes  and i support tax credits to help low and middle income americans afford their mortgage payments  because if we can bail out the investment banks on wall street who helped create this crisis  then we can certainly extend a hand to folks bearing the brunt of it on main street  this election is also about every child sitting in a crumbling classroom  every child taught by a teacher who isn't getting the support he or she needs  it's about the   million students who fail to graduate high school each year   including   last year in florida  it's about the  catastrophe  as colin powell put it  of children in our nation's largest cities who have a   chance   literally a coin toss   of graduating on time  now  i think it's interesting that senator mccain came before you yesterday and attacked my record on education reform  for someone who's been in washington nearly   years  he's got a pretty slim record on education  and when he has taken a stand  it's been the wrong one  so i'm happy to put my record and ideas up against his any day  he voted against increased funding for no child left behind to preserve billions in tax breaks for the wealthiest americans   tax breaks he wants to extend without saying how he'd pay for them  he voted against increasing funds for head start  and pell grants  and the hiring of   new teachers again and again and again  he even applauded the idea of abolishing the department of education  in fact  his only proposal seems to be recycling tired rhetoric about vouchers  now  i've been a proponent of public school choice throughout my career  i also believe that well designed public charter schools have a lot to offer  that's why i helped pass legislation to double the number of charter schools in chicago  but what i do oppose is using public money for private school vouchers  we need to focus on fixing and improving our public schools  not throwing our hands up and walking away from them  we need to stop the tired old attacks  and start getting results for our children  that's why i've been working to reform our schools for years  that's why i introduced a comprehensive plan last fall to recruit  prepare and retain effective teachers across america and why i added a program to the education bill that passed just yesterday to prepare high quality teachers in urban areas  that's why i introduced legislation to lower the dropout rate  starting in middle school  that's why  when i'm president  we'll give every child access to high quality pre kindergarten programs  recruit an army of new teachers for our communities  stop leaving the money behind for no child left behind  and make college affordable for anyone who wants to go  that's how we'll give every young person the skills to get a good job  that's how we'll ensure that america can compete in the twenty first century global economy  and if people tell you that we can't afford to invest in education or health care or good jobs  you just remind them that we're spending   billion a month in iraq  and if we can spend that much money in iraq  we can spend some of that money right here in america  in cities all across this country  we know the difference we can make when we work together to open the doors of opportunity wide enough for everyone to walk through  today  i'm thinking of one particular example from your history  back in january of   the urban league brought representatives from general electric to howard university to recruit graduating seniors  it was the first time in history that a company like that had come to a black university campus to hire students  the next year  thirteen companies recruited at howard  soon after that  more than   corporate representatives came to half a dozen other colleges and universities  and today  national and multinational companies recruit african american students at hbcus and colleges and universities across this country  think about all the careers launched  the wealth built  the homes bought  the tuition paid  and the dreams realized   think about all the grandparents looking back on their achievements with pride  and the children looking forward to their futures with hope   all  at least in part  because of what the urban league started on a winter day nearly   years ago  that is the march for america that whitney young spoke of all those years ago  the march that led so many of our parents and grandparents north to our cities  looking to start a new life  unafraid of hard work  determined to give their children opportunities they never had  as the poet alice walker once wrote   they knew what we must know without knowing a page of it themselves  that's what we've always done in america  dream big for ourselves   and even bigger for our children and grandchildren  and if you're willing to work with me  and fight with me  and stand with me this fall  then i promise you  we will build a nation worthy of their future  thank you  god bless you  and god bless america "], ["obama1", "i've often said that this election is a defining moment in our history  on major issues like the war in iraq or the warming of our planet  the decisions we make in november and over the next few years will shape a generation  if not a century  nowhere is that more true than when it comes to our economy  you don't have to watch tv or read the newspaper to know what's happening   you feel it in your own lives and in your own communities  july was the seventh straight month of job loss  gas prices are out of control  food prices are soaring  if you're lucky enough to have health care  your copays  deductibles  and premiums are skyrocketing  college is becoming less affordable  and we've seen more foreclosures than at any time since the great depression  back in the  s  your incomes grew by   and over the last several years  they've actually fallen by nearly   so for millions of families  these anxieties are growing worse  many people are losing faith in that fundamental promise of america   that if you work hard  you'll be able to build a better life not just for yourself  but for your children and grandchildren  part of it has to do with fundamental changes in our economy  over the last few decades  revolutions in technology and communication have made it so that corporations can send good jobs wherever there's an internet connection  children here in titusville aren't just growing up competing for good jobs with children in california or indiana  but with children in beijing and bangalore  but what we also have to remember is that our economic problems aren't simply due to changes in how our economy works  and they aren't just a normal part of the business cycle  they're also due to irresponsible decisions that were made on wall street and in washington  in recent years  we have relearned the essential truth that in the long run  we cannot have a thriving wall street and a struggling main street  when wages are flat  prices are rising  and more americans are mired in debt  the economy as a whole suffers  when a reckless few game the system  as we've seen in this housing crisis  millions suffer and we're all affected  when special interests put their thumb on the scale  and distort the free market  the people who compete by the rules come in last  and when our government fails to meet its obligation   to provide sensible oversight and stand on the side of working people and invest in their future   america pays a heavy price  so we have a choice to make in this election  we can either choose a new direction for our economy  or we can keep doing what we've been doing  my opponent believes we're on the right course  he's said our economy has made great progress these past eight years  he's embraced the bush economic policies and promises to continue them  well  i just want to ask you a simple question  are you better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago  can you afford another four years of the same economic policies that we've had under george w  bush  we've tried those policies  they haven't worked  it's time to leave them in the past where they belong  it's time for something new  it's time to restore balance and fairness to our economy so it works for all americans  recognizing that we must grow together  wall street and main street  profits and wages  that starts with easing the burden on hardworking families  if i'm elected president  i'll put a   tax cut in the pockets of   of workers and their families  i'll provide relief to struggling homeowners  i'll eliminate income taxes for seniors making under   a year  and i'll give working parents the support they need by making childcare affordable and expanding paid leave   and we'll make sure that women get equal pay for equal work  but you need relief right now  that's why yesterday  i announced a two part emergency plan to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track  the first part of my plan is to tax the windfall profits of oil companies and use some of that money to help you pay the rising price of gas  now  this is an area where my opponent and i disagree   because he opposes using this money to help you pay your bills  the other day  we learned that exxon mobil made nearly   billion last quarter  to put it another way  they made   every second  that's more than   in the time it takes you to fill up a tank of gas  and senator mccain actually wants to give oil companies like exxon another   billion in tax cuts  well  i don't think we should be giving tax breaks to oil companies that are doing better than ever at a time when you're struggling more than ever  it's time to use some of their record profits to help you pay record prices by putting a   emergency energy rebate in the pockets of working families  the second part of my plan is a   billion stimulus to help jump start job creation and help local communities that are struggling due to our economic downturn  half of this stimulus will go to state governments that are facing big budget shortfalls  and we'll invest the other half in our national infrastructure so we can create new jobs and save over one million jobs that are in danger of being cut  rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges  and repair our crumbling schools  and we have to do more than provide short term relief  we have to secure our long term prosperity and strengthen america's competitiveness in the  st century  one of the areas where we are in danger of losing our competitive edge is our space program  when i was growing up  nasa inspired the world with achievements we are still proud of  today  we have an administration that has set ambitious goals for nasa without giving nasa the support it needs to reach them  as a result  they've had to cut back on research  and trim their programs  which means that after the space shuttle shuts down in   we're going to have to rely on russian spacecraft to keep us in orbit  we cannot cede our leadership in space  that's why i will help close the gap and ensure that our space program doesn't suffer when the shuttle goes out of service by working with senator bill nelson to add at least one additional space shuttle flight beyond   by supporting continued funding for nasa  by speeding the development of the shuttle's successor  and by making sure that all those who work in the space industry in florida do not lose their jobs when the shuttle is retired   because we cannot afford to lose their expertise  more broadly  we need a real vision for space exploration  to help formulate this vision  i'll reestablish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system   a plan that involves both human and robotic missions  and enlists both international partners and the private sector  and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon  mars  and beyond  let's also tap nasa's ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change  under my watch  nasa will inspire the world  make america stronger  and help grow the economy here in florida  that's what this election is all about  it's about raising our sights  seizing this moment  and reclaiming our destiny in this country  and yet  at a time when the stakes could not be higher   when the challenges facing our country could not be greater   my opponent is talking about britney and paris  well  i think the american people deserve better  senator mccain and i have real differences and that's what we should be talking about   because we have a real choice to make in november  we can choose to go another four years without truly solving our energy crisis  or we can invest in renewable energies  create up to five million green jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  and build an american green energy sector so that we're less vulnerable to oil price shocks and   a gallon gas  that's what we can choose to do in this election  we can choose to do nothing about disappearing jobs and shuttered factories for another four years  or we can encourage job creation in the united states of america  we can end tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas and give them to companies that create jobs here in this country  we can choose to go another four years with a broken health care system  or we can finally guarantee health care for anyone who wants it  make it affordable for anyone who needs it  and cut health care costs for manufactures to help make them more competitive  that's a choice we can make in this election  we can choose to stay mired in the same education debate that's consumed washington for decades  or we can invest in early childhood education  recruit an army of qualified teachers with better pay and more support  and make college affordable by offering an annual   tax credit in exchange for community or national service  that's how we'll prepare every american to compete and succeed in our global economy  we can choose to go another four years with the same reckless fiscal policies that have busted our budget  wreaked havoc on our economy  and mortgaged our children's future on a mountain of debt  or we can restore fiscal responsibility in washington by winding down a war in iraq that's costing   billion a month  by cutting wasteful spending  by shutting corporate loopholes and tax havens  and by rolling back the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  these are the choices we face in november  we can choose to remain on the path that has led our economy into so much trouble  or we can reclaim the idea that here in this country  you can make it if you try  in the end  that's all most americans are asking for  it's not a lot  you don't expect government to solve all your problems  you want to be self reliant and independent  you want to be responsible for your own lives and take care of your own families  but what you do expect is a government that isn't run by the special interests  what you do expect is that if you're willing to work hard  you should be able to find a job that pays a decent wage  that you shouldn't go bankrupt when you get sick  that you should be able to send your children to college even if you're not rich  and that you should be able to retire with dignity and security  that's what you should expect  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  and if you're willing to stand with me and work with me and vote for me  then we will not just win florida  we will win this election  and then you and i together will change this country and change this world "], ["obama1", "we meet at a moment when this country is facing a set of challenges greater than any we've seen in generations  right now  our brave men and women in uniform are fighting two different wars while terrorists plot their next attack  our changing climate is placing our planet in peril  our economy is in turmoil and our families are struggling with rising costs and falling incomes  with lost jobs and lost homes and lost faith in the american dream  and for too long  our leaders in washington have been unwilling or unable to do anything about it  that is why this election could be the most important of our lifetime  when it comes to our economy  our security  and the very future of our planet  the choices we make in november and over the next few years will shape the next decade  if not the century  and central to all of these major challenges is the question of what we will do about our addiction to foreign oil  without a doubt  this addiction is one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced   from the gas prices that are wiping out your paychecks and straining businesses to the jobs that are disappearing from this state  from the instability and terror bred in the middle east to the rising oceans and record drought and spreading famine that could engulf our planet  it's also a threat that goes to the very heart of who we are as a nation  and who we will be  will we be the generation that leaves our children a planet in decline  or a world that is clean  and safe  and thriving  will we allow ourselves to be held hostage to the whims of tyrants and dictators who control the world's oil wells  or will we control our own energy and our own destiny  will america watch as the clean energy jobs and industries of the future flourish in countries like spain  japan  or germany  or will we create them here  in the greatest country on earth  with the most talented  productive workers in the world  as americans  we know the answers to these questions  we know that we cannot sustain a future powered by a fuel that is rapidly disappearing  not when we purchase   million worth of oil every single day from some the world's most unstable and hostile nations   middle eastern regimes that will control nearly all of the world's oil by   not when the rapid growth of countries like china and india mean that we're consuming more of this dwindling resource faster than we ever imagined  we know that we can't sustain this kind of future  but we also know that we've been talking about this issue for decades  we've heard promises about energy independence from every single president since richard nixon  we've heard talk about curbing the use of fossil fuels in state of the union addresses since the oil embargo of   back then  we imported about a third of our oil  now  we import more than half  back then  global warming was the theory of a few scientists  now  it is a fact that is melting our glaciers and setting off dangerous weather patterns as we speak  then  the technology and innovation to create new sources of clean  affordable  renewable energy was a generation away  today  you can find it in the research labs of this university and in the design centers of this state's legendary auto industry  it's in the chemistry labs that are laying the building blocks for cheaper  more efficient solar panels  and it's in the re born factories that are churning out more wind turbines every day all across this country  despite all this  here we are  in another election  still talking about our oil addiction  still more dependent than ever  why  you won't hear me say this too often  but i couldn't agree more with the explanation that senator mccain offered a few weeks ago  he said   our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making  and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country  what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those thirty years  he was in washington for twenty six of them  and in all that time  he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil  he voted against increased fuel efficiency standards and opposed legislation that included tax credits for more efficient cars  he voted against renewable sources of energy  against clean biofuels  against solar power  against wind power  against an energy bill that   while far from perfect   represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country  so when senator mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis  it's important to remember that he's been a part of that failure  now  after years of inaction  and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices  the only energy proposal he's really promoting is more offshore drilling   a position he recently adopted that has become the centerpiece of his plan  and one that will not make a real dent in current gas prices or meet the long term challenge of energy independence  george bush's own energy department has said that if we opened up new areas to drilling today  we wouldn't see a single drop of oil for seven years  seven years  and senator mccain knows that  which is why he admitted that his plan would only provide  psychological  relief to consumers  he also knows that if we opened up and drilled on every single square inch of our land and our shores  we would still find only three percent of the world's oil reserves  three percent for a country that uses   of the world's oil  even texas oilman boone pickens  who's calling for major new investments in alternative energy  has said   this is one emergency we can't drill our way out of  now  increased domestic oil exploration certainly has its place as we make our economy more fuel efficient and transition to other  renewable  american made sources of energy  but it is not the solution  it is a political answer of the sort washington has given us for three decades  there are genuine ways in which we can provide some short term relief from high gas prices   relief to the mother who's cutting down on groceries because of gas prices  or the man i met in pennsylvania who lost his job and can't even afford to drive around and look for a new one  i believe we should immediately give every working family in america a   energy rebate  and we should pay for it with part of the record profits that the oil companies are making right now  i also believe that in the short term  as we transition to renewable energy  we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas  but we should start by telling the oil companies to drill on the   million acres they currently have access to but haven't touched  and if they don't  we should require them to give up their leases to someone who will  we should invest in the technology that can help us recover more from existing oil fields  and speed up the process of recovering oil and gas resources in shale formations in montana and north dakota  texas and arkansas and in parts of the west and central gulf of mexico  we should sell   million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude  which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks  over the next five years  we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production  and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline  delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process  but the truth is  none of these steps will come close to seriously reducing our energy dependence in the long term  we simply cannot pretend  as senator mccain does  that we can drill our way out of this problem  we need a much bolder and much bigger set of solutions  we have to make a serious  nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away  last week  washington finally made some progress on this  a group of democrat and republican senators sat down and came up with a compromise on energy that includes many of the proposals i've worked on as a senator and many of the steps i've been calling for on this campaign  it's a plan that would invest in renewable fuels and batteries for fuel efficient cars  help automakers re tool  and make a real investment in renewable sources of energy  like all compromises  this one has its drawbacks  it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling  and while i still don't believe that's a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution  i am willing to consider it if it's necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan  i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good   particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil  and yet  while the compromise is a good first step and a good faith effort  i believe that we must go even further  and here's why   breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face  it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy  this transformation will be costly  and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration  it will likely require us to defer some other priorities  it is also a transformation that will require more than just a few government programs  energy independence will require an all hands on deck effort from america   effort from our scientists and entrepreneurs  from businesses and from every american citizen  factories will have to re tool and re design  businesses will need to find ways to emit less carbon dioxide  all of us will need to buy more of the fuel efficient cars built by this state  and find new ways to improve efficiency and save energy in our own homes and businesses  this will not be easy  and it will not happen overnight  and if anyone tries to tell you otherwise  they are either fooling themselves or trying to fool you  but i know we can do this  we can do this because we are americans  we do the improbable  we beat great odds  we rally together to meet whatever challenge stands in our way  that's what we've always done   and it's what we must do now  for the sake of our economy  our security  and the future of our planet  we must end the age of oil in our time  creating a new energy economy isn't just a challenge to meet  it's an opportunity to seize   an opportunity that will create new businesses  new industries  and millions of new jobs  jobs that pay well  jobs that can't be outsourced  good  union jobs  for a state that has lost so many and struggled so much in recent years  this is an opportunity to rebuild and revive your economy  as your wonderful governor has said   any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms 'climate change' or 'global warming ' just think  'jobs for michigan '  you are seeing the potential already  already  there are   jobs in your clean energy sector and   companies  but now is the time to accelerate that growth  both here and across the nation  if i am president  i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single  overarching goal   in ten years  we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela  to do this  we will invest   billion over the next ten years and leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy that harnesses american energy and creates five million new american jobs  there are three major steps i will take to achieve this goal   steps that will yield real results by the end of my first term in office  first  we will help states like michigan build the fuel efficient cars we need  and we will get one million   mile per gallon plug in hybrids on our roads within six years  i know how much the auto industry and the auto workers of this state have struggled over the last decade or so  but i also know where i want the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow to be built   not in japan  not in china  but right here in the united states of america  right here in the state of michigan  we can do this  when i arrived in washington  i reached across the aisle to come up with a plan to raise the mileage standards in our cars for the first time in thirty years   a plan that won support from democrats and republicans who had never supported raising fuel standards before  i also led the bipartisan effort to invest in the technology necessary to build plug in hybrid cars  as president  i will accelerate those efforts to meet our urgent need  with technology we have on the shelf today  we will raise our fuel mileage standards four percent every year  we'll invest more in the research and development of those plug in hybrids  specifically focusing on the battery technology  we'll leverage private sector funding to bring these cars directly to american consumers  and we'll give consumers a   tax credit to buy these vehicles  but most importantly  i'll provide   billion in loans and tax credits to american auto plants and manufacturers so that they can re tool their factories and build these cars  that's how we'll not only protect our auto industry and our auto workers  but help them thrive in a  st century economy  what's more  these efforts will lead to an explosion of innovation here in michigan  at the turn of the  th century  there were literally hundreds of car companies offering a wide choice of steam vehicles and gas engines  i believe we are entering a similar era of expanding consumer choices  from higher mileage cars  to new electric entrants like gm's volt  to flex fuel cars and trucks powered by biofuels and driven by michigan innovation  the second step i'll take is to require that   of our energy comes from renewable sources by the end of my first term   more than double what we have now  to meet these goals  we will invest more in the clean technology research and development that's occurring in labs and research facilities all across the country and right here at msu  where you're working with farm owners to develop this state's wind potential and developing nanotechnology that will make solar cells cheaper  i'll also extend the production tax credit for five years to encourage the production of renewable energy like wind power  solar power  and geothermal energy  it was because of this credit that wind power grew   last year  the largest growth in history  experts have said that michigan has the second best potential for wind generation and production in the entire country  and as the world's largest producer of the material that makes solar panels work  this tax credit would also help states like michigan grow solar industries that are already creating hundreds of new jobs  we'll also invest federal resources  including tax incentives and government contracts  into developing next generation biofuels  by   i will make it a goal to have   billion gallons of our fuel come from sustainable  affordable biofuels and we'll make sure that we have the infrastructure to deliver that fuel in place  here in michigan  you're actually a step ahead of the game with your first ever commercial cellulosic ethanol plant  which will lead the way by turning wood into clean burning fuel  it's estimated that each new advanced biofuels plant can add up to   jobs  expand a local town's tax base by   million per year  and boost local household income by   million annually  in addition  we'll find safer ways to use nuclear power and store nuclear waste  and we'll invest in the technology that will allow us to use more coal  america's most abundant energy source  with the goal of creating five  first of a kind  coal fired demonstration plants with carbon capture and sequestration  of course  too often  the problem is that all of this new energy technology never makes it out of the lab and onto the market because there's too much risk and too much cost involved in starting commercial scale clean energy businesses  so we will remove some of this cost and this risk by directing billions in loans and capital to entrepreneurs who are willing to create clean energy businesses and clean energy jobs right here in america  as we develop new sources of energy and electricity  we will also need to modernize our national utility grid so that it's accommodating to new sources of power  more efficient  and more reliable  that's an investment that will also create hundreds of thousands of jobs  and one that i will make as president  finally  the third step i will take is to call on businesses  government  and the american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity   by the end of the next decade  this is by far the fastest  easiest  and cheapest way to reduce our energy consumption   and it will save us   billion on our energy bills  since dupont implemented an energy efficiency program in   the company has significantly reduced its pollution and cut its energy bills by   billion  the state of california has implemented such a successful efficiency strategy that while electricity consumption grew   in this country over the last three decades  it didn't grow at all in california  there is no reason america can't do the same thing  we will set a goal of making our new buildings   more efficient over the next four years  and we'll follow the lead of california and change the way utilities make money so that their profits aren't tied to how much energy we use  but how much energy we save  in just ten years  these steps will produce enough renewable energy to replace all the oil we import from the middle east  along with the cap and trade program i've proposed  we will reduce our dangerous carbon emissions   by   and slow the warming of our planet  and we will create five million new jobs in the process  if these sound like far off goals  just think about what we can do in the next few years  one million plug in hybrid cars on the road  doubling our energy from clean  renewable sources like wind power or solar power and   billion gallons of affordable biofuels  new buildings that   more energy efficient  so there is a real choice in this election   a choice about what kind of future we want for this country and this planet  senator mccain would not take the steps or achieve the goals that i outlined today  his plan invests very little in renewable sources of energy and he's opposed helping the auto industry re tool  like george bush and dick cheney before him  he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems  and like them  he's found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long  in fact  he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month  most of which came after he announced his plan for offshore drilling in a room full of cheering oil executives  his initial reaction to the bipartisan energy compromise was to reject it because it took away tax breaks for oil companies  and even though he doesn't want to spend much on renewable energy  he's actually proposed giving   billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america   including   billion to exxon mobil  this is a corporation that just recorded the largest profit in the history of the united states    this is the company that  last quarter  made   every second  that's more than   in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas that's costing you more than  a gallon  and senator mccain not only wants them to keep every dime of that money  he wants to give them more  so make no mistake   the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain  and if he wins  they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy  well that's not the future i see for america  i will not pretend the goals i laid out today aren't ambitious  they are  i will not pretend we can achieve them without cost  or without sacrifice  or without the contribution of almost every american citizen  but i will say that these goals are possible  and i will say that achieving them is absolutely necessary if we want to keep america safe and prosperous in the  st century  i want you all to think for a minute about the next four years  and even the next ten years  we can continue down the path we've been traveling  we can keep making small  piece meal investments in renewable energy and keep sending billions of our hard earned dollars to oil company executives and middle eastern dictators  we can watch helplessly as the price of gas rises and falls because of some foreign crisis we have no control over  and uncover every single barrel of oil buried beneath this country only to realize that we don't have enough for a few years  let alone a century  we can watch other countries create the industries and the jobs that will fuel our future  and leave our children a planet that grows more dangerous and unlivable by the day  or we can choose another future  we can decide that we will face the realities of the  st century by building a  st century economy  in just a few years  we can watch cars that run on a plug in battery come off the same assembly lines that once produced the first ford and the first chrysler  we can see shuttered factories open their doors to manufacturers that sell wind turbines and solar panels that will power our homes and our businesses  we can watch as millions of new jobs with good pay and good benefits are created for american workers  and we can take pride as the technologies  and discoveries  and industries of the future flourish in the united states of america  we can lead the world  secure our nation  and meet our moral obligations to future generations  this is the choice that we face in the months ahead  this is the challenge we must meet  this is the opportunity we must seize   and this may be our last chance to seize it  and if it seems too difficult or improbable  i ask you to think about the struggles and the challenges that past generations have overcome  think about how world war ii forced us to transform a peacetime economy still climbing out of depression into an arsenal of democracy that could wage war across three continents  and when president roosevelt's advisors informed him that his goals for wartime production were impossible to meet  he waved them off and said  believe me  the production people can do it if they really try  and they did  think about when the scientists and engineers told john f  kennedy that they had no idea how to put a man on the moon  he told them they would find a way  and we found one  remember how we trained a generation for a new  industrial economy by building a nationwide system of public high schools  how we laid down railroad tracks and highways across an entire continent  how we pushed the boundaries of science and technology to unlock the very building blocks of human life  i ask you to draw hope from the improbable progress this nation has made and look to the future with confidence that we too can meet the great test of our time  i ask you to join me  in november and in the years to come  to ensure that we will not only control our own energy  but once again control our own destiny  and forge a new and better future for the country that we love  thank you "], ["obama1", "we meet at a moment when this country is facing a set of challenges unlike any we've ever known  right now  our brave men and women in uniform are fighting two different wars while terrorists plot their next attack  our changing climate is putting our planet in peril and our security at risk  and our economy is in turmoil  with more and more of our families struggling with rising costs  falling incomes and lost jobs  so we know that this election could be the most important of our lifetime  we know that the choices we make in november and over the next few years will shape the next decade  if not the century  and central to each of these challenges is the question of what we will do about our addiction to foreign oil  without a doubt  this addiction is one of the most urgent threats we've ever faced   from the gas prices that are wiping out your paychecks and straining businesses  to the jobs that are disappearing from this state  from the instability and terror bred in the middle east  to the rising oceans  record drought and spreading famine that could engulf our planet  now how  exactly  did we get to this point  well  you won't hear me say this too often  but i couldn't agree more with the explanation that senator mccain offered a few weeks ago  he said   our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making  and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country  what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those thirty years  he was in washington for twenty six of them  and during that time  he voted against increased fuel efficiency standards and opposed legislation that included tax credits for more efficient cars  he voted against renewable sources of energy  against clean biofuels  against solar power  against wind power  against an energy bill that   while far from perfect   represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country  and unfortunately  in this election  senator mccain has proposed an energy plan that's nothing but four years more of the same  he's offering a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy  he's offering a gas tax holiday that will pad oil company profits and save you   at best   half a tank of gas over the course of an entire summer  and he's offering   billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america   including   billion to exxon mobil  a company that just recorded the largest profit in the history of the united states  a company that  last quarter  made the same amount of money in   seconds that a typical ohio worker makes in a year  all while here in ohio  you're paying nearly   a gallon for gas   two and a half times what it cost when president bush took office  senator mccain not only wants oil companies to keep every dime of that money  he wants to give them more  well  i don't know about you  but i don't think that's the change we need  instead of offering a real plan to lower gas prices  the only energy proposal he's really promoting is more offshore drilling  this plan won't lower prices today  it won't lower prices during the next administration  the truth is  we wouldn't see a drop of oil from this drilling for at least seven years  while increased domestic oil exploration certainly has its place as we make our economy more fuel efficient and transition to other  renewable  american made sources of energy  it is not the solution  it is a political answer of the sort washington has given us for three decades  and while senator mccain's plan won't save you at the pump anytime soon  it sure has done a lot to raise campaign dollars  senator mccain raised more than one million dollars from the oil industry just last month  most of which came after he announced his plan for offshore drilling to a room full of cheering oil executives  so to sum up  under senator mccain's plan  the oil companies get billions more  we don't pay any less at the pump  and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis  the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain  and if he wins  they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy  that's the choice we face in this election  we can choose four years more of the same failed policies that have gotten us where we are  four years more of oil companies calling the shots while hard working families are struggling  that's what senator mccain is offering  or we can choose a new  clean energy future that gets us where we need to be  we can make a different bet   a bet on the ingenuity  industry and determination of the american people  that's what i'm offering  because after one president in the pocket of the oil companies   we can't afford another  for the sake of our economy  our security  and the future of our planet  we must end the age of oil in our time  now  we know our families need immediate relief from high gas prices   relief to the mother who's cutting down on groceries because of gas prices  or the man i met in pennsylvania who lost his job and can't even afford to drive around and look for a new one  and if i'm elected president  unlike senator mccain  i won't be giving tax breaks to oil companies that are doing better than ever while you're struggling more than ever  instead  i'll immediately give working families across america a   energy rebate  paid for with part of the record profits the oil companies are making right now  and in the short term  as we transition to renewable energy  we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas  right now  oil companies have access to   million acres where they aren't drilling  so we should start by giving them a choice  use the land you have  or give up your leases to someone who will  but the truth is  neither of these steps will seriously reduce our energy dependence in the long term  we simply cannot pretend  as senator mccain does  that we can drill our way out of this problem  breaking our oil addiction will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy  it will take an all hands on deck effort from america   effort from our scientists and entrepreneurs  from businesses and from every american citizen  we all know that this is the great challenge of our time  if we fail to act  there the implications will be grave for our economy  for our security  for our planet  but if we seize this moment  and meet the challenge  we can open to door to a new economy for the  st century that will bring new energy  new jobs and new hope to youngstown and communities across ohio and this nation  so if i am president  i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single  overarching goal   in ten years  we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela  to do this  we'll invest   billion over the next decade and leverage billions more in private capital to harness american energy and create five million new american jobs   jobs that pay well and won't be outsourced  good union jobs that lift up our families and revitalize our communities  there are three major steps i will take to achieve this goal  first  we'll commit ourselves to getting one million   mile per gallon plug in hybrid cars on our roads within six years  and we'll make sure these cars are built not in japan  not in china  but right here in the united states of america  we'll do it by investing in research and development  providing   billion in loans and tax credits to auto companies so they can re tool their factories to build these cars  and by giving consumers a   tax credit to buy them  that's how we'll make sure american workers and american companies can thrive in a  st century economy  second  we'll double the amount of our energy that comes from renewable sources by the end of my first term  that means investing in the clean technology research and development that's occurring in facilities all across the country  it means investing in tax incentives to encourage the production of renewables like wind and solar power and to develop next generation biofuels  it means finding safer ways to use nuclear power and store nuclear waste  and to use more coal  ones of america's most abundant energy sources  and it means working to modernize our national utility grid so it can accommodate these new power sources without being overrun by blackouts  the payoff from these investments in renewable energy sources will be renewable energy jobs across ohio and across america  now  i know that over the past eight years  you've lost more   manufacturing jobs in this state  but i also know that ohio has the second highest potential of all fifty states to create new wind energy manufacturing jobs   and investing in wind power could increase workers' wages in ohio by more than   billion through the year   i also know that with the right investments  this state could save   billion a year that you spend importing energy  and instead  power two million homes using wind power  finally  i will call on businesses  government  and the american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity   by the end of the next decade  this is by far the fastest  easiest  and cheapest way to reduce our energy consumption   and it will save us   billion on our energy bills  one report found that right here in ohio  improvements in energy efficiency can help save homes and businesses   billion in energy costs by   the state of california has implemented such a successful efficiency strategy that while electricity consumption grew   in this country over the last three decades  it didn't grow at all in california  there is no reason we can't do the same thing all across america  in just ten years  these three steps will produce enough renewable energy to replace all the oil we import from the middle east  along with the cap and trade program i've proposed  we will reduce our dangerous carbon emissions   by   slow the warming of our planet  and create five million new jobs in the process  i won't pretend the goals i've laid out today aren't ambitious  they are  i won't pretend we can achieve them without cost  or without sacrifice  or without the contribution of almost every american citizen  we can't  but i will say that these goals are possible  and i will say that achieving them is absolutely necessary if we want to keep america safe and prosperous in the  st century  it's necessary if we want our families to thrive again   to have good jobs with good wages that let them get ahead again  so in this election  we face a choice  we can continue down the path we've been traveling  we can keep making small  piece meal investments in renewable energy  keep paying more and more at the pump  and keep sending our hard earned dollars to oil company executives and middle eastern dictators  we can watch helplessly as the price of gas rises and falls because of some foreign crisis we have no control over  and uncover every single barrel of oil buried beneath this country only to realize that we don't have enough for a few years  let alone a century  we can watch other countries create the industries and jobs that will fuel our future  as our workers fall behind and our planet grows more unlivable by the day  or we can choose another future  in just a few years  we can watch cars that run on plug in batteries come off our assembly lines  we can see shuttered factories open their doors to manufacturers that sell wind turbines and solar panels that will power our homes and our businesses  we can watch as millions of new jobs with good pay and good benefits are created for american workers  and we can take pride as the technologies  and discoveries  and industries of the future flourish in the united states of america  we can lead the world  secure our nation  and leave our children a planet that is safer and cleaner and healthier than the one we inherited  this is the choice we face in the months ahead  this is the challenge we must meet  this is the opportunity we must seize   and this may be our last chance to seize it  so i ask you to join me  in november and in the years to come  to ensure that we will not only control our own energy  but once again control our own destiny  and forge a new and better future for the country that we love  thank you "], ["obama1", "we meet at a moment when this country is facing a set of challenges unlike

the country  what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those thirty years  he was in washington for twenty six of them  now  yesterday  senator mccain started running a tv ad saying that washington is broken  no kidding  it only took senator mccain those   years in washington to figure that out  but here's the thing  elkhart  i'm having a little trouble squaring that statement with senator mccain's declaration a few months ago that we've made  great progress economically  over the past eight years  or his boast that he's voted with president bush over   of the time  or his assertion that overall  the american people are better off now than they were when george w  bush came into office  you know from your own lives that we're not better off than we were eight years ago  back then  you were paying about   for gas  today  you're paying around   a gallon  back then  you were paying   a year on electric bills  today  you're paying more than   back then  you were paying about   for heating oil to get you through the winter  this winter  you're likely to pay nearly   this didn't happen by accident  it happened because for too long  we haven't had a real energy plan in this country  we've had an oil company plan  we've had a gas company plan  but we haven't had a plan that made sense for the american people  so if senator mccain wants to talk about why washington is broken  that's a debate i'm happy to have  because senator mccain's energy plan reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists  and it's no wonder   because many of his top advisors are former oil and gas lobbyists  instead of offering a plan with significant investments in alternative energy  he's offering a gas tax gimmick that will pad oil company profits and save you   at most   a quarter and a nickel a day over the course of an entire summer  that's why washington is broken  instead of supporting my plan to use the windfall profits of oil companies to help you pay rising costs  he's offering   billion more in tax breaks to oil companies like exxon that just made the largest quarterly profit in the history of the united states of america  that's why washington is broken  instead of offering a comprehensive plan that will lower gas prices  the centerpiece of his entire energy plan is more drilling  it's a proposal that won't yield a drop of oil for at least seven years  but it's produced a gusher for senator mccain  because after he announced his drilling proposal to a room full of oil executives  the industry ponied up nearly a million dollars in contributions  that's the kind of special interest driven politics that's stopped us from solving our energy crisis  and that's why washington is broken  so i know senator mccain likes to call himself a maverick   and the fact is  there are times when he's shown independence from his party in the past  but the price he paid for his party's nomination was to reverse himself on position after position  and now he embraces the failed bush policies and politics that helped break washington in the first place   and that doesn't exactly meet my definition of a maverick  by the way  while we're on the subject of senator mccain contradicting himself  a few days ago someone asked me what they could do to help america save energy  i suggested that we could get better gas mileage in our cars and save oil in the process just by keeping our tires inflated  and experts agreed  but senator mccain and his party mocked the idea  and they even sent out tire gauges  well  get this   last night  after all that  senator mccain actually said that he agreed that keeping our tires inflated was a good idea  we just agreed to a series of debates in the fall  but the most interesting one that's going on these days is the debate between john mccain and john mccain but understand  this isn't just about tire gauges and it isn't just about a single tv ad   no matter how misleading it is  it's about everyone in this room  it's about your lives and your family's future  because you know that what we've been doing for the past eight years hasn't worked   and that we can't afford another four years of the failed policies that we've had under george w  bush  and if you needed one more example of what's wrong with our energy policies or the bush policies in general  there's a new report out saying that iraq has hit a windfall because of high oil prices  they have a   billion budget surplus at a time when were spending   billion a month to defend and rebuild that country  their money is not being invested in services for suffering iraqis or reconstruction  while some of their money is sitting in american banks  american money is being spent over there  it's time for iraqis to take responsibility for rebuilding their own country  and it's time for us to address own concerns here at home  that's why earlier this week i laid out a plan to help end the age of oil in our time  here's how we'll do it  in the short term  as we transition to renewable energy  we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas  right now  oil companies have access to   million acres where they aren't drilling  so we should start by giving them a choice  use the land you have  or give up your leases to someone who will  but the truth is  this won't seriously reduce

know that this is the great challenge of our time  but it's also a great opportunity because if we can seize this moment  we can open the door to a new economy for the  st century that will bring new energy  new jobs  and new hope to families in places like elkhart  that's why i voted for an energy bill in the senate that was far from perfect  and that included tax giveaways to oil companies that i fought to eliminate  but that also represented the single largest investment in renewable energy in history  and that's why if i am president  i will put the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector behind a single  overarching goal   in ten years  we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela  to do this  we'll invest

force  i have spoken to president saakashvili  and conveyed my deep regret over the loss of life  and the suffering of the people of georgia  for many months  i have warned that there needs to be active international engagement to peacefully address the disputes over south ossetia and abkhazia  including a high level and neutral international mediator  and a genuine international peacekeeping force   not simply russian troops  no matter how this conflict started  russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country  russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia  there is no possible justification for these attacks  i reiterate my call for russia to stop its bombing campaign  to stop flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace  and to withdraw its ground forces from georgia  the georgian government has proposed a cease fire and the russian government should accept it  there is also an urgent need for humanitarian assistance to reach the people of georgia  and casualties on both sides  the united states  europe and all other concerned countries must stand united in condemning this aggression  and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis  we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence  this is a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia   the un must stand up for the sovereignty of its members  and peace in the world  i welcome the visit of the french and finnish foreign ministers to georgia as a first step toward mediation  there should also be a united nations mediator to address this crisis  and the united states should fully support this effort  we should also convene other international forums to condemn this aggression  to call for an immediate halt to the violence  and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia   including russia's interest in joining the world trade organization  the violence taking place along the black sea is just miles from sochi  the site for the winter olympics in   it only adds to the tragedy and outrage of the current situation that russia has acted while the world has come together in peace and athletic competition in beijing  this action is wholly inconsistent with the olympic ideal  while returning to a pre august   military posture is a necessary first step to resolving this crisis  we cannot tolerate the unacceptable status quo that led to this escalation  that means russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force  georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia  and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions  going forward  the united states and europe must support the people of georgia  beyond immediate humanitarian assistance  we must provide economic assistance  and help rebuild what has been destroyed  i have consistently called for deepening relations between georgia and transatlantic institutions  including a membership action plan for nato  and we must continue to press for that deeper relationship  the relationship between russia and the west is long and complicated  there have been many turning points  for good and ill  this is another turning point  let me be clear  we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government  and friendship with the russian people  we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation   but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century  not regression to the conflicts of the past  that is why the united states and the international community must speak out strongly against this aggression  and for peace and security "], ["obama1", " b host b br   i rick warren  pastor  saddleback church i   b warren b  welcome to the saddleback civil forum on the presidency  i guess you got my invitation  we're here in saddleback church in lake forest  california  tonight  we're going to use the interview format with these two candidates  we believe in the separation of church and state  but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics  because faith is just a world view  and everybody has some kind of world view  it's important to know what they are  now  what i decided is to allow for proper comparison  i'm going to ask identical questions to each of these candidates  so you can compare apples to apples  now  senator obama is going to go first  we flipped a coin  and we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence  now  each of the interviews will be segmented into four different sections  we're going to look at four different things  and the number of questions answered in each segment will depend on how succinct the senator is  i have to tell you up front  both of these guys are my friends  i don't happen to agree with everything each of them teach or believe  but they both care deeply about america  they're both patriots  and they have very different views on how america can be strengthened  in america  we've got to learn to disagree without demonizing each other and we need to restore civility   yes  we need to restore civility in our civil discourse  and that's the goal of the saddleback civil forum  so let's get started  and will you welcome senator barack obama  thank you  good to see you   b obama b  good to see you b warren b  thank you for being here   b obama b  thank you  pretty good crowd you've got here   b warren b  we're going to talk about four different issues tonight  barack  the first issue is on leadership   b obama b  all right   b warren b  these first set of questions deal with your personal life as a leader  and i'm not going to do this with any other segment  but as a pastor  i've got some verses that have to do with leadership  and the first issue is the area of listening  there's a verse in proverbs that says   fools think they need no advice but wise listen to other people  who are the three wisest people you know in your life  and who are you going to rely on heavily in your administration   b obama b  first of all  let me thank you for having he here  rick   b warren b  you're welcome   b obama b  i love the ministries that are taking place here at saddleback  this is the second time i have been here  the first time we had a wonderful time  excluding you of course    b warren b  and your wife   b obama b  i was going to say   you know  there are so many people that are constantly helping to shape my views and my opinions  you mentioned one person i'd be listening to  and that's michelle  my wife  who is not only wise  but she's honest  and one of the things you need  i think  any leader needs is somebody who can get up in your face and say boy  you really screwed that one up  you really blew that   b warren b  your wife's like that  too   b obama b  so that's very helpful  another person in that category is my grandmother  is an extraordinary woman  she never went to college  she worked on a bomber assembly line during world war ii while my grandfather was away  came back  got a job as a secretary and worked her way up to become a bank vice president before she retired  and she's a very grounded  common sense  no fuss  no frills kind of person  when i've got big decisions i often check in with her  now in terms of the administrations or how i would approach the presidency  i don't think i'd restrict myself to three people  there are people like sam nunn  a democrat  or dick lugar  a republican  who i'd listen to on foreign policy  on domestic policy  i've got friends ranging from ted kennedy to tom coburn  who don't necessarily agree on a lot of things  but who both have a sincere desire to see this country improve  what i found is very helpful to me is to have a table where a lot of different points of view are represented  and where i can sit and poke and prod and ask them questions  so that any blind spots i have or predispositions that i have  that my assumptions are challenged  and i think that that's extraordinarily important   b warren b  ok  all right  let's talk about personal life  the bible says that integrity and love are the basis of leadership  this is a tough question  what would be  looking over your life   everybody's got weaknesses  nobody's perfect   would be the greatest moral failure in your life  and what would be the greatest moral failure of america   b obama b  well  in my own life i'd break it up in stages  i had a difficult youth  my father wasn't in the house  i've written about this  you know  there were times where i experimented with drugs  i drank in my teenage years  and what i traced this to is a certain selfishness on my part  i was so obsessed with me and  you know  the reasons that i might be dissatisfied that i couldn't focus on other people  and i think the process for me of growing up was to recognize that it's not about me  it's about    b warren b  i like that  i like that   b obama b  absolutely  so   but look  you know  when i   when i find myself taking the wrong step  i think a lot of times it's because i'm trying to protect myself instead of trying to do god's work   b warren b  fundamental selfishness   b obama b  so that i think is my own failure   b warren b  what about america   b warren b  i think america's greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still don't abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers  you do for me  and that notion of   that basic principle applies to poverty  it applies to racism and sexism  it applies to  you know  not having   not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class  there's a pervasive sense  i think  that this country  as wealthy and powerful as we are  still don't spend enough time thinking about the least of us   b warren b  we've talked about this before  about the common good  and the common ground and common good  can you give me an example of a time   you know  i've seen that a lot of good legislation gets killed because of party loyalty  can you give me a good example where you went against party loyalty  and maybe even win against your own best interest  for the good of america   b obama b  well  you know  i'll give you an example that  in fact  i worked with john mccain on  and that was the issue of campaign ethics reform and finance reform  that wasn't probably in my interest or his  for that matter  because the truth was that both democrats and republicans sort of like the status quo  and i was new to the senate and didn't necessarily engender a lot of popularity when i started saying  you know  we're going to eliminate meals and gifts from corporate lobbyists  i remember one of my colleagues  whose name will be unmentioned  who said  where do you expect us to eat  mcdonald's  i thought  well  actually  a lot of your constituents probably do eat at mcdonald's  so that wouldn't be such a bad thing  but i think that we were able to get a bill passed that hasn't made washington perfect  but at least has started moving things forward  i guess the other example where i'm not sure that this was a   more of a partisan issue  but it was something i felt very deeply  was when i opposed the initial decision to go into war in iraq  that was not a popular view at the time  and i was just starting my campaign for the united states senate  and i think there were a lot of people who advised me  you should be cautious  this is going to be successful  the president has a very high approval rating and you could end up losing the election as a consequence of this   b warren b  let me ask it this way  a lot of times candidates are accused of flip flopping  but actually sometimes flip flopping is smart because you actually have decided on a better position based on knowledge that you didn't have   b obama b  right   b warren b  what's the most significant position you held ten years ago that you no longer hold today  that you flipped on  you changed on  because you actually see it differently   b obama b  because i actually changed my mind   b warren b  you changed your mind  exactly   b obama b  well  you know  i   i'm trying to think back ten years ago  i think that a good example would be the issue of welfare reform  where i always believed that welfare had to be changed  i was much more concerned ten years ago when president clinton initially signed the bill that this could have disastrous results  i worked in the illinois legislature to make sure that we were providing child care and health care  other support services for the women who were going to be kicked off the roles after a certain time  it had   it worked better than  i think  a lot of people anticipated  and  you know  one of the things that i am absolutely convinced of is that we have to work as a centerpiece of any social policy   b warren b  ok   b obama b  not only because   not only because ultimately people who work are going to get more income  but the intrinsic dignity of work  the sense of purpose   b warren b  we were made for work   b obama b  we were made for work  and the sense that you are part of a community  because you're making a contribution  no matter how small to the well being of the country as a whole  i think that is something that democrats generally  i think  have made a significant shift on   b warren b  what's the most significant   let me ask it this way  what's the most gut wrenching decision you ever had to make and how did you process that to come to that decision   b obama b  well  you know  i think the opposition to the war in iraq was as tough a decision as i've had to make  not only because there were political consequences  but also because saddam hussein was a real bad person  and there was no doubt that he meant america ill  but i was firmly convinced at the time that we did not have strong evidence of weapons of mass destruction  and there were a lot of questions that  as i spoke to experts  kept on coming up  do we know how the shia and the sunni and the kurds are going to get along in a post saddam situation  what's our assessment as to how this will affect the battle against terrorists like al qaida  have we finished the job in afghanistan  so i agonized over that  and i think that questions of war and peace generally are so profound  you know  when you meet the troops  they're      year old kids  and you're putting them into harm's way  there is a solemn obligation that you do everything you can to get that decision right  and now  as the war went forward  there are difficult decisions about how long do you keep on funding the war  if you strongly believe that it's not in america's national interest  at the same time  you don't want to have troops who are out there without the equipment they need  so all those questions surrounding the war have been very difficult for me   b warren b  we'll be back and we're going to talk about world view in the next section   i commercial break i b warren b  everybody's got a world view  a buddhist  a baptist  a secularist  an atheist  everybody's got a world view  i wrote or invited people who get newsletter to write in their questions  we have about   questions that came in  and i only have   in this section  so no matter how you answer these world view questions  somebody's not going to like it  because we're all different kinds of world views in america  but as   people want to know what your world view is  so as we go through this  these mine fields  let's just kind of tick them off  the mine fields of america  the first one is christianity  now  you've made no doubts about your faith in jesus christ  what does that mean to you  what does it mean to you to trust in christ  and what does that mean to you on a daily basis  what does that really look like   b obama b  as a starting point  it means i believe in   that jesus christ died for my sins  and that i am redeemed through him  that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis  yes  i know that i don't walk alone  and i know that if i can get myself out of the way  that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends  and it means that those sins that i have on a fairly regular basis  hopefully will be washed away  but what it also means  i think  is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words  but through deeds  the expectations  i think  that god has for us  and that means thinking about the least of these  it means acting   well  acting justly  and loving mercy  and walking humbly with our god  and that   i think trying to apply those lessons on a daily basis  knowing that you're going to fall a little bit short each day  and then being able to kind of take note and saying  well  that didn't quite work out the way i think it should have  but maybe i can get a little bit better  it gives me the confidence to try things  including things like running for president  where you're going to screw up once in a while   b warren b  yes  let's go through the tough ones  now  the most    b obama b  i thought that was pretty tough   b warren b  that was a freebie  that was a gimme  that was a gimme  ok  now  let's deal with abortion    million abortions since roe v  wade  as a pastor  i have to deal with this all of the time  all of the pain and all of the conflicts  i know this is a very complex issue  forty million abortions  at what point does a baby get human rights  in your view   b obama b  well  you know  i think that whether you're looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective  answering that question with specificity  you know  is above my pay grade   b warren b  have you    b obama b  but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion  because this is something obviously the country wrestles with  one thing that i'm absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue  and so i think anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue  i think  is not paying attention  so that would be point number one  but point number two  i am pro choice  i believe in roe v  wade  and i come to that conclusion not because i'm pro abortion  but because  ultimately  i don't think women make these decisions casually  i think they   they wrestle with these things in profound ways  in consultation with their pastors or their spouses or their doctors or their family members  and so  for me  the goal right now should be   and this is where i think we can find common ground  and by the way  i've now inserted this into the democratic party platform  is how do we reduce the number of abortions  the fact is that although we have had a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years  abortions have not gone down and that is something we have to address   b warren b  have you ever voted to limit or reduce abortions   b obama b  i am in favor  for example  of limits on late term abortions  if there is an exception for the mother's health  from the perspective of those who are pro life  i think they would consider that inadequate  and i respect their views  one of the things that i've always said is that on this particular issue  if you believe that life begins at conception  then   and you are consistent in that belief  then i can't argue with you on that  because that is a core issue of faith for you  what i can do is say  are there ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies  so that we actually are reducing the sense that women are seeking out abortions  and as an example of that  one of the things that i've talked about is how do we provide the resources that allow women to make the choice to keep a child  you know  have we given them the health care that they need  have we given them the support services that they need  have we given them the options of adoption that are necessary  that can make a genuine difference   b warren b  there's a lot more i'd like to ask on that  we have   other questions here  define marriage   b obama b  i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman  now  for me as a christian   for me   for me as a christian  it is also a sacred union  god's in the mix  but    b warren b  would you support a constitutional amendment with that definition   b obama b  no  i would not   b warren b  why not   b obama b  because historically   because historically  we have not defined marriage in our constitution  it's been a matter of state law  that has been our tradition  i mean  let's break it down  the reason that people think there needs to be a constitutional amendment  some people believe  is because of the concern that   about same sex marriage  i am not somebody who promotes same sex marriage  but i do believe in civil unions  i do believe that we should not   that for gay partners to want to visit each other in the hospital for the state to say  you know what  that's all right  i don't think in any way inhibits my core beliefs about what marriage are  i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others  even if i have a different perspective or different view   b warren b  ok  how about this  what about stem cells  we've had this scientific break through of treating these pluripotent stem cells in adult cells  do we still need federal funding for research  would you still support that for embryo stem cells   b obama b  keep in mind the way the stem cell legislation that was vetoed by the president was structured  what it said was you could only use embryos that were about to be discarded  that had been created as a consequence of attempts at in vitro fertilization  there were very tightly circumscribed mechanisms that were permitted  i think that that is a legitimate moral approach to take  if we are going to discard those embryos  and we know that there's potential research that could lead to curing debilitating diseases  alzheimer's  lou gehrig's disease  you know  if that possibility presents itself  then i think that we should  in a careful way  go ahead and pursue that research  now  if  in fact  adult stem cell lines are working just as well  then of course we should try to avoid any kind of moral arguments that may be in place  but i want to make a broader point  pastor rick  on an issue like stem cell research  it's not like people who are in favor of stem cell research are going around thinking to themselves  you know  boy  let's go destroy some embryos  all right  that's not the perspective that i think people come to that issue on  i think what they say is  we would not tolerate a situation in which  you know  we're encouraging human cloning or in some ways diminishing the sacredness of human life and what it means to be human  but that in narrow circumstances  you know  there is nothing inappropriate with us pursuing scientific research that could lead to cures  so long as we're not designing embryos for that purpose   b warren b  ok  we've got one last time   i've got a bunch more  but let me ask you one about evil  does evil exist  and if it does  do we ignore it  do we negotiate with it  do we contain it  do we defeat it   b obama b  evil does exist  i mean  i think we see evil all the time  we see evil in darfur  we see evil  sadly  on the streets of our cities  we see evil in parents who viciously abuse their children  i think it has to be confronted  it has to be confronted squarely  and one of the things that i strongly believe is that  now  we are not going to  as individuals  be able to erase evil from the world  that is god's task  but we can be soldiers in that process  and we can confront it when we see it now  the one thing that i think is very important is for to us have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil  because a lot of evil's been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil b warren b  in the name of good b obama b  in the name of good  and i think  you know  one thing that's very important is having some humility in recognizing that just because we think that our intentions are good  doesn't always mean that we're going to be doing good   b warren b  ok  all right  let's move on to some domestic issues  don't give me your stump speech on these  try to   let's go through it b obama b  all right  this is hard  i've been stumping for a long time b warren b  i know it is b obama b  all right b warren b  ok  the courts  let me ask it this way  which existing supreme court justice would you not have nominated b obama b  that's a good one  that's a good one  i would not have nominated clarence thomas    applause   i don't think that he   i don't think that he was as strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation  setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution  i would not nominate justice scalia  although i don't think there's any doubt about his intellectual brilliance  because he and i just disagree  he taught at the university of chicago  as did i in the law school b warren b  how about john roberts b obama b  john roberts  i have to say was a tougher question only because i find him to be a very compelling person  you know  in conversation individually  he's clearly smart  very thoughtful  i will tell you that how i've seen him operate since he went to the bench confirms the suspicions that i had and the reason that i voted against him  and i'll give you one very specific instance and this is not a stump speech b warren b  all right b obama b  i think one of the  b warren b  i think    b obama b  right  exactly  i'm getting the cues  i'm getting the cues  one of the most important jobs of  i believe the supreme court is to guard against the encroachment of the executive branch on the other  the power of the other branches b warren b  ok b obama b  and i think that he has been a little bit too willing and eager to give an administration  whether it's mine or george bush's  more power than i think the constitution originally intended b warren b  ok  the role of faith based organizes  recent poll says   percent of americans think faith based organizations do a better job at community services than the government  helping addictions  you know    applause   all the different homelessness  poverty  things like that  the civil rights act of '  says that faith based organizations have a right to hire people who believe like they do  would you insist that faith based organizations forfeit that right to access federal funds b obama b  well  first of all  i think you're aware of  pastor rick  that i gave a speech earlier this summer promoting faith based initiatives  i think that we should have an all hands on deck approach when it comes to issues like poverty and substance abuse and as somebody who got my start out of college working with churches  who are trying to deal with the devastation of steel plants closing in the south side of chicago  i know the power of faith based institutions to get stuff done  what i have said is that when it comes  first of all  to funding faith based organizations  they are always free to hire whoever they want  when it comes to their own mission  who the pastor is  various ministries  that they want to set up  but  and this has been a longstanding rule b warren b  college christians b obama b  yes  absolutely  when it comes to the programs that are federally funded  then we do have to be careful to make sure that we are not creating a situation where people are being discriminated against  using federal money  that's not new  that's a concept that was true under the clinton administration  that was true under the bush administration  there are  in   percent of the circumstances  it's not an issue because people are careful about how they use the funds  there are some tough issues  five percent of the situations where people might say i want to hire somebody of my faith for a program that is fully funded by the federal government and we're offering services to the public  and my    b warren b  in relief  like in katrina b obama b  right b warren b  if i took people to katrina  and i wanted to hire some people to do relief  if i took federal money to help in that relief  i wouldn't be able to say  i only want people who believe like we do b obama b  well  you know  it's one of those situations where the devil's in the details  i think generally speaking  faith based organizations should not be advantaged or disadvantaged when it comes to getting federal funds  by virtue of the fact that they're faith  based organizations  they just want a level playing field  but what we do want to make sure of is that as a general principle we're not using federal funding to discriminate  but that is only when it comes to the narrow program that is being funded by the federal government  that does not affect any of the other ministries that are being taken  that are taking place b warren b  ok  let's go to education  america right now ranks  th in high school graduations  we're first in incarcerations b obama b  not good b warren b  not good    percent of americans recently polled said they believe in merit pay  now  for teachers  do you   i'm not asking do you think all teachers should get a raise  do you think better teachers should be paid better  they should be paid more than poor teachers b obama b  i think that we should   and i've said this publicly  that we should set up a system of performance pay for teachers  negotiated with teachers  worked with the teachers to figure out the assessments  so that they feel like they're being judged fairly  it's not at the whim of the principal  that it's not simply based on a single high stakes standardized test but the basic notion that teaching is a profession  that teachers are underpaid  so we need to pay them all more  but   and create a higher baseline  but then we should also reward excellence b warren b  reward excellence b obama b  i think that is a concept that all of us should embrace    applause  b warren b  ok  taxes  this is a real simple question  define rich    laughter   i mean give me a number  is it       everybody keeps talking about who we're going to tax  how can you define that b obama b  you know  if you've got book sales of   million  then you qualify  laughter     applause  b obama b  yes b warren b  no  i'm not asking about me b obama b  look  the   here's how i think about it  here's how i think about it  and this is reflected in my tax plan  if you are making   a year or less  as a family  then you're middle class or you may be poor  but   down you're basically middle class  obviously depends on the region where you're living b warren b  in this region  you're poor b obama b  yes  well   depending  i don't know what housing practices are going  i would argue that if you're making more than   then you're in the top three percent  four percent of this country  you're doing well  now  these things are all relative  and i'm not suggesting that everybody is making over   is living on easy street  but the question that i think we have to ask ourselves is  if we believe in good schools  if we believe in good roles  if we want to make sure that kids can go to college  if we don't want to leave a mountain of debt for the next generation  then we've got to pay for these things  they don't come for free  and it is irresponsible i believe it is irresponsible intergenerationally for us to invest or for us to spend   billion a month on a war and not have a way of paying for it  that  i think  is unacceptable  so nobody likes to pay taxes  i haven't sold   million books but i've been selling some books lately  and so i write a pretty big check to uncle sam  nobody likes it  what i can say is under the approach i'm taking  if you make   or less  you will see a tax cut  if you're making   a year or more  you're going to see a modest increase  what i'm trying to do is create a sense of balance  and fairness in our tax code  one thing i think we can all agree on  is that it should be simpler so that you don't have all these loopholes and big stacks of stuff that you've got to comb through  which wastes a huge amount of money and allows special interests to take advantage of things that ordinary people cannot take advantage of b warren b  ok  we'll be right back i commercial break i b warren b  welcome back to the saddleback civil forum on the presidency  in this last section  i want us to talk about america's responsibility to the rest of the world  we are the most blessed nation in the world  and we're blessed to be a blessing  to whom much is given  much is required  so let me   let's just go down some of the issues  international issues  first thing  let's just talk about war  as an american  what's worth dying for  what's worth having sacrifice of the american lives for b obama b  well  obviously american freedom  american lives  america's national interests  you know  i was just with my family on vacation in hawaii and visited the place where my grandfather is laid to rest  the punch bowl national cemetery b warren b  punch bowl  yes b obama b  and then went out to arizona  out in pearl harbor and you're reminded of the sacrifices that have been made on behalf of our freedom  and i think that is a solemn obligation that we all have  i think that we also have forged alliances with countries  nato being a prime example  where we have pledged to act militarily for the common defense  that is in our national interest and that is something that i think we have to abide by b warren b  what would be the criteria that you would commit troops to end the genocide  for instance  it's like what's going on in darfur or could happen in georgia or anywhere else b obama b  you know   i don't think that there is a hard and fast line at which you say  ok  we are going in  i think it is always a judgment call  i think that the basic principle has to be that we have it within our power to prevent mass killing and genocide  and we can work in concert with the international community to prevent it  then we should act now  we have to do so     applause   we have to do so   i think that international component is very critical  we may not get   percent agreement b warren b  the war without u n  approval b obama b  yes  absolutely  but i think you take an example like bosnia  when we went in and undoubtedly saved lives  we did not have u n  approval  but there was a strong international case that had been made that ethnic cleansing was taking place  and under those circumstances  when we have it within our power  we should  you know  we should take action b warren b  ok  this one is dear to my heart  most people don't know that there are   million orphans in the world    million kids growing up without mommies and dads  they don't need to be in an orphanage  they need to be in families  but a lot of families can't afford to take these kids in  would you be willing to consider and even commit to doing some kind of emergency plan for orphans  like president bush did with aids  almost a president's emergency plan for orphans  to deal with this issue b obama b  i cheated a little bit  i actually looked at this idea ahead of time  and i think it is a great idea  i think it's something that we should sit down and figure out  working between non  governmental organizations  you know  national institutions  the u s  government and try to figure out what can we do  i think that part of our plan  though  has to be  how do we prevent more orphans in the first place  and that means that we're helping to build a public health infrastructure around the world  that we are  you know  building on the great work that you  and by the way  this president has done when it comes to aids funding around the world  i think it helps  i'm often a critic of president bush  but i think the pepfar program has saved lives and has done very good work and he deserves enormous credit for that b warren b  religious persecution  what do you think the u s  should do to end religious persecution  for instance  in china  in iraq  and in many of our supposed allies  i'm not just talking about persecution of christianity  but there's religious persecution around the world that persecutes millions of people b obama b  well  i think the first thing we have to do is to bear witness and speak out  and not pretend that it's not taking place  you know  our relationship with china  for example  is a very complicated one  you know  we're trading partners  unfortunately  they are now lenders to us because we haven't been taking care of our economy the way we need to be  i don't think any of us want to see military conflict with china so we want to manage this relationship and move them into the world community as a full partner  but we can't purchase that by ignoring the very real prosecutions  persecutions that are taking place  and so having an administration that is speaking out  joining in international forums  where we can point out human rights abuses  and the absence of religious freedom  that  i think  is absolutely critical  over time  what we are doing is setting up new norms and creating a universal principle that people's faith and people's beliefs have to be protected and as you said  it's not just christians  and we've got to make sure  you know  one thing i think is very important for us to do on all of these issues is to lead by example  that's why i think it's so important for us to have religious tolerance here in the united states  that's why it's so important for us  when we are criticizing other countries about rule of law to make sure that we're abiding by rule of law  and habeas corpus  and we're not engaging in torture  because that gives us a moral standing to talk about these other issues b warren b  ok  another issue  the third largest and the fastest growing criminal industry in the world is human trafficking    billion a year  a lot of people don't know that there are about   million people living in slavery right now  many of them in sex trafficking than any others  how do we speak out and how do you plan to do something about that b obama b  this has to be a top priority and this is an area where we've already seen bipartisan agreement on this issue  what we have to do is to create better  more effective tools for prosecuting those who are engaging in human trafficking and we have to do that within our country  sadly  there are thousands who are trapped in various forms of enslavement  here in our country oftentimes young women who are caught up in prostitution  so we've got to give prosecutors the tools to crack down on these human trafficking networks  internationally  we've got to speak out and we've got to forge alliances with other countries to share intelligence  to roll up the financing networks that are involved in them  it is a debasement of our common humanity  whenever we see something like that taking place b warren b  ok  in a minute  in one minute  because i know you could take the entire hour on this  tell me in a minute why you want to be president b obama b  you know  i remember what my mother used to tell me  i was talking to somebody a while back and i said the one time that she would get really angry with me is if she ever thought that i was being mean to somebody  or unfair to somebody  she said  imagine standing in their shoes  imagine looking through their eyes  that basic idea of empathy  and that  i think  is what's made america special is that notion  that everybody has got a shot  if we see somebody down and out  if we see a kid who can't afford college  that we care for them  too and i want to be president because that's the america i believe in and i feel like that american dream is slipping away  i think we are at a critical juncture  economically  i think we are at a critical juncture  internationally  we've got to make some big decisions not just for us for the next generation and we keep on putting it off  and unfortunately  our politics is broken and washington is so broken  that we can't bring together people of goodwill to solve these common problems  i think i have the ability to build bridges across partisan lines  racial  regional lines to get people to work on some common sense solutions to critical issues and i hope that i have the opportunity to do that  applause  b warren b  i'm going to skip over a couple of these other important ones and just ask you  what do you say to people who opposed me asking you these questions  that will be the last one b obama b  these are the kinds of forums that we need  where we have a conversation  and i think based on     applause     based on these conversations  the american people can make a good judgment  i mean  one of the things  if you're a person of faith like me  i believe that things will work out and we will get the president that we need  what you want  though  is just to make sure that people have good information  that they're not just consuming negative ads or the kind of nasty tit for tat that has become so common in politics you know  i want people to know me well and i want people   i'm sure john mccain feels the same way  and that if we are both known and people know where we stand on issues  you know  i trust in the american people  they're going to make a good decision and we're going to be able to solve the big problems that we face b warren b  ok  i've got   seconds  what would you tell the american public if you knew there wouldn't be any repercussions  laughter  b obama b  well  you know what i would tell them  is that solving big problems  like for example  energy  is not going to be easy and everybody is going to have to get involved  and we are going to have to all think about how are we using energy more efficiently and there's going to be a price to pay in transitioning to a more energy  efficient economy and dealing with issues like climate change  and if we pretend like everything is free  and there's no sacrifice involved  then we are betraying the tradition of america i think about my grandparents' generation  coming out of a depression  fighting world war ii  you know  they've confronted some challenges we can't even imagine  if they were willing to make sacrifices on our behalf  we should be able to make some sacrifices on behalf of the next generation b warren b  senator  thank you b obama b  thank you b warren b  would you stand  would you stand  and thank senator barack obama b obama b  thank you  thank you b warren b  thank you b obama b  thank you so much   b warren b  and while you're still standing  would you welcome at the same time senator john mccain  would you welcome him  as he comes out here hi  john  good to see you b mccain b  good to see you b warren b  thank you guys  thank you so much end of obama portion "], ["obama1", "thank you  commander lisicki  for your leadership  let me also acknowledge the leadership of virginia carman  the president of the vfw ladies auxiliary  as well as my friend jim webb who will be speaking here later today  finally  let me thank all of the members of the veterans of foreign wars of the united states of america for inviting me back to this convention  it is a privilege to be among so many who have given so much for our country  i stand before you today at a defining moment in our history  we are in the midst of two wars  the terrorists who attacked us on   are still at large  russia has invaded the sovereign nation of georgia  iran is pursuing nuclear weapons  the next commander in chief is going to have to exercise the best possible judgment in getting us through these difficult times  yesterday  senator mccain came before you  he is a man who has served this nation honorably  and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief  but instead of just offering policy answers  he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks  he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not  he said that i am for a path of  retreat and failure  and he declared   behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president    suggesting  as he has so many times  that i put personal ambition before my country  that is john mccain's prerogative  he can run that kind of campaign  and   frankly   that's how political campaigns have been run in recent years  but i believe the american people are better than that  i believe that this defining momenttan  demands something more of us  if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart  then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities  if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponent's patriotism to win an election  then the american people will lose  the times are too serious for this kind of politics  the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great  so let me begin by offering my judgment about what we've done  where we are  and where we need to go  six years ago  i stood up at a time when it was politically difficult to oppose going to war in iraq  and argued that our first priority had to be finishing the fight against osama bin laden and al qaeda in afghanistan  senator mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after   and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the   attacks  and that   as despicable as saddam hussein was   posed no imminent threat to the american people  two of the biggest beneficiaries of that decision were al qaeda's leadership  which no longer faced the pressure of america's focused attention  and iran  which has advanced its nuclear program  continued its support for terror  and increased its influence in iraq and the region  in the run up to the invasion of iraq  i warned that war would fan the flames of extremism in the middle east  create new centers of terrorism  and tie us down in a costly and open ended occupation  senator mccain predicted that we'd be greeted as liberators  and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues  for the good of our country  i wish he had been right  and i had been wrong  but that's not what history shows  senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors  his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge  let me once again praise general petraeus and ambassador crocker   they are outstanding americans  in iraq  gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military  the increasing capability of iraq's security forces  the ceasefire of shiite militias  and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda  those are the facts  and all americans welcome them  but understand what the essential argument was about  before the surge  i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political   the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future  that holds true today  we have lost over a thousand american lives and spent hundreds of billions of dollars since the surge began  but iraq's leaders still haven't made hard compromises or substantial investments in rebuilding their country  our military is badly overstretched   a fact that has surely been noted in capitals around the world  and while we pay a heavy price in iraq   and americans pay record prices at the pump   iraq's government is sitting on a   billion dollar budget surplus from windfall oil profits  let's be clear  our troops have completed every mission they've been given  they have created the space for political reconciliation  now it must be filled by an iraqi government that reconciles its differences and spends its oil profits to meet the needs of its people  iraqi inaction threatens the progress we've made and creates an opening for iran and the  special groups  it supports  it's time to press the iraqis to take responsibility for their future  the best way to do that is a responsible redeployment of our combat brigades  carried out in close consultation with commanders on the ground  we can safely redeploy at a pace that removes our combat brigades in   months  that would be well into     seven years after the war began  after this redeployment  we'll keep a residual force to target remnants of al qaeda  to protect our service members and diplomats  and to train iraq's security forces if the iraqis make political progress  iraq's democratically elected prime minister has embraced this timeframe  now it's time to succeed in iraq by turning iraq over to its sovereign government  we should not keep sending our troops to fight tour after tour of duty while our military is overstretched  we should not keep spending   billion a month in iraq while americans struggle in a sluggish economy  ending the war will allow us to invest in america  to strengthen our military  and to finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan and the border region of pakistan  this is the central front in the war on terrorism  this is where the taliban is gaining strength and launching new attacks  including one that just took the life of ten french soldiers  this is where osama bin laden and the same terrorists who killed nearly   americans on our own soil are hiding and plotting seven years after   this is a war that we have to win  and as commander in chief  i will have no greater priority than taking out these terrorists who threaten america  and finishing the job against the taliban  for years  i have called for more resources and more troops to finish the fight in afghanistan  with his overwhelming focus on iraq  senator mccain argued that we could just  muddle through  in afghanistan  and only came around to supporting my call for more troops last month  now  we need a policy of  more for more    more from america and our nato allies  and more from the afghan government  that's why i've called for at least two additional u s  combat brigades and an additional   billion in non military assistance for afghanistan  with a demand for more action from the afghan government to take on corruption and counternarcotics  and to improve the lives of the afghan people  we must also recognize that we cannot succeed in afghanistan or secure america as long as there is a terrorist safe haven in northwest pakistan  a year ago  i said that we must take action against bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights and pakistan cannot or will not act  senator mccain criticized me and claimed that i was for  bombing our ally  so for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell  senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border  instead  he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people  i argued for years that we need to move from a  musharraf policy  to a  pakistan policy  we must move beyond an alliance built on mere convenience or a relationship with one man  now  with president musharraf's resignation  we have the opportunity to do just that  that's why i've cosponsored a bill to triple non military aid to the pakistani people  while ensuring that the military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the taliban and al qaeda in the tribal regions of pakistan  today  our attention is also on the republic of georgia  and senator mccain and i both strongly support the people of georgia and the americans delivering humanitarian aid  there is no possible justification for russia's actions  russian troops have yet to begin the withdrawal required by the cease fire signed by their president  and we are hearing reports of russian atrocities  burning wheat fields  brutal killing  and the destruction of georgia's infrastructure and military assets  this crisis underscores the need for engaged u s  leadership in the world  we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted  our resources overstretched  and our alliances frayed  american leadership means getting engaged earlier to shape events so that we're not merely responding to them  that's why i'm committed to renewing our leadership and rebuilding our alliances as president of the united states  for months  i have called for active international engagement to resolve the disputes over south ossetia and abkhazia  i made it crystal clear before  at the beginning of  and during this conflict that georgia's territorial integrity must be respected  and that georgia should be integrated into transatlantic institutions  i have condemned russian aggression  and today i reiterate my demand that russia abide by the cease fire  russia must know that its actions will have consequences  they will imperil the civil nuclear agreement  and russia's standing in the international community   including the nato russia council  and russia's desire to participate in organizations like the wto and the oecd  finally  we must help georgia rebuild what has been destroyed  that is why i'm proud to join my friend  senator joe biden  in calling for an additional   billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia  these are the judgments i've made and the policies that we have to debate  because we do have differences in this election  but one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people can't disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism  i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition  i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve america's national interest  now  it's time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same  let me be clear  i will let no one question my love of this country  i love america  so do you  and so does john mccain  when i look out at this audience  i see people of different political views  you are democrats and republicans and independents  but you all served together  and fought together  and bled together under the same proud flag  you did not serve a red america or a blue america   you served the united states of america  so let's have a serious debate  and let's debate our disagreements on the merits of policy   not personal attacks  and no matter how heated it gets or what kind of campaign he chooses to run  i will honor senator mccain's service  just like i honor the service of every veteran in this room  and every american who has worn the uniform of the united states  one of those americans was my grandfather  stanley dunham  my father left when i was   so my grandfather was the man who helped raise me  he grew up in el dorado  kansas   a town too small to warrant boldface on a road map  he worked on oil rigs and drifted from town to town during the depression  then he met my grandmother and enlisted after pearl harbor  he would go on to march across europe in patton's army  while my great uncle fought with the  th infantry division to liberate buchenwald  my grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line  and my mother was born at fort leavenworth  after my grandfather left the army  he went to college on the gi bill  bought his home with help from the federal housing authority  and he and my grandmother moved west in a restless pursuit of their dreams  they were among the men and women of our greatest generation  they came from ordinary places  and went on to do extraordinary things  they survived a depression and faced down fascism  and when the guns fell silent  america stood by them  because they had a government that didn't just ask them to win a war   it helped them to live their dreams in peace  and to become the backbone of the largest middle class that the world has ever known  in the five years after world war ii  the gi bill helped   million veterans get an education  two million went to college  millions more learned a trade in factories or on farms  four million veterans received help in buying a home  leading to the biggest home construction boom in our history  and these veterans didn't just receive a hand from washington   they did their part to lift up america  just as they'd done their duty in defending it  they became teachers and doctors  cops and firefighters who were the foundation of our communities  they became the innovators and small business owners who helped drive the american economy  they became the scientists and engineers who helped us win the space race against the soviets  they won a cold war  and left a legacy to their children and grandchildren who reached new horizons of opportunity  i am a part of that legacy  without it  i would not be standing on this stage today  and as president  i will do everything that i can to keep the promise  to advance the american dream for all our veterans  and to enlist them in the cause of building a stronger america  our young men and women in uniform have proven that they are the equal of the greatest generation on the battlefield  now  we must ensure that our brave troops serving abroad today become the backbone of our middle class at home tomorrow  those who fight to defend america abroad must have the chance to live their dreams at home   through education and their ability to make a good living  through affordable health care  and through a retirement that is dignified and secure  that is the promise that we must keep with all who serve  it starts with those who choose to remain in uniform  as well as their families  my wife michelle has net with military families in north carolina  kentucky and virginia over the last several months  every time  she passes on their stories   stories of lives filled with patriotism and purpose  but also stories of spouses struggling to pay the bills  kids dealing with an absent parent  and the unique burden of multiple deployments  the message that michelle has heard is what you all know and have lived  when a loved one is deployed  the whole family goes to war  the vfw has done an extraordinary job of standing by our military families   helping out with everything from a phone card for a soldier who is overseas  to an extra hand around the house  as president  i will stand with you  we need a military families advisory board to identify new ways to ease the burden  we need more official support for the volunteer networks that help military spouses get by  and we need to make sure that military pay does not lag behind the private sector  so that those who serve can raise their families and live the life they've earned  for those who return to civilian life  i will support their american dream in this  st century just as we supported generations of veterans in the  th  that starts with education  everyone who serves this country should have the same opportunity that my grandfather had under the gi bill  that's why  unlike my opponent  i was a strong and early supporter of jim webb's gi bill for the  st century   a bill that senator mccain called too generous  at a time when the skyrocketing cost of tuition is pricing thousands of americans out of a college education  this bill provides every veteran with a real chance to afford a world class college education  and that's what i'll continue to stand up for as president  we must also stand up for affordable health care for every single veteran  that's why i've pledged to build a  st century va  we need to cut through the red tape   every service member should get electronic copies of medical and service records upon discharge  we need to close shortfalls   it's time to fully fund va health care  and to add more vet centers  we need to get rid of means testing   every veteran should be allowed into the va system  my opponent takes a different view  he wants to ration care so the va only serves combat injuries  while everyone else gets an insurance card  while the va needs some real reform to better serve those who have worn the uniform  privatization is just not the answer  we cannot risk our veterans' health care by turning the va into just another health insurer  we need to make sure the va is strong enough to treat every veteran who depends on it  that's what i'll do as president  and we must expand and enhance our ability to identify and treat ptsd and traumatic brain injury at all levels  from enlistment  to deployment  to civilian life  no one should suffer in silence  or slip through the cracks in the system  that's why i've passed measures to increase screening for these unseen wounds  and helped lead a bipartisan effort to stop the unfair practice of kicking out troops who suffer from them  this is something i've fought for in the senate  and it's something that i'll make a priority as president  economic security for our veterans also depends on revamping an overburdened benefits system  i congratulate the vfw for what you've done to help veterans navigate a broken vba bureaucracy  now it's time for the government to do a better job  we need more workers  and a  st century electronic system that is fully linked up to military records and the va's health network  it's time to ensure that those who've served get the benefits that they've earned  just as we give veterans the support they deserve  we must also engage them and all americans in a new cause  renewing america  i am running for president because i believe that there is no challenge too great for the american people to meet if they are called upon to come together  in america  each of us is free to seek our dreams  but we must also serve a common purpose  a higher purpose  no one embodies that commitment like a veteran  just think of the skills that our troops have developed through their service  they have not simply waged war in afghanistan and iraq   they have rebuilt infrastructure  supported new agriculture  trained police forces  and developed health care systems  for those leaving military service  it's time to apply those skills to our great national challenges here at home  that means expanding programs like troops to teachers that put veterans at the front of the classroom  that means tapping the talent of engineers who've served as we make a substantial investment to rebuild our infrastructure and create millions of new jobs  that means dramatically expanding national service programs to give americans of all ages  skills and stations the chance to give back to their communities and their country  i'll also enlist veterans in forging a new american energy economy  that's why i've proposed a green veterans initiative to give our veterans the training they need to succeed in the green jobs of the future   so that they put themselves on a pathway to a successful career  while ensuring that our national security is never held hostage to hostile nations  this is how we can help our veterans live their dreams while helping our country meet the challenges of the  st century  and this is what we have learned from so many generations of veterans  including those of you here today   that your contribution to the american story does not end when the uniform comes off  we need those who serve in our military to live their dreams   and to continue serving the cause of america   when the guns fall silent  that's what the vfw stands for  and if i have the honor of being your president  that's what my administration will work for every single day  because i believe that we have a sacred trust with those who serve in our military  that trust is simple  america will be there for you just as you have been there for america  it's a trust that begins at enlistment  and it never ends  i thought of that trust last week when i visited the pearl harbor memorial  i saw where the bombs fell on the uss arizona  and where a war began that would reshape the world order while reshaping the lives of all who served in it   from our great generals and admirals  to the enlisted men like my grandfather  then i visited his grave at the punchbowl  the national memorial cemetery of the pacific  i still remember the day that we laid my grandfather to rest  in a cemetery lined with the graves of americans who have sacrificed for our country  we heard the solemn notes of taps and the crack of guns fired in salute  we watched as a folded flag was handed to my grandmother and my grandfather was laid to rest  it was a nation's final act of service and gratitude to stanley dunham   an america that stood by my grandfather when he took off the uniform  and never left his side  this is what we owe our troops and our veterans  because in every note of taps and in every folded flag  we hear and see an unwavering belief in the idea of america  the idea that no matter where you come from  or what you look like  or who your parents are  this is a place where anything is possible  where anyone can make it  where we look out for each other  and take care of each other  where we rise and fall as one nation   as one people  it's an idea that's worth fighting for   an idea for which so many americans have given that last full measure of devotion  now it falls to us to advance that idea just as so many generations have before "], ["obama1", "nineteen months ago  on a cold february day right here on the steps of the old state capitol  i stood before you to announce my candidacy for president of the united states of america  we started this journey with a simple belief  that the american people were better than their government in washington   a government that has fallen prey to special interests and policies that have left working people behind  as i've travelled to towns and cities  farms and factories  front porches and fairgrounds in almost all fifty states   that belief has been strengthened  because at this defining moment in our history   with our nation at war  and our economy in recession   we know that the american people cannot afford four more years of the same failed policies and the same old politics in washington  we know that the time for change has come  for months  i've searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me  and to join in me in making washington work for the american people  i searched for a leader who understands the rising costs confronting working people  and who will always put their dreams first  a leader who sees clearly the challenges facing america in a changing world  with our security and standing set back by eight years of a failed foreign policy  a leader who shares my vision of an open government that calls all citizens   democrats  republicans and independents   to a common purpose  above all  i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president  today  i have come back to springfield to tell you that i've found that leader   a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency   joe biden  joe biden is that rare mix   for decades  he has brought change to washington  but washington hasn't changed him  he's an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class  he has stared down dictators and spoken out for america's cops and firefighters  he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track  now i could stand here and recite a list of senator biden's achievements  because he is one of the finest public servants of our time  but first i want to talk to you about the character of the man standing next to me  joe biden's many triumphs have only come after great trial  he was born in scranton  pennsylvania  his family didn't have much money  joe sr  worked different jobs  from cleaning boilers to selling cars  sometimes moving in with the in laws or working weekends to make ends meet  but he raised his family with a strong commitment to work and to family  to the catholic faith and to the belief that in america  you can make it if you try  those are the core values that joe biden has carried with him to this day  and even though joe sr  is not with us  i know that he is proud of joe today  it might be hard to believe when you hear him talk now  but as a child he had a terrible stutter  they called him  bu bu biden  but he picked himself up  worked harder than the other guy  and got elected to the senate   a young man with a family and a seemingly limitless future  then tragedy struck  joe's wife neilia and their little girl naomi were killed in a car accident  and their two boys were badly hurt  when joe was sworn in as a senator  there was no ceremony in the capitol   instead  he was standing by his sons in the hospital room where they were recovering  he was   years old  tragedy tests us   it tests our fortitude and it tests our faith  here's how joe biden responded  he never moved to washington  instead  night after night  week after week  year after year  he returned home to wilmington on a lonely amtrak train when his senate business was done  he raised his boys   first as a single dad  then alongside his wonderful wife jill  who works as a teacher  he had a beautiful daughter  now his children are grown and joe is blessed with  grandchildren  he instilled in them such a sense of public service that his son  beau  who is now delaware's attorney general  is getting ready to deploy to iraq  and he still takes that train back to wilmington every night  out of the heartbreak of that unspeakable accident  he did more than become a senator   he raised a family  that is the measure of the man standing next to me  that is the character of joe biden  years later  senator biden would face another brush with death when he had a brain aneurysm  on the way to the hospital  they didn't think he was going to make it  they gave him slim odds to recover  but he did  he beat it  and he came back stronger than before   maybe it's this resilience   this insistence on overcoming adversity   that accounts for joe biden's work in the senate  time and again  he has made a difference for the people across this country who work long hours and face long odds  this working class kid from scranton and wilmington has always been a friend to the underdog  and all who seek a safer and more prosperous america to live their dreams and raise their families  fifteen years ago  too many american communities were plagued by violence and insecurity  so joe biden brought democrats and republicans together to pass the   crime bill  putting   cops on the streets  and starting an eight year drop in crime across the country  for far too long  millions of women suffered abuse in the shadows  so joe biden wrote the violence against women act  so every woman would have a place to turn for support  the rate of domestic violence went down dramatically  and countless women got a second chance at life  year after year  he has been at the forefront of the fight for judges who respect the fundamental rights and liberties of the american people  college tuition that is affordable for all  equal pay for women and a rising minimum wage for all  and family leave policies that value work and family  those are the priorities of a man whose work reflects his life and his values  that same strength of character is at the core of his rise to become one of america's leading voices on national security  he looked slobodan milosevic in the eye and called him a war criminal  and then helped shape policies that would end the killing in the balkans and bring him to justice  he passed laws to lock down chemical weapons  and led the push to bring europe's newest democracies into nato  over the last eight years  he has been a powerful critic of the catastrophic bush mccain foreign policy  and a voice for a new direction that takes the fight to the terrorists and ends the war in iraq responsibly  he recently went to georgia  where he met quietly with the president and came back with a call for aid and a tough message for russia  joe biden is what so many others pretend to be   a statesman with sound judgment who doesn't have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong  joe won't just make a good vice president   he will make a great one  after decades of steady work across the aisle  i know he'll be able to help me turn the page on the ugly partisanship in washington  so we can bring democrats and republicans together to pass an agenda that works for the american people  and instead of secret task energy task forces stacked with big oil and a vice president that twists the facts and shuts the american people out  i know that joe biden will give us some real straight talk  i have seen this man work  i have sat with him as he chairs the senate foreign relations committee  and been by his side on the campaign trail  and i can tell you that joe biden gets it  he's that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol  in the vfw hall in concord  and at the center of an international crisis  that's because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds  the dedicated family man and committed catholic who knows every conductor on that amtrak train to wilmington  that's the kind of fighter who i want by my side in the months and years to come  that's what it's going to take to win the fight for good jobs that let people live their dreams  a tax code that rewards work instead of wealth  and health care that is affordable and accessible for every american family  that's what it's going to take to forge a new energy policy that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil and   gasoline at the pump  while creating new jobs and new industry  that's what it's going to take to put an end to a failed foreign policy that's based on bluster and bad judgment  so that we renew america's security and standing in the world  we know what we're going to get from the other side  four more years of the same out of touch policies that created an economic disaster at home  and a disastrous foreign policy abroad  four more years of the same divisive politics that is all about tearing people down instead of lifting this country up  we can't afford more of the same  i am running for president because that's a future that i don't accept for my daughters and i don't accept it for your children  it's time for the change that the american people need  now  with joe biden at my side  i am confident that we can take this country in a new direction  that we are ready to overcome the adversity of the last eight years  that we won't just win this election in november  we'll restore that fair shot at your dreams that is at the core of who joe biden and i are as people  and what america is as a nation  so let me introduce you to the next vice president of the united states of america "], ["obama1", "yesterday was a special day around my house  it was back to school day for my girls  sasha started second grade and malia began  th  i know malia was really embarrassed when i walked her to the classroom  but i did it anyway because she's still daddy's girl  and seeing them back at school was a reminder not only that another year had passed and that they're growing up a little faster than i'd sometimes like  it was also a reminder of all the other parents who are dropping their children off at school  and all the other kids who are getting ready for another year of classes  every four years  we hear candidates talk about the vital importance of education  about how improving our schools is key to the future of our children and the future of our country  every four years  we hear about how this time  we're going to make it an urgent national priority  remember the   election  when george w  bush promised to be the  education president  but just as with energy independence and health care  the urgency of upgrading public education for the  st century has been talked to death in washington  and that failure to act has put our nation in jeopardy  well  the day of reckoning is here  our kids and our country can't afford four more years of neglect and indifference  at this defining moment in our history  america faces few more urgent challenges than preparing our children to compete in a global economy  the decisions our leaders make about education in the coming years will shape our future for generations to come  they will help determine not only whether our children have the chance to fulfill their god given potential  or whether our workers have the chance to build a better life for their families  but whether we  as a nation  will remain in the  st century the kind of global economic leader that we were in the  th century  the rising importance of education reflects the new demands of our new world  in recent decades  revolutions in communications and information technology have broken down barriers that once kept countries and markets apart  creating a single  global economy that is more integrated and interconnected than ever before  in this economy  companies can plant their jobs wherever there's an internet connection and someone willing to do the work  meaning that children here in dayton are growing up competing with children not only in detroit  but in delhi as well  what matters  then  isn't what you do or where you live  but what you know  when two thirds of all new jobs require a higher education or advanced training  knowledge is the most valuable skill you can sell  it's not only a pathway to opportunity  but a prerequisite  without a good pre school education  our children are less likely to keep up with their peers  without a high school diploma  you're likely to make about three times less than a college graduate  and without a college degree or industry certification  it's harder and harder to find a job that can help you support your family and keep up with rising costs  but it's not just that a world class education is essential for workers to compete and win  it's that an educated workforce is essential for america to compete and win  without a workforce trained in math  science  and technology and the other skills of the  st century  our companies will innovate less  our economy will grow less  and our nation will be less competitive  if we want to outcompete the world tomorrow  we must out educate the world today  if we want to keep building the cars of the future here in america  we can't afford to see the number of phds in engineering climbing in china  south korea  and japan even as it's dropped here in america  we can't afford a future where our high school students rank near the bottom in math and science  and our high school drop out rate is one of the highest in the industrialized world  if we want to build a  st century infrastructure and repair our crumbling roads and bridges  we can't afford a future where a third of all  th graders and a fifth of all  th graders can't do basic math  and black and latino students are even further behind  where elementary school kids are only getting an average   minutes of science each day when over   of the fastest growing jobs require some knowledge in math and science  if we want to see middle class incomes rising like they did in the  's  we can't afford a future where so many americans are priced out of college  where only   percent of our students are prepared to take college level english  math  and science  where millions of jobs are going unfilled because americans don't have the skills to work them  and where barely one in ten low income students will ever get their college degree  that kind of future is economically untenable for america  it is morally unacceptable for our children  and it is not who we are as a nation  we are a nation that has always renewed our system of education to meet the challenges of a new time  lincoln created the land grant colleges to ensure the success of the union he was fighting to save  generations of leaders built mandatory public schools to prepare our children for the changing needs of our nation  and eisenhower doubled federal investment in education after the soviets beat us to space  that is the kind of leadership we must show today  but that's not the leadership we've been getting from washington  for decades  they've been stuck in the same tired debates over education that have crippled our progress and left schools and parents to fend for themselves  it's been democrat versus republican  vouchers versus the status quo  more money versus more reform  there's partisanship and there's bickering  but there's no understanding that both sides have good ideas that we'll need to implement if we hope to make the changes our children need  and we've fallen further and further behind as a result  if we're going to make a real and lasting difference for our future  we have to be willing to move beyond the old arguments of left and right and take meaningful  practical steps to build an education system worthy of our children and our future  in the past few weeks  my opponent has taken to talking about the need for change and reform in washington  where he has been part of the scene for about three decades  and in those three decades  he has not done one thing to truly improve the quality of public education in our country  not one real proposal or law or initiative  nothing  instead  he marched with the ideologues in his party in opposing efforts to hire more teachers  and expand head start  and make college more affordable  you don't reform our schools by opposing efforts to fully fund no child left behind  and you certainly don't reform our education system by calling to close the department of education  that would just make it harder for us to give out financial aid  harder for us to keep track of how our schools are doing  and lead to widening inequality in who gets a college degree  that is not my idea of reform  that is not my idea of change  that is not a plan to help your kids compete with those kids in china and india  after three decades of indifference on education  do you really believe that john mccain is going to make a difference now  john mccain doesn't get it  he doesn't understand that our success as a nation depends on our success in education  i do  that's why last november  i proposed an education agenda that moves beyond party and ideology and focuses instead on what will make the most difference in a child's life  my plan calls for giving every child a world class education from the day they're born until the day they graduate from college  it's a plan that starts with investing in early childhood education because we know that children in these programs are more likely to score higher in reading and math  more likely to graduate high school and attend college  more likely to hold a job and earn more in that job  and it's a plan that will finally put a college degree within reach for anyone who wants one by providing a   tax credit to any middle class student who's willing to serve their community or their country  of course  we also have to fix the broken promises of no child left behind  now  i believe that the goals of this law were the right ones  making a promise to educate every child with an excellent teacher is right  closing the achievement gap that exists in too many cities and rural areas is right  more accountability is right  higher standards are right  but i'll tell you what's wrong with no child left behind  forcing our teachers  our principals  and our schools to accomplish all of this without the resources they need is wrong  promising high quality teachers in every classroom and then leaving the support and the pay for those teachers behind is wrong  labeling a school and its students as failures one day and then throwing your hands up and walking away from them the next is wrong  and by the way   don't tell us that the only way to teach a child is to spend most of the year preparing him to fill in a few bubbles on a standardized test  let's finally help our teachers and principals develop a curriculum and assessments that teach our kids to become more than just good test takers  we need assessments that can improve achievement by including the kinds of research  scientific investigation  and problem solving that our children will need to compete in a  st century knowledge economy  we must fix the failures of no child left behind  we must provide the funding we were promised  and give our states the resources they need  and finally meet our commitment to special education  but democrats have to realize that fixing no child left behind is not enough to prepare our children for a global economy  we need a new vision for a  st century education   one where we aren't just supporting existing schools  but spurring innovation  where we're not just investing more money  but demanding more reform  where parents take responsibility for their children's success  where our schools and government are accountable for results  where we're recruiting  retaining  and rewarding an army of new teachers  and students are excited to learn because they're attending schools of the future  and where we expect all our children not only to graduate high school  but to graduate college and get a good paying job  it's time to ask ourselves why other countries are outperforming us in education  because it's not that their kids are smarter than ours   it's that they're being smarter about how to educate their kids  they're spending less time teaching things that don't matter and more time teaching things that do  their students are spending more time in school  and they're setting higher expectations  that's what we need to be doing   because america isn't a country that accepts second place  when i'm president  we'll fight to make sure we're once again first in the world when it comes to high school graduation rates  we'll push our kids to study harder and aim higher  i've worked with republican senator jim demint on a bill that would challenge high school students to take college level courses   and make sure low income neighborhoods and rural communities have access to those courses  and i'll make it the law of the land when i'm president  and we'll also set a goal of increasing the number of high school students taking college level or ap courses by   percent in the coming years  because i believe that when we challenge our kids to succeed  they will  a while back  i was talking with my friend arne duncan  who runs the chicago public schools  he was explaining how he'd managed to increase the number of kids taking and passing ap courses in chicago over the last few years  what he said was  our kids aren't smarter than they were three years ago  our expectations for them are just higher  well  i think it's time we raised expectations for our kids all across this country  and that's what we'll do when i'm president of the united states  the second thing we need to do is make sure that we're preparing our kids for the  st century economy by bringing our school system into the  st century  part of what that means is fostering the kinds of schools that will help prepare our kids  which is why i'm calling for the creation of an innovative schools fund  this fund will invest in schools like the austin polytechnical academy  which is located in a part of chicago that's been hard hit by the decline in manufacturing over the past few decades  thanks to partnerships with a number of companies  a curriculum that prepares students for a career in engineering  and a requirement that students graduate with at least two industry certifications  austin polytech is bringing hope back to the community  and that's the kind of model we'll replicate across the country when i'm president of the united states  giving our parents real choices about where to send their kids to school also means showing the same kind of leadership at the national level that i did in illinois when i passed a law to double the number of charter schools in chicago  that is why as president  i'll double the funding for responsible charter schools  now  i know you've had a tough time with for profit charter schools here in ohio  that is why i'll work with governor strickland to hold for profit charter schools accountable  and i'll work with all our nation's governors to hold all our charter schools accountable  charter schools that are successful will get the support they need to grow  and charters that aren't will get shut down  and we'll help ensure that more of our kids have access to quality afterschool and summer school and extended school days for students who need it   because if they can do that in china  we can do that right here in the united states of america  as we bring our school system into the  st century  we also have to bring our schools into the  st century  because while technology has transformed just about every aspect of our lives   from the way we travel to the way we communicate to the way we look after our health   one of the places where we've failed to seize its full potential is in the classroom  imagine a future where our children are more motivated because they aren't just learning on blackboards but on new whiteboards with digital touch screens  where every student in a classroom has a laptop at their desk  where they don't just do book reports but design powerpoint presentations  where they don't just write papers but build websites  where research isn't done just by taking a book out of the library but by emailing experts in the field  and where teachers are less a source of knowledge than a coach for how best to use it  by fostering innovation  we can help make sure every school in america is a school of the future  that's what we'll do when i'm president  we'll help schools integrate technology into their curriculum so we can make sure public school students are fluent in the digital language of the  st century economy  we'll teach our students not only math and science  but teamwork  and critical thinking and communication skills   because that's how we'll make sure they're prepared for today's workplace  but no matter how many choices we're giving our parents or how much technology we're using in our schools or how tough our classes are  none of it will make much difference if we don't also recruit  prepare  and retain outstanding teachers  because from the moment a child enters a school  the most important factor in their success is the person standing at the front of the classroom  that's why last year  i proposed a new service scholarship program that will recruit top talent into the profession  and place these new teachers in overcrowded districts and struggling rural towns  or hard to staff subjects like special education in schools across the nation  to prepare these new teachers  i'll create more teacher residency programs that will build on a law i recently passed and train   high quality teachers a year  especially in math and science  to support our teachers  we'll expand mentoring programs that pair experienced  successful teachers with new recruits  and when our teachers succeed in making a real difference in our children's lives  we should reward them for it by finding new ways to increase teacher pay that are developed with teachers  not imposed on them  we can do this  from prince george's county in maryland to denver  colorado  we're seeing teachers and school boards coming together to design performance pay plans  so yes  we must give teachers every tool they need to be successful  but we also need to give every child the assurance that they'll have the teacher they need to be successful  that means setting a firm standard   teachers who are doing a poor job will get extra support  but if they still don't improve  they'll be replaced  because as good teachers are the first to tell you  if we're going to attract the best teachers to the profession  we can't settle for schools filled with poor teachers  now  i know this sounds like a lot  but we can do it all   we can increase the number of students taking college level courses  expand innovation and school choice  invest in the schools of tomorrow  and put a quality teacher in every classroom   all for the cost of just a few days in iraq  and we'll pay for that cost by carefully winding down the war in iraq  by ending no bid contracts  and by eliminating wasteful spending  so we'll make these investments  but we'll do it without mortgaging our children's future on an even larger amount of debt  we'll do it responsibly  this leads me to my final point   as president  i will lead a new era of accountability in education  but i don't just want to hold our teachers accountable  i want you to hold our government accountable  i want you to hold me accountable  that's why every year i'm president  i will report back to you on the progress our schools are making  because it's time to stop passing the buck on education  and start accepting responsibility  and that's the kind of example i'll set as president of the united states  accountability in washington starts by making sure that every tax dollar spent by the department of education is being spent wisely  when i'm president  programs that work will get more money  programs that don't will get less  and we'll send a team to fix bad programs by replacing bad managers  because your tax dollars should only be funding programs and grants that actually make a difference in a child's education  but in the end  responsibility for our children's success doesn't start in washington  it starts in our homes  it starts in our families  because no education policy can replace a parent who's involved in their child's education from day one  who makes sure their children are in school on time  helps them with their homework after dinner  and attends those parent teacher conferences  no government program can turn off the tv  or put away the video games  or read to your children  but we can help parents do a better job  that's why i'll create a parent report card that will show you whether your kid is on the path to college  we'll help schools post student progress reports online so you can get a regular update on what kind of grades your child is getting on tests and quizzes from week to week  if your kid is falling behind  or playing hooky  or isn't on track to go to college or compete for that good paying job  it will be up to you to do something about it  so yes  we need to hold our government accountable  yes  we have to hold our schools accountable  but we also have to hold ourselves accountable  you know  when i dropped my daughters off at school yesterday  i couldn't help but think about all america had done over the years to give me and my family a good education  this is a country that put my grandfather through college on the gi bill after he left patton's army  this is a country that drew my father   like so many immigrants   across an ocean in search of a college degree  and this is a country that let the child of a teenage mom and an absent father reach for his dreams  you see  i wasn't born with a lot of advantages  but i was given love  and support  and an education that put me on a pathway to success  the same was true for michelle  she came from a blue collar family on the south side of chicago  even though her father had multiple sclerosis  he went to work every day at the local water filtration plant to support his family  and michelle and her brother were able to go to a great college  and reach a little further for their dreams  so i know that the only reason michelle and i are where we are today is because this country we love gave us the chance at an education  and the reason i'm running for president is to give every single american that same chance  to give the young sisters out there born with a gift for invention the chance to become the next orville and wilbur wright  to give the young boy out there who wants to create a life saving cure the chance to become the next jonas salk  and to give the child out there whose imagination has been sparked by the wonders of the internet the chance to become the next bill gates  our future depends on it  when the story of our time is told  i don't want it to be said that china seized this moment to reform its education system  but the united states did not  i don't want it to be said that india led the way on innovation  but the united states did not  i want it to be said that we rose to meet this challenge  and educated our people to become the most highly skilled workers in the world   just like we always have been  because i know that if we can just bring our education system into the  st century  not only will our children be able to fulfill their god given potential  and our families be able to live out their dreams  not only will our schools out educate the world and our workers outcompete the world  not only will our companies innovate more and our economy grow more  but at this defining moment  we will do what previous generations of americans have done   and unleash the promise of our people  unlock the promise of our country  and make sure that america remains a beacon of opportunity and prosperity for all the world  thank you "], ["obama1", "it's an honor to be here with all of you tonight  and i've got to tell you  looking around this room  i'm reminded of the story congresswoman roybal allard tells about the chc's first meeting three decades ago  back then  her father  congressman edward roybal  approached the speaker of the house  tip o'neill  to ask for a room for the meeting  o'neill responded with his signature humor   by asking if a telephone booth would do  because there were so few members  well  i don't think congressman roybal could have imagined that meeting would one day give rise to a gathering like this  and to an organization that's training the next generation of hispanic leaders all across america   helping young people graduate from high school  and attend college  and become leaders in their fields  i come here tonight as the first african american nominee of the democratic party because generations before me did that same work to break barriers and open doors  and i hope that because of the work all of you are doing  somewhere in this audience sits the person who will become the first hispanic president of the united states  the work of this organization reflects the character of the hispanic community in which so many people have come here with so little   but had big dreams  big hearts  and a willingness to struggle and sacrifice so the next generation doesn't have to  it's the same reason my own father came here from kenya so many years ago   because he believed that america was a place where you can make it if you try  today  that fundamental american promise is at risk  our nation is at war and our economy is in turmoil  more americans are out of work  and have mortgages they can't pay  and cars they can't afford to drive  and wonder how they'll ever afford to retire  and we've all seen the statistics   we all know the hispanic community has been especially hard hit  now  we didn't get here by accident  the challenges we face are   at least in part   the direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of the folks in the white house these last two terms  and last week  we watched as the same party responsible for the past eight years asked this country for another four  now  i'm happy to see that in the past few days  senator mccain has finally realized what we've known all along   that the american people are hungry for change  and he's finally ready to have a debate about who can deliver that change  well  that's a debate i'm eager to have  because the truth is  on the issues that matter most in people's lives  senator mccain is offering nothing but four years more of the same  senator mccain has worn our country's uniform with bravery and distinction  and for that  we owe him our gratitude and respect  but we also owe ourselves a close look at his record and his agenda for america  he voted with george bush ninety percent of the time   and while in recent days  he's railed against washington lobbyists  he's neglected to mention that his campaign is run by washington lobbyists  he said that our economy has made  great progress  under president bush  and offers the same old philosophy that's failed us for decades  give more to those with the most and hope prosperity trickles down to everyone else  so there are many words to describe senator mccain's agenda   but change isn't one of them  it's the same old politics and the same old policies that haven't worked for the past eight years and won't work now  and it's time for something new  we know that government can't solve all our problems   and it shouldn't try  but it should work for us  not against us  it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence  but for every american willing to work  that's what this election is about  this election is about the families   including so many latino families   who are losing their homes and their jobs  and working jobs that pay less and come with fewer benefits  they need us to solve this housing crisis  and end these tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas  and give real tax relief to middle class families  that's what i'll do as president  this election is about the latino students who attend overflowing classes in underfunded schools and are dropping out of school faster than nearly anyone else  they're counting on us to stop leaving the money behind for no child left behind  to recruit an army of new teachers  and make college affordable for anyone who wants to go  that's what i'll do as president  this election is about the   million americans who don't have health care   one in three hispanics   and about the small business owners who can barely stay afloat because of rising health care costs  they're counting on us to guarantee health care for anyone who needs it and make it affordable for anyone who wants it  that's what i'll do as president  this election is about the veterans   including so many from this community   who serve this country so bravely  but come home to new battles to get the benefits they've earned  they're counting on us to build a  st century va  and pass a  st century gi bill of rights  and provide good health care  including mental health care  that's what i'll do as president  this election is about the   million people living in the shadows  the communities taking immigration enforcement into their own hands they're counting on us to stop the hateful rhetoric filling our airwaves  rise above the fear and demagoguery  and finally enact comprehensive immigration reform  now  i know senator mccain used to buck his party by fighting for comprehensive reform   and i admired him for it  but when he was running for his party's nomination  he abandoned his stance  and said he wouldn't even support his own legislation if it came up for a vote  and when it came time to write his party's platform  comprehensive reform never made it in  so you've got to ask yourself  if senator mccain won't stand up to opponents of reform at his own convention  how can you trust him to stand up for change in washington  well  i don't know about you  but i think it's time for a president who won't walk away from comprehensive immigration reform when it becomes politically unpopular  that's the commitment we made in our democratic party platform  that's why i was proud to champion the comprehensive immigration reform act  that's why i was proud to stand with you in those marches for immigration reform  and that's the kind of partner i'll be in the white house  now  those   million people broke the law  and we cannot excuse that  but we cannot deport   million people  instead  we'll require them to pay a fine  learn english  and go to the back of the line for citizenship   behind those who came here legally  at the same time  we'll secure our borders and crack down on employers who hire undocumented workers  that's how we'll reconcile our values as both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws  making this kind of change won't be easy  but it's what so many of you are doing in our communities every day  it's how i started my career  working with community leaders   black  brown and white   on the south side of chicago  helping families devastated when the steel mills closed down and the jobs dried up  so i've got to tell you  i was pretty surprised when i heard our opponents making fun of that work last week at their convention   mocking what so many americans do every day in church groups and unions and the pta to serve struggling communities  frankly  i don't think it's particularly funny that people are losing their jobs and their homes  i don't think that failing schools and crumbling neighborhoods are something to laugh about  and i've got news for john mccain  coming together to give back to our communities  that's how a lot of us   democrats  republicans and independents   that's how we put our country first  that's why i'm running for president  but i can't do this alone  so i'm here tonight to ask for your help  some of the closest contests this november will be in states like florida  colorado  nevada and new mexico   states with large latino populations  and latino voters will play a critical role all across this country  and if you have any doubt about whether you can make a difference  just remember how  back in     registered latino voters in new mexico didn't turn out on election day  senator kerry lost that state by fewer than   votes    votes  today  in   an estimated   latinos in new mexico aren't registered to vote  so i'm not taking a single hispanic vote for granted in this campaign  we're meeting with latino leaders and reaching out to latino organizations to get input on my policy proposals  we've got a nationwide hispanic media strategy  and we're holding latino voter registration drives across america  and when i'm president  i'll be asking many of you to serve at every level of government  in the end  though  what's at stake in this election is far bigger than any one party or platform or candidate  we all know that  it's what we learned in the hardest way possible on that september day  seven years ago tomorrow  when in the face of unthinkable tragedy  we came together   black and white  latino and asian  from every region and religion and walk of life  those losses were all our losses   that suffering was all our suffering  and at that darkest moment  we understood that here in america  we all have a stake in each other  i am my brother's keeper  i am my sister's keeper  and we rise and fall as one nation  it's the very idea that brought five members of congress together three decades ago to found the congressional hispanic caucus  and it's what's brought us here tonight   the belief that america should be a nation where we pursue our individual dreams  but still come together  as one american family  to ensure the next generation can pursue their dreams too  it's time that our politics reflected that understanding  it's time that we turned the page on the failed policies of the past and brought new energy and ideas to the challenges we face  and if you're willing to work with me  and fight with me  and stand with me this fall   together  we won't just win an election  we will transform this nation  thank you  god bless you  and god bless america "], ["obama1", "it's great to be back in dover  we made our first stop in new hampshire over   months ago  and a lot has changed  there are babies walking and talking today who weren't even born back then  but there's one thing that hasn't changed in those   months  the american people know this country is on the wrong track  and you know that we need new leadership in washington  the good news is that in   days  the name george bush will not be on the ballot  but make no mistake  his policies will  a few weeks ago  john mccain said that the economy is  fundamentally strong  and a few days later george bush said the same thing  in fact  senator mccain has said that we made  great progress economically  over the last eight years  and here's the thing  i think they truly believe it  after all  my opponent said just last night   it's easy for me to go to washington and frankly  be somewhat divorced from the day to day challenges people have  so from where he and george bush sit  maybe they just can't see  maybe they are just that out of touch  but you know the truth  and so do i  for eight years  we've failed to keep that american promise that if you work hard you can live your american dream  under the bush economic policies that my opponent supported and promises to continue  the average family has seen their income drop by  a year  while the cost of everything from gas to groceries has gone up  we have the highest unemployment rate in five years  home values have plummeted  it's harder to save and it's harder to retire  those are the day to day challenges that people have  we can't afford four more years of this so called  progress  we can't afford another president who is so out of touch that he thinks the economy is strong and that change is doing the exact same thing as george bush  that's what senator mccain is offering  more of the discredited theory that if you shower benefits on big corporations  special interests and the wealthiest of the wealthy  it will all come trickling down to the middle class  well  dover  how much of that has trickled down to you  how much has trickled down to the americans who have lost their jobs and their homes  how much has trickled down to the family that can't afford to pay next month's bills or the kids who can't afford college  we've tried this for eight years  and we can't afford to keep trying it for another four  we can't afford to keep spending   billion a month in iraq while the iraqi government sits on a surplus  we can't afford more of the same addiction to oil  more of the same health care policy that only works for the healthy and wealthy  more of the same washington lobbyists who run john mccain's campaign  more of the same bush rove mccain politics that tries to distract you from policies that are destroying the middle class  we've tried that way  it won't work  and yet senator mccain stubbornly holds to it  the only change he offers is completing the bush agenda  privatizing your social security  taxing your health benefits  and another   billion of budget busting tax breaks for corporations like exxon mobil that have just turned in the greatest profits in history  while you can barely afford to fill up a tank of gas  it's time for us to say  enough is enough  now my opponent wants to have a debate about change  and that's a debate that i welcome  because the choice in this election is very simple  if you are better off than you were eight years ago and you want four more years of a president who puts the special interests and the biggest corporations first  then vote for john mccain  if you believe it's time for fundamental change in washington and a president who puts the middle class first  then we will win this election in november  and we will change this country for our children and our grandchildren  that's the choice in this election  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  it's time for change  and let me tell you exactly what that change will look like  change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it  but the american workers and seniors and small businesses who deserve it  take a close look at the tax cuts i'm proposing and the special interest giveaways that my opponent is proposing  because that will tell you everything you need to know about who we're going to put first as president  i will cut taxes   cut taxes   for   percent of all working americans  i will reward work through a  making work pay  tax credit of   for american workers and   for working families  because when i'm president  we'll rewrite the tax code to work for the middle class   not washington lobbyists  that's change  i will ease the burden on struggling homeowners through a universal homeowner's tax credit  this will add up to a   percent break off the mortgage interest rate for   million households  that's another   each year for most middle class families  that's change  i will make sure our seniors can afford to retire with the dignity and security they have earned  that's why i will eliminate income taxes for seniors making less than   this will end income taxes for   million americans  at a savings of roughly   each year  that's change  i will make college affordable for every single american who has the talent and drive to go with an annual   tax credit for anyone who commits to   hours of public service  you invest in america  and america invests in you that's how we'll make college affordable for every american  that's change  i think we need to encourage growth  senator mccain thinks we need to give   billion a year in tax breaks for corporations  but not a single new tax break for small businesses   even though small businesses are the source of   percent of the new jobs in our economy  i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and start ups that will create the high tech  high wage jobs of tomorrow  and help them afford health insurance for their employees  that's how america is going to compete  that's how we're going to build the middle class  that's change  we need a tax code that creates american jobs instead of shipping them overseas  you know  just this week we learned that if an american company creates jobs in the united states  they pay more than twice as much in taxes than if that same company creates jobs in china  so you pay more than twice as much to create jobs in dover than shanghai  that's a direct result of what we've gotten from washington year after year after year  and it's time for that to change  my opponent has voted for those tax breaks  and he'll continue them as president  i will end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas  and start investing in american jobs and workers  to pay for these tax cuts  i'll stand up to special interest carve outs  close corporate loopholes and offshore tax havens  and ask the wealthiest americans to give back a portion of the bush tax cuts  it's time for folks like me who make over   to pay our fair share to keep the american promise alive for our children and grandchildren  when you're running for four more years of george bush's policies  it's hard to run on your plans  so you make stuff up  you twist facts  and you don't tell the truth   that's what john mccain has done when it comes to my tax plan  so let's be clear about what we are proposing  my plan   all together   is a net tax cut  my plan will cut taxes to a smaller share of the economy than they were under president reagan  under my plan  income taxes for typical american families will be the lowest that they've been in more than a half century  everyone in america   everyone   will pay lower taxes than they would under the rates bill clinton had in the  s  and under my plan  middle class families will get three times as much relief as senator mccain is offering  in fact  his plan gives absolutely nothing to over   million american households  and i can make a firm pledge  under my plan  no family making less than   will see their taxes increase   not your income taxes  not your payroll taxes  not your capital gains taxes  not any of your taxes  my opponent can't make that pledge  and here's why  for the first time in american history  he wants to tax your health benefits apparently  senator mccain doesn't think it's enough that your health premiums have doubled  he thinks you should have to pay taxes on them too  that's a   trillion tax increase on middle class families  that will eventually leave tens of millions of you paying higher taxes  that's his idea of change  now i do want to be fair  senator mccain is offering some tax cuts  he'd spend nearly   trillion over a decade in tax breaks for corporations  he would continue the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  his plan gives more than a half million dollars in tax cuts for households making over   million  that's right     million  now i know that senator mccain has said that only those making over   million a year are rich  so maybe he thinks that folks making   million are middle class  we cannot afford four more years of out of touch  on your own  leadership in the white house  john mccain likes to rail against the washington herd  but the truth is  when it comes to the issues that really matter in your lives  he's been running in that herd for   years  and they've run this economy into a ditch  this election is our chance to stand up and say   enough is enough  it won't be easy  the kind of change we're looking for never is  what we are up against is a very powerful  entrenched status quo in washington who will say anything and do anything and fight with everything they've got to keep things just the way are  but i feel good about our chances  because i've got something more powerful than they do  i've got you  in this campaign  you have already shown what history teaches us   that at defining moments like this one  the change we need doesn't come from washington  change comes to washington this election is our chance to choose an economy that rewards your work and advances your dreams  but i need your help  i ask you to knock on some doors  and make some calls  and talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will change america together  thank you "], ["obama1", "over the last few days  we have seen clearly what's at stake in this election  the news from wall street has shaken the american people's faith in our economy  the situation with lehman brothers and other financial institutions is the latest in a wave of crises that have generated tremendous uncertainty about the future of our financial markets  this is a major threat to our economy and its ability to create good paying jobs and help working americans pay their bills  save for their future  and make their mortgage payments  since this turmoil began over a year ago  the housing market has collapsed  fannie mae and freddie mac had to be effectively taken over by the government  three of america's five largest investment banks failed or have been sold off in distress  yesterday  wall street suffered its worst losses since just after   we are in the most serious financial crisis in generations  yet senator mccain stood up yesterday and said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong a few hours later  his campaign sent him back out to clean up his remarks  and he tried to explain himself again this morning by saying that what he meant was that american workers are strong  but we know that senator mccain meant what he said the first time  because he has said it over and over again throughout this campaign   no fewer than   times  according to one independent count  now i certainly don't fault senator mccain for all of the problems we're facing  but i do fault the economic philosophy he subscribes to  because the truth is  what senator mccain said yesterday fits with the same economic philosophy that he's had for   years  it's the philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down  it's the philosophy that says even common sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise  it's a philosophy that lets washington lobbyists shred consumer protections and distort our economy so it works for the special interests instead of working people  we've had this philosophy for eight years  we know the results  you feel it in your own lives  jobs have disappeared  and peoples' life savings have been put at risk  millions of families face foreclosure  and millions more have seen their home values plummet  the cost of everything from gas to groceries to health care has gone up  while the dream of a college education for our kids and a secure and dignified retirement for our seniors is slipping away  these are the struggles that americans are facing  this is the pain that has now trickled up  so let's be clear  what we've seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed  and i am running for president of the united states because the dreams of the american people must not be endangered any more  it's time to put an end to a broken system in washington that is breaking the american economy  it's time for change that makes a real difference in your lives  if you want to understand the difference between how senator mccain and i would govern as president  you can start by taking a look at how we've responded to this crisis  because senator mccain's approach was the same as the bush administration's  support ideological policies that made the crisis more likely  do nothing as the crisis hits  and then scramble as the whole thing collapses  my approach has been to try to prevent this turmoil  in february of   i introduced legislation to stop mortgage transactions that promoted fraud  risk or abuse  a year later  before the crisis hit  i warned secretary paulson and chairman bernanke about the risks of mounting foreclosures and urged them to bring together all the stakeholders to find solutions to the subprime mortgage meltdown  senator mccain did nothing  last september  i stood up at nasdaq and said it's time to realize that we are in this together   that there is no dividing line between wall street and main street   and warned of a growing loss of trust in our capital markets  months later  senator mccain told a newspaper that he'd love to give them a solution to the mortgage crisis   but    he said    i don't know one  in january  i outlined a plan to help revive our faltering economy  which formed the basis for a bipartisan stimulus package that passed the congress  senator mccain used the crisis as an excuse to push a so called stimulus plan that offered another huge and permanent corporate tax cut  including   billion for the big oil companies  but no immediate help for workers  this march  in the wake of the bear stearns bailout  i called for a new   st century regulatory framework to restore accountability  transparency  and trust in our financial markets  just a few weeks earlier  senator mccain made it clear where he stands   i'm always for less regulation  he said  and referred to himself as  fundamentally a deregulator  this is what happens when you confuse the free market with a free license to let special interests take whatever they can get  however they can get it  this is what happens when you see seven years of incomes falling for the average worker while wall street is booming  and declare   as senator mccain did earlier this year   that we've made great progress economically under george bush  that is how you can reach the conclusion   as late as yesterday   that the fundamentals of the economy are strong  well  we have a different way of measuring the fundamentals of our economy  we know that the fundamentals that we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great  that america is a place where you can make it if you try  americans have always pursued our dreams within a free market that has been the engine of our progress  it's a market that has created a prosperity that is the envy of the world  and rewarded the innovators and risk takers who have made america a beacon of science  and technology  and discovery  but the american economy has worked in large part because we have guided the market's invisible hand with a higher principle   that america prospers when all americans can prosper  that is why we have put in place rules of the road to make competition fair  and open  and honest  too often  over the last quarter century  we have lost this sense of shared prosperity  and this has not happened by accident  it's because of decisions made in boardrooms  on trading floors and in washington  we failed to guard against practices that all too often rewarded financial manipulation instead of productivity and sound business practices  we let the special interests put their thumbs on the economic scales  the result has been a distorted market that creates bubbles instead of steady  sustainable growth  a market that favors wall street over main street  but ends up hurting both  let me be clear  the american economy does not stand still  and neither should the rules that govern it  the evolution of industries often warrants regulatory reform   to foster competition  lower prices  or replace outdated oversight structures  old institutions cannot adequately oversee new practices  old rules may not fit the roads where our economy is leading  but instead of sensible reform that rewarded success and freed the creative forces of the market  too often we've excused an ethic of greed  corner cutting and inside dealing that threatens the long term stability of our economic system  it happened in the  s  when we loosened restrictions on savings and loans and appointed regulators who ignored even these weaker rules  too many s amp ls  took advantage of the lax rules set by washington to gamble that they could make big money in speculative real estate  confident of their clout in washington  they made hundreds of billions in bad loans  knowing that if they lost money  the government would bail them out  and they were right  the gambles did not pay off  our economy went into recession  and the taxpayers ended up footing the bill  sound familiar  and it has happened again during this decade  in part because of how we deregulated the financial services sector  after we repealed outmoded rules instead of updating them  we were left overseeing  st century innovation with  th century regulations  when subprime mortgage lending took a reckless and unsustainable turn  a patchwork of regulators systematically and deliberately eliminated the regulations protecting the american people and failed to raise warning flags that could have protected investors and the pensions american workers count on  this was not the invisible hand of the market at work  these cycles of bubble and bust were symptoms of the ideology that my opponent is running to continue  john mccain has spent decades in washington supporting financial institutions instead of their customers  in fact  one of the biggest proponents of deregulation in the financial sector is phil gramm   the same man who helped write john mccain's economic plan  the same man who said that we're going through a 'mental recession'  and the same man who called the united states of america a  nation of whiners  so it's hard to understand how senator mccain is going to get us out of this crisis by doing the same things with the same old players  make no mistake  my opponent is running for four more years of policies that will throw the economy further out of balance  his outrage at wall street would be more convincing if he wasn't offering them more tax cuts  his call for fiscal responsibility would be believable if he wasn't for more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  and more of a trillion dollar war in iraq paid for with deficit spending and borrowing from foreign creditors like china  his newfound support for regulation bears no resemblance to his scornful attitude towards oversight and enforcement  john mccain cannot be trusted to reestablish proper oversight of our financial markets for one simple reason  he has shown time and again that he does not believe in it  what has happened these last eight years is not some historical anomaly  so we know what to expect if we try these policies for another four  when lobbyists run your campaign  the special interests end up gaming the system  when the white house is hostile to any kind of oversight  corporations cut corners and consumers pay the price  when regulators are chosen for their disdain for regulation and we gut their ability to enforce the law  then the interests of the american people are not protected  it's an ideology that intentionally breeds incompetence in washington and irresponsibility on wall street  and it's time to turn the page  just today  senator mccain offered up the oldest washington stunt in the book   you pass the buck to a commission to study the problem  but here's the thing   this isn't   we know how we got into this mess  what we need now is leadership that gets us out  i'll provide it  john mccain won't  and that's the choice for the american people in this election  history shows us that there is no substitute for presidential leadership in a time of economic crisis  fdr and harry truman didn't put their heads in the sand  or hand accountability over to a commission  bill clinton didn't put off hard choices  they led  and that's what i will do  my priority as president will be the stability of the american economy and the prosperity of the american people  and i will make sure that our response focuses on middle class americans   not the companies that created the problem  to get out of this crisis   and to ensure that we are not doomed to repeat a cycle of bubble and bust again and again   we must take immediate measures to create jobs and continue to address the housing crisis  we must build a  st century regulatory framework  and we must pursue a bold opportunity agenda that creates new jobs and grows the american economy  to jumpstart job creation  i have proposed a   billion emergency economic plan that would save   million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure  repairing our schools  and helping our states and localities avoid damaging budget cuts  i worked with leaders in congress to create a new fha housing security program  which will help stabilize the housing market and allow americans facing foreclosure to keep their homes at rates they can afford  going forward  we need to replace fannie mae and freddie mac as we know them with a structure that is focused on helping people buy homes   not engaging in market speculation  we can't have a situation like the old s amp l  scandal where its  heads  investors win  and  tails  taxpayers lose  that's going to take ending the lobbyist driven dominance of these institutions that we've seen for far too long in washington  to prevent fraud in the mortgage market  i've proposed tough penalties on fraudulent lenders  and a home score system that will ensure consumers fully understand mortgage offers and whether they'll be able to make payments  to help low  and middle income families  i will ease the burden on struggling homeowners through a universal homeowner's tax credit  this will add up to a   percent break off the mortgage interest rate for   million households  that's another   each year for many middle class families  unlike senator mccain  i will change our bankruptcy laws to make it easier for families to stay in their homes  right now  if you're a family that owns one house  bankruptcy judges are actually barred from helping you keep a roof over your head by writing down the value of your mortgage  if you own seven homes  the judge is free to write down any or all of the debt on your second  third  fourth  fifth  sixth or seventh homes  now that may be of comfort to senator mccain  but that's the kind of out of touch washington loophole that makes no sense  when i'm president  we'll make our laws work for working people  but as we've seen the last few days  the crisis in our financial markets now reaches well beyond the housing market  that's why it's time to do what i called for last september and again this past march   and it is only more overdue today  our capital markets cannot succeed without the public's trust  it's time to get serious about regulatory oversight  and that's what i will do as president  that starts with the core principles for reform that i discussed at cooper union  first  if you're a financial institution that can borrow from the government  you should be subject to government oversight and supervision  when the federal reserve steps in as a lender of last resort  it is providing an insurance policy underwritten by the american taxpayer  in return  taxpayers have every right to expect that financial institutions with access to that credit are not taking excessive risks  second  we must reform requirements on all regulated financial institutions  we must strengthen capital requirements  particularly for complex financial instruments like some of the mortgage securities and other derivatives at the center of our current crisis  we must develop and rigorously manage liquidity risk  we must investigate rating agencies and potential conflicts of interest with the people they are rating  and we must establish transparency requirements that demand full disclosure by financial institutions to shareholders and counterparties  as we reform our regulatory system at home  we must address the same problems abroad so that financial institutions around the world are subject to similar rules of the road  third  we need to streamline our regulatory agencies  our overlapping and competing regulatory agencies cannot oversee the large and complex institutions that dominate the financial landscape  different institutions compete in multiple markets   washington should not pretend otherwise  a streamlined system will provide better oversight and reduce costs  fourth  we need to regulate institutions for what they do  not what they are  over the last few years  commercial banks and thrift institutions were subject to guidelines on subprime mortgages that did not apply to mortgage brokers and companies  this regulatory framework failed to protect homeowners  and made no sense for our financial system  when it comes to protecting the american people  it should make no difference what kind of institution they are dealing with  fifth  we must crack down on trading activity that crosses the line to market manipulation  the last six months have shown that this remains a serious problem in many markets and becomes especially problematic during moments of great financial turmoil  we cannot embrace the administration's vision of turning over the protection of investors to the industries themselves  we need regulators that actually enforce the rules instead of overlooking them  the sec should investigate and punish market manipulation  and report its conclusions to congress  sixth  we must establish a process that identifies systemic risks to the financial system like the crisis that has overtaken our economy  too often  we end up where we are today  dealing with threats to the financial system that weren't anticipated by regulators  we need a standing financial market advisory group to meet regularly and provide advice to the president  congress  and regulators on the state of our financial markets and the risks they face  it's time to anticipate risks before they erupt into a full blown crisis  these six principles should guide the legal reforms needed to establish a  st century regulatory system  but the change we need goes beyond laws and regulation  financial institutions must do a better job at managing risks  there is something wrong when boards of directors or senior managers don't understand the implications of the risks assumed by their own institutions  it's time to realign incentives and ceo compensation packages  so that both high level executives and employees better serve the interests of shareholders  finally  the american people must be able to trust that their government is looking out for all of us   not the special interests that have set the agenda in washington for eight years  and the lobbyists who run john mccain's campaign  i've spent my career taking on lobbyists and their money  and i've won  if you wanted a special favor in illinois  there was actually a law that let you give campaign cash to politicians for their own personal use  in the state house  they called it business as usual  i called it legalized bribery  and while it didn't make me the most popular guy in springfield  i put an end to it  when i got to washington  we saw some of the worst corruption since watergate  i led the fight for reform in my party  and let me tell you   not everyone in my party was too happy about it  when i proposed forcing lobbyists to disclose who they're raising money from and who in congress they're funneling it to  i had a few choice words directed my way on the floor of the senate  but we got it done  and we banned gifts from lobbyists  and free rides on their fancy jets  and i am the only candidate who can say that washington lobbyists do not fund my campaign  they will not run my white house  and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i am president of the united states  that's how we're going to end the outrage of special interests tipping the scales  the most important thing we must do is restore opportunity for all americans  to get our economy growing  we need to recapture that fundamental american promise  that if you work hard  you can pay the bills  that if you get sick  you won't go bankrupt  that your kids can get a good education  and that we can leave a legacy of greater opportunity to future generations  that's the change the american people need  while senator mccain likes to talk about change these days  his economic program offers nothing but more of the same  the american people need more than change as a slogan  we need change that makes a real difference in your life  change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it  but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it  i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas  and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america  i will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start ups   that's how we'll grow our economy and create the high wage  high tech jobs of tomorrow  i will cut taxes   cut taxes   for   of all working families  my opponent doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  if you make less than   a year  you will not see your taxes increase one single dime  in fact  i offer three times the tax relief for middle class families as senator mccain does   because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  i will finally keep the promise of affordable  accessible health care for every single american  if you have health care  my plan will lower your premiums  if you don't  you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  and i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most i will create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy  we'll tap our natural gas reserves  invest in clean coal technology  and find ways to safely harness nuclear power  i'll help our auto companies re tool  so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america  i'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars  and i'll invest   billion dollars over the next decade in affordable  renewable sources of energy   wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels  an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced and now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education  because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy  i'll recruit an army of new teachers  and pay them higher salaries and give them more support  but in exchange  i will ask for higher standards and more accountability  and we will keep our promise to every young american   if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford a college education  this is the change we need   the kind of bottom up growth and innovation that will advance the american economy by advancing the dreams of all americans  times are hard  i will not pretend that the changes we need will come without cost   though i have presented ways we can achieve these changes in a fiscally responsible way  i know that we'll have to overcome our doubts and divisions and the determined opposition of powerful special interests before we can truly reform a broken economy and advance opportunity  but i am running for president because we simply cannot afford four more years of an economic philosophy that works for wall street instead of main street  and ends up devastating both  i don't want to wake up in four years to find that more americans fell out of the middle class  and more families lost their savings  i don't want to see that our country failed to invest in our ability to compete  our children's future was mortgaged on another mountain of debt  and our financial markets failed to find a firmer footing  this time   this election   is our chance to stand up and say  enough is enough  we can do this because americans have done this before  time and again  we've battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  that's why our economy hasn't just been the world's greatest wealth generator   it's bound america together  it's created jobs  and it's made the dream of opportunity a reality for generation after generation of americans  now it falls to us  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking just like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education so that our kids can compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  and make some calls  and talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will win colorado  we will win this election  and we will change america together "], ["obama1", "the events of this week have shown that the stakes in this election couldn't be clearer  we are in the midst of the most serious financial crisis in generations  three of america's five largest investment banks have failed or been sold off in distress  our housing market is in shambles  and monday brought the worst losses on wall street since the day after september  th  monday brought the worst losses on wall street since the day after september  th  and today we learned that the fed had to take unprecedented action to prevent the failure of one of the largest insurance companies in the world from causing an even larger crisis  while we do not know all the details of the arrangement with aig  the federal reserve must ensure that the plan protects the families that count on insurance  it should bolster our economy's ability to create good paying jobs and help working americans pay their bills and save their money  it must not bail out the shareholders or management of aig  everywhere you look  the economic news is troubling  but for so many americans  it isn't really news at all    workers have lost their jobs since january  home values are falling  your paycheck doesn't go as far as it used to  it's never been harder to save or retire  to buy gas or groceries  and if you put it on a credit card  they've probably raised your rates  in so many cities and towns across america  it feels as if the dream that so many generations have fought for is slowly slipping away  i have every confidence that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  that's who we are  that's what we've always done as americans  but the one thing i do know is this   we can't steer ourselves out of this crisis by heading in the same  disastrous direction  and that's what this election is about  it's been an interesting week for john mccain  it's been really interesting to watch him respond to this economic news  his first reaction to this crisis on monday was to stand up and repeat the line he's said over and over and over again throughout this campaign   quote    the fundamentals of our economy are strong  now  his campaign must've realized that probably wasn't a smart thing to say on the day of a financial meltdown  so they sent him back out a few hours later to clean up his remarks  but it sounds like he got a little carried away  because yesterday  john mccain actually said that if he's president  he'll take on the   quote    ol' boys network  in washington  i am not making this up  this is someone who's been in congress for twenty six years   who put seven of the most powerful washington lobbyists in charge of his campaign   and now he tells us that he's the one who will take on the ol' boy network  the ol' boy network  in the mccain campaign  that's called a staff meeting  john mccain went on to say how angry he is at the greedy corporate interests on wall street  he's so angry he wants to punish them with   billion in tax cuts  and if they're not careful  he'll give them even more tax cuts for shipping our jobs overseas  i mean  where is he getting these lines  the lobbyists running his campaign  maybe it's phil gramm   the man who was the architect of the de regulation in washington that helped cause the mess on wall street  who also happens to be the architect of john mccain's economic plan and one of his chief advisors  you remember phil gramm   he's the guy who said that we're just going through a  mental recession  who called the united states of america a  nation of whiners  and then yesterday  john mccain's big solution to the crisis we're facing is   get ready for it   a commission  that's washington speak for  we'll get back to you later  folks  we don't need a commission to figure out what happened  we know what happened  too many in washington and on wall street weren't minding the store  ceos got greedy  lobbyists got their way  politicians sat on their hands until it was too late  we don't need a commission to tell us how we got into this mess  we need a president who will lead us out of this mess   and that's the kind of president i intend to be  so while he isn't offering real solutions  he can't talk enough about how greedy wall street is  and how he's going to take on that ol' boy network in washington  at this rate  by the end of the week john mccain will be telling us how he and phil gramm and the seven lobbyists are planning to storm the treasury department with torches and pitchforks  come on  now  i certainly don't fault senator mccain for all of the problems we're facing right now  but i do fault the economic philosophy he's followed for twenty six years  it's a philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down  it's a philosophy that says even common sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise  it's a philosophy that lets washington lobbyists shred consumer protections and distort our economy so it works for the special interests instead of working people  well let's be clear  what we've seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on this philosophy   a philosophy that has completely failed  and i am running for president of the united states because the dreams of the american people must not be endangered any more  it's time to put an end to a broken system in washington that is breaking the american economy  it's time for change that makes a real difference in your lives  we have a different way of measuring the fundamentals of our economy  we know that the fundamentals that we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great   that america is a place where you can make it if you try  that everyone should have the chance to live their dreams  i know i wouldn't be standing here today without that promise  and i know that's the promise we must keep once more  when i talk to those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan  i see my grandfather  who signed up after pearl harbor  marched in patton's army  and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill  in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift  i think about my mom  who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree  who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country  and when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down  i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed  these are my heroes  theirs are the stories that shaped me  and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep the promise of america alive as president of the united states  unlike senator mccain  it didn't take a crisis on wall street for me to understand that folks are hurting out on main street  it was two years ago that i introduced legislation to stop mortgage transactions that promoted fraud  risk or abuse  it was one year ago that i called on our treasury secretary and our fed chairman to bring every stakeholder together and find a solution to the subprime mortgage meltdown before it got worse  in march  when john mccain was saying  i'm always for less regulation  i called for a new   st century regulatory framework to restore accountability  transparency  and trust in our financial markets  i believe that our free market has been the engine of america's great progress  it's a market that has created a prosperity that is the envy of the world  and rewarded the innovators and risk takers who have made america a beacon of science  and technology  and discovery  but the american economy has worked in large part because we have guided the market's invisible hand with a higher principle   that america prospers when all americans can prosper  that's why we've put in place rules of the road to make competition fair  and open  and honest  our capital markets cannot succeed without the public's trust  it's time to get serious about regulatory oversight  and that's what i will do as president  to jumpstart job creation  i've also proposed a   billion emergency economic plan that would save   million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure  repairing our schools  and helping our states and localities avoid damaging budget cuts  to help people stay in their homes  i will change our bankruptcy laws  and i'll offer a tax credit to struggling families that will take   off your mortgage interest rate  i'll institute a home score system that will help every consumer figure out whether they'll be able to make their mortgage payments before they buy their house  and i will crack down on predatory lenders with tough new penalties that will treat mortgage fraud like the crime that it is  but the most important thing i will do as president is restore opportunity for all americans  to get our economy growing  we need to recapture that fundamental american promise  that if you work hard  you can pay the bills  that if you get sick  you won't go bankrupt  that your kids can get a good education  and that we can leave a legacy of greater opportunity to future generations  that's the change the american people need  change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it  but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it  i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas  and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america  i will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start ups   that's how we'll grow our economy and create the high wage  high tech jobs of tomorrow  i will cut taxes   cut taxes   for   of all working families  my opponent doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  if you make less than   a year  you will not see your taxes increase one single dime  in fact  i offer three times the tax relief for middle class families as senator mccain does   because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  i will finally keep the promise of affordable  accessible health care for every single american  if you have health care  my plan will lower your premiums  if you don't  you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  and i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most i will create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy  we'll tap our natural gas reserves  invest in clean coal technology  and find ways to safely harness nuclear power  i'll help our auto companies re tool  so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america  i'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars  and i'll invest   billion dollars over the next decade in affordable  renewable sources of energy   wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels  an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced and now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education  because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy  i'll recruit an army of new teachers  and pay them higher salaries and give them more support  but in exchange  i will ask for higher standards and more accountability  and we will keep our promise to every young american   if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford a college education  this is the change we need   the kind of bottom up growth and innovation that will advance the american economy by advancing the dreams of all americans  times are hard  i will not pretend that the change we need will come without cost   though i have presented ways we can achieve these changes in a fiscally responsible way  i know that we'll have to overcome our doubts and divisions and the determined opposition of powerful special interests before we can truly reform a broken economy and advance opportunity  but i am running for president because we simply cannot afford four more years of an economic philosophy that works for wall street instead of main street  and ends up devastating both  i don't want to wake up in four years to find that more americans fell out of the middle class  and more families lost their savings  i don't want to see that our country failed to invest in our ability to compete  our children's future was mortgaged on another mountain of debt  and our financial markets failed to find a firmer footing  this time   this election   is our chance to stand up and say  enough is enough  we can do this because americans have done this before  time and again  we've battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  that's why our economy hasn't just been the world's greatest wealth generator   it's bound america together  it's created jobs  and it's made the dream of opportunity a reality for generation after generation of americans  now it falls to us  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking just like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education so that our kids can compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  and make some calls  and talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will win nevada  we will win this election  and we will change america together "], ["obama1", "i just want to begin by saying a few words about the turmoil in our financial markets  we are in the midst of the most serious financial crisis in generations  three of america's five largest investment banks have failed or been sold off in distress  our housing market is in shambles  monday brought the worst losses on wall street since the day after september  th  and the fed has had to take unprecedented action to prevent the failure of one of the largest insurance companies in the world from causing an even larger crisis  just this morning  we learned that the fed had to act with central banks around the world to maintain the functioning of our financial system  everywhere you look  the economic news is troubling  but for so many americans  it isn't really news at all    workers have lost their jobs since january  home values are falling  your paycheck doesn't go as far as it used to  it's never been harder to save or retire  to buy gas or groceries  and if you put it on a credit card  they've probably raised your rates  in so many cities and towns across america  it feels as if the dream that so many generations have fought for is slowly slipping away  so i know these are difficult days  and i know there are a lot of families that are feeling anxiety right now   about their jobs  about their homes  about their retirement savings  but here's what i also know  this isn't a time for fear or panic   this is a time for resolve and for leadership  i know we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  that's who we are  that's what we've always done as americans  our nation has faced difficult times before  and at each of those moments  we've risen to meet the challenge because we've never forgotten that fundamental truth   that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  but another thing i know is this   we can't steer ourselves out of this crisis by heading in the same  disastrous direction  we can't change direction with a new driver who wants to follow the same old map  and that's what this election is all about  my opponent's first reaction to this crisis on monday was to stand up and repeat the line he's said over and over again throughout this campaign   quote    the fundamentals of our economy are strong  the comment was out so out of touch that even george bush's white house couldn't agree with it  but the truth is  john mccain's attitude was nothing new  it reflects the same economic philosophy that he has had for twenty six years in washington  the same philosophy he shares with george bush  it's the philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down  it's the philosophy that says even common sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise  it's a philosophy that lets washington lobbyists shred consumer protections and distort our economy so it works for the special interests instead of working people  that's the philosophy john mccain believes in  and has always believed in  he's spent decades in washington supporting financial institutions instead of their customers  phil gramm  one of the architects of the de regulation in washington that led directly to this mess on wall street  is also the architect of john mccain's economic plan   the man john mccain wants to put in charge of the treasury department if he's president  you remember phil gramm   he's the guy who said that we're going through a 'mental recession'  and the same man who called the united states of america a  nation of whiners  that's who john mccain listens to  he has consistently opposed the sorts of common sense regulations that might have lessened the current crisis  when i was warning about the danger ahead on wall street months ago because of the lack of oversight  senator mccain was telling the wall street journal and i quote i'm always for less regulation  except now  with the magnitude of the crisis apparent even to the bush white house  john mccain wants to reverse course  now  all of a sudden  he's unleashed an angry tirade against all the insiders and lobbyists who've supported him for twenty six years   the same folks who run his campaign  on monday  he said the economy was fundamentally sound  and he was fundamentally wrong  on tuesday  he said the government should stand by and allow one of the nation's largest insurers to collapse  putting the well being of millions of americans at risk  but by wednesday  he changed his mind  he said he would take on the ol' boy network  but he seemed to forget that he took seven of the biggest lobbyists in washington from that network and put them in charge of your campaign  john mccain can't decide whether he's barry goldwater or dennis kucinich  well  i have a message for senator mccain  you can't just run away from your long held views or your life long record  you can't erase twenty six years of support for the very policies and people who helped bring on this disaster with one week of rants  what we need is honest talk and real solutions  senator mccain's first answer to this economic crisis was   get ready for it   a commission  that's washington speak for  we'll get back to you later  folks  we don't need a commission to spend a few years and a lot of taxpayer money to tell us what's going on in our economy  we don't need a commission to tell us gas prices are high or that you can't pay your bills  we don't need a commission to tell us you're losing your jobs  we don't need a commission to study this crisis  we need a president who will solve it   and that's the kind of president i intend to be  now that this disaster has hit  john mccain is calling for the firing of the security and exchange commissioner  well here's what i say  in   days  you can fire the whole trickle down  on your own  look the other way crowd in washington who have led us down this disastrous path  let's be clear  what we've seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed  and i am running for president of the united states because the dreams of the american people must not be endangered any more  it's time to put an end to a broken system in washington that is breaking the american economy  it's time for change that makes a real difference in your lives  it was two years ago that i introduced legislation to stop mortgage transactions that promoted fraud  risk or abuse  it was one year ago that i called on our treasury secretary and our fed chairman to bring every stakeholder together and find a solution to the subprime mortgage meltdown before it got worse  in march  when john mccain was saying  i'm always for less regulation  i called for a new   st century regulatory framework to restore accountability  transparency  and trust in our financial markets  the events of the past few days have made clear that we need to do more right now  we do not have time for commissions and we can't afford to lurch back and forth between positions when dealing with an economic crisis  like my opponent has  that is why i am calling on the treasury and the federal reserve to use their emergency authorities to maintain the flow of credit  to support the availability of mortgages  and to ensure that our financial system is well capitalized  tomorrow i will be convening a meeting with my top economic advisors to discuss a plan based on the ideas i've been talking about with former fed chairman paul volcker and other advisors of mine  then i'll call for the passage of a homeowner and financial support act that would establish a more stable and permanent solution than the daily improvisations that have characterized policy making over the last year  specifically  it would accomplish three primary goals  first  it will provide capital to the financial system  second  it will provide liquidity to enable our financial markets to function  and third  it will do what i've been calling for since i supported legislation on it early last spring  which is to get serious about helping struggling families to re structure their mortgages on more affordable terms so they can stay in their homes  we've made a good start but we need to do much  much more  we cannot forget that there are many homeowners who are in crisis through no fault of their own  and a solution that does not have them at its core is no solution at all  to jumpstart job creation  i've also proposed a   billion emergency economic plan that would save   million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure  repairing our schools  and helping our states and localities avoid damaging budget cuts  to help people stay in their homes  i will change our bankruptcy laws  and i'll offer a tax credit to struggling families that will take   off your mortgage interest rate  i'll institute a home score system that will help every consumer figure out whether they'll be able to make their mortgage payments before they buy their house  and i will crack down on predatory lenders   lenders who all too often target hispanic communities   with tough new penalties that will treat mortgage fraud like the crime that it is  but the most important thing i will do as president is restore opportunity for all americans  to get our economy growing  we need to recapture that fundamental american promise  that if you work hard  you can pay the bills  that if you get sick  you won't go bankrupt  that your kids can get a good education  and that we can leave a legacy of greater opportunity to future

fact  i offer three times the tax relief for middle class families as senator mccain does   because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  i will finally keep the promise of affordable  accessible health care for every single american  i know this is a critical issue in the hispanic community  where one in three people don't have health insurance  under my plan  if you have health care  my plan will lower your premiums  if you don't  you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  and i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most i will create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy  we'll tap our natural gas

moral obligation to provide every child a world class education  because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy  i refuse to accept that overcrowded  underfunded schools are the best we can do for our kids  i refuse to accept four in ten hispanic students dropping out of high school   i know we can do better than that  so i'll recruit an army of new teachers  and pay them higher salaries and give them more support  but in exchange  i will ask for higher standards and more accountability  and we will keep our promise to every young american   if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford a college education  this is the change we need   the kind of bottom up growth and innovation that will advance the american economy by advancing the dreams of all americans  times are hard  i will not pretend that the change will need will come without cost   though i have presented ways we can achieve these changes in a fiscally

election  some of the closest contests this november will be in states like florida  colorado  nevada  and here in new mexico   states with large hispanic populations  and if you have any doubt about whether you can make a difference  just remember how  back in     registered hispanic voters in new mexico didn't turn out on election day  senator kerry lost this state by fewer than   votes    votes  and today  in   an estimated   hispanics in new mexico aren't registered to vote  so i'm not taking a single hispanic vote for granted in this campaign  we're meeting with hispanic leaders  and reaching out to hispanic organizations  and holding hispanic voter registration drives across america  and if you help me organize and get people to the polls to cast their votes on november  th  then i promise you   we will win new mexico  we will win this election  and we will change america together "], ["obama1", "we are facing one of the most serious financial crises in this nation's history  the events of the last week   from the failure of lehman to the bailout of aig to the continued volatility of the market   have not just threatened the trading floors and high rises of wall street  but the stability and security of our entire global economy  across this country  americans are worried about whether they can make their mortgage payments  or keep their jobs  or ensure that their retirement is secure  truly  we are all in this together  our government and the federal reserve have already taken unprecedented action to prevent a deepening of this crisis that could jeopardize the life savings and well being of millions of americans  but it is now clear that even bolder and more decisive action is necessary  in recent years  i have outlined plans that would have helped prevent the problems we now face  and yesterday i proposed the outlines of a plan that would establish a more stable and permanent solution to strengthen our financial system  today  i fully support the effort of secretary paulson and federal reserve chairman bernanke to work in a bipartisan spirit with congress to find this kind of solution  what we're looking at right now is to provide the treasury and the federal reserve with as broad authority as necessary to stabilize markets and maintain credit  we need a more institutional response to create a system that can manage some of the underlying problems with bad mortgages  help homeowners stay in their homes  protect the retirement and savings of working americans  in the coming days  i will more closely examine the details of the treasury and fed proposal  and as i do  i'll work to ensure that it provides an effective emergency response by including four basic principles that my economic advisors and i just discussed this morning  first  we cannot only have a plan for wall street  we must also help main street as well  i'm glad that our government is moving so quickly in addressing the crisis that threatens some of our biggest banks and corporations  but a similar crisis has threatened families  workers and homeowners for months and months and washington has done far too little to help  for too long  this administration has been willing to hit the fast forward button in helping distressed wall street firms while pressing pause when it comes to saving jobs or keeping people in their homes  we already know that the credit crisis that has emerged from our largest financial institutions is becoming a credit crunch for small business owners  homeowners  and students seeking loans in big cities and small towns  now that american taxpayers are being called on to share in this new burden  we must take equally swift and serious action to help lift the burdens they face every day  in the same bipartisan spirit that is being shown with regard to the crisis on wall street  i ask senator mccain  president bush  republicans and democrats to join me in supporting an emergency economic plan for working families   a plan that would help folks cope with rising gas and food prices  spark job creation through repair of our schools and roads  help states and cities avoid painful budget cuts and tax increases  help homeowners stay in their homes  and provide retooling assistance for america's auto industry  john mccain and i can continue to argue about our different economic agendas for next year  but we should come together now to work on what this country urgently needs this year  the second principle i would like to see in the emerging plan from the treasury and the fed is that our approach should be one of mutual responsibility and reciprocity  it must not be designed to reward particular companies or the irresponsible decisions of borrowers or lenders  it must not be designed to enhance the personal gain of ceos and management  the recklessness of some of these executives has helped cause this mess  even as they walk away with multimillion dollar golden parachutes while taxpayers are left holding the bag  as taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary steps to protect our financial system  it is only appropriate that those who benefit be expected to contribute to the protection of american homeowners and the american economy  just as support is not designed to payoff egregious executive compensation  it should not reward those who are ruthlessly foreclosing on american families  third  this plan must be temporary and coupled with tough new oversight and regulations of our financial institutions  and there must be a clear process to wind down this plan and restore private sector assets into private sector hands after restoring stability to the system  taxpayers must share in any upside benefit that such stability brings  fourth  this plan should be part of a globally coordinated effort with our partners in the g  this is a worldwide issue  and while the united states can and will lead in stabilizing the credit markets  we should ask other nations  who share in this crisis  to be part of the solution as well  one last point  we did not arrive at this crisis by some accident of history  what led us to this point was years and years of a philosophy in washington and on wall street that viewed even common sense regulation and oversight as unwise and unnecessary  that shredded consumer protections and loosened the rules of the road  ceos and executives got reckless  lobbyists got what they wanted  politicians in both parties looked the other way until it was too late  and it is the american people who have paid the price  the events of this week have rendered a final verdict on that failed philosophy  and it will end if i am president of the united states  we must build upon the ideas i have laid out over the last several years about how to modernize our financial regulation in this country  and establish commonsense rules of the road for our financial system to help restore confidence in our financial system  finally  given the gravity of this situation  and based on conversations i have had with both secretary paulson and chairman bernanke  i will refrain from presenting a more detailed blue print of how an immediate plan might be structured until i can fully review the details of the plan proposed by the treasury and the federal reserve  it is critical at this point that the markets and the public have confidence that their work will be unimpeded by partisan wrangling  and that leaders in both parties work in concert to solve the problem at hand  i know these are difficult days  and i know there are a lot of families out there right now who are feeling anxiety   about their jobs  about their homes  about their retirement savings  but here's what i also know  this isn't a time for fear or panic  this is a time for resolve and for leadership  i know we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  that's who we are  that's what we've always done as americans  our nation has faced difficult times before  and at each of those moments  we've risen to meet the challenges as one people  and one nation  that is the america we need to be and can be today "], ["obama1", "here in florida  less than two months before election day  i know you've all been hearing a lot about politics  and we all know how important women will be in determining the outcome of this election  but as i stand here with all of you  i know this isn't just about politics for me  this is personal  because i come here today not just as a candidate for president   but as a son  a grandson  a husband and a father who's seen firsthand  throughout my life  the challenges so many women face every day in this country  growing up  i saw my mother struggle to put herself through school and raise me and my sister on her own  she once had to turn to food stamps  but thanks to student loans  scholarships and a lot of hard work  her kids could attend some of the best schools in the country  i think women like her who work hard and pour everything they've got into their kids should be able to pay the bills and get ahead for a change   that's why i'm running for president  i saw my grandmother  who helped raise me  work her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management at a bank  but i also saw her hit a glass ceiling  as men no more qualified than she was moved up the corporate ladder ahead of her  i think women like her should be paid fairly and have the same chance to succeed as everyone else   that's why i'm running for president  i've seen my wife  michelle  the rock of the obama family  juggling work and parenting with more skill and grace than anyone i know  but i've seen how it's torn at her  how sometimes  when she's with the girls  she's worrying about work   and when she's at work  she's worrying about the girls  it's a feeling i share every day   especially these days  when i'm away so much  out on the campaign trail  and i think it should be a little easier for parents in this country to raise their kids and do their jobs   that's why i'm running for president  i know how hard the women of this country are working  i know the anxiety so many of you are feeling right now  as we stand in the midst of the most serious financial crisis of our time  we've seen three of america's five largest investment banks fail or be sold off in distress  our housing market is in shambles  and monday brought the worst losses on wall street since the day after september  th  everywhere you look  the economic news is troubling  but for so many of you  it isn't really news at all  you've seen your home values falling  gas prices rising  and bills piling up month after month  so you're working longer hours  or working more than one job just to get by  and then there are the jobs you do once the workday ends  jobs like paying the bills  buying the groceries  making the dinner  doing the laundry  enforcing the bedtimes   the jobs you don't get paid for  but that hold our families together  jobs that still  even in the year   too often fall to women  so i know these are difficult days  but here's what i also know  i know we can steer ourselves out of this economic crisis  that's who we are  that's what we've always done as americans  our nation has faced difficult times before  and at each of those moments  we've risen to meet the challenge because we've never forgotten that fundamental truth   that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  but another thing i know is that we can't steer ourselves out of this crisis by heading in the same  disastrous direction  we can't change direction with a new driver who wants to follow the same old map  and that's what this election is all about  yesterday  my opponent  senator mccain  gave a speech in which his big solution to this worldwide economic crisis was to blame me for it  this is a guy who's spent a quarter century in washington  and after spending the entire campaign saying i haven't been in washington long enough  he apparently now is willing to assign me responsibility for all of washington's failures  i think it's pretty clear that senator mccain is a little panicked  and that at this point  he is willing to say anything  do anything  change any position  violate any principle to try and win this election  and that is sad to see  that's not the politics we need  so let's be clear  there's only one candidate who   just this week   said a line he's repeated   times on this campaign   quote    the fundamentals of our economy are strong  there's only one candidate who's called himself  fundamentally a deregulator  when deregulation is part of the problem  my opponent actually wrote in the current issue of a health care magazine   the current issue   quote    opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition  as we have done over the last decade in banking  would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state based regulation  so let me get this straight   he wants to run health care like they've been running wall street  well  senator  i know some folks on main street who aren't going to think that's a good idea  there's only one candidate whose choice for treasury secretary is a man who thinks we're in a  mental recession  and has called the united states of america a   quote    nation of whiners  there's only one candidate whose campaign is being run by seven of washington's most powerful lobbyists  and folks  it isn't me  i don't take a dime from washington lobbyists and special interests  they do not run my campaign  they will not run my white house  and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i'm president of the united states  so when john mccain says that lobbyists  won't even get past the front gate  at his white house  my question is   who's going to stop them  those seven lobbyists  his campaign manager  the economic advisor  who got a   million golden parachute when she was fired as a ceo  or maybe the   advisors and fundraisers who lobbied for fannie mae and freddie mac  i mean  give me a break  the same day my opponent attacked me for being associated with a fannie mae guy i've talked to for maybe   minutes in my entire life   the same day he did that   the head of the lobbying shop at fannie mae turned around and said wait a minute    when i see photographs of senator mccain's staff  it looks to me like the team of lobbyists who used to report to me  folks  you can't make this stuff up  so when you hear john mccain talk about taking on the ol' boy network in washington   know this  on the mccain campaign  that's called a staff meeting  at this defining moment  when the stakes could not be higher  we need real change   change that's more than just a slogan  change that actually makes a difference in people's lives  and that's the kind of change i'll bring to washington when i'm president of the united states of america  the other day  i laid out a few principals for a plan that would establish a real and permanent solution to our economic crisis  first  we have to make sure that whatever plan our government comes up with works not just for wall street  but for main street  we have to make sure it helps folks cope with rising prices  and sparks job creation  and helps homeowners stay in their homes  that's the kind of help folks need right now  we also have to make sure that any plan we come up with is temporary and restores tough oversight and accountability on wall street  third  i want to make sure that we're not rewarding some of the very ceos who helped cause this mess  we're not going to stand for that  but if we're serious about putting our economy on a firmer footing and lifting up our hardworking families  there are some additional changes we're going to have to make  as well  because it's an outrage that women are still making   cents for every dollar that men make in this country  now  my opponent actually opposed legislation to help women get equal pay  because  in his view  the reason women aren't being paid fairly isn't discrimination on the job   it's because they need more education and training  that isn't change  change is finally closing that pay gap  it's unacceptable that women in this country are losing thousands of dollars each year   money you could use for gas or groceries or college tuition  this isn't just an economic issue for millions of american families   it's about our most fundamental values as a nation  that we treat people fairly  that we reward hard work  and there are no second class citizens in our workplaces  that's why i helped pass a law in illinois to give   more women protection from paycheck discrimination  that's why i co sponsored legislation in the u s  senate to make it easier for women to challenge pay discrimination  and that's why i won't give up until women in this country are paid what they've earned  and not a penny less  that's what change is  change isn't a president who thinks roe vs  wade is a flawed decision and whose party platform outlaws abortion  even in cases of rape and incest  change is a president who will stand up for choice   who understands that five men on the supreme court don't know better than women and their doctors what's best for a woman's health  that's why i fought so hard in illinois and in washington to stop laws that would've restricted choice  that's why i'm committed to appointing judges who understand how law operates in our daily lives  judges who will uphold the values at the core of our constitution  and that's why i will never back down in defending a woman's right to choose  change means refusing to accept an america where staying home with a new baby is treated as an unpaid vacation  and taking time off to take a sick parent to the hospital is a fireable offense  change means making sure people have paid sick days and tax credits to help with childcare  and expanding the family and medical leave act to help millions of people care for their kids and their parents and participate in school activities like parent teacher conferences and assemblies  because no matter what you do for a living  we can all agree that raising our kids and taking care of our families is the most important job we have  change means keeping the promise of affordable  accessible health care for every single american  under my plan  if you have health insurance  nothing changes for you  except that my plan will lower your health care costs  if you don't  you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  and i'll stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most  this is personal to me  my mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of   and i will never forget her lying in a hospital bed  in her final months  fighting with the insurance company over whether they'd cover her treatments because they claimed cancer was a pre existing condition  that's wrong  it's not who we are  and we're going to put an end to it  change means having a vice president who's spent his career working to improve women's lives  joe biden wrote the violence against women act so we'd finally treat domestic violence like the heinous crime that it is  and in case you were wondering  john mccain voted against that legislation  as someone who raised small kids on his own  and took the train home every night from washington to delaware to tuck those kids into bed  joe biden also knows firsthand what it means to juggle work and family  and you won't find a stronger champion for a woman's right to choose than joe biden  so i'm proud to have him by my side in this campaign  finally  change means building an economy that rewards work  creates jobs you can raise a family on  and gives each of us the chance to get ahead  and let me tell you  when it comes to the economic policies we'll pursue  senator mccain and i couldn't be more different  john mccain voted nineteen times against raising the minimum wage   i'll raise it  he voted against head start  against hiring new teachers  against pell grants  i'll invest in early childhood education  and recruit an army of new teachers to our schools  and provide a   tuition tax credit to help make college affordable for any middle class student who's willing to serve their community or their country  you invest in america  america invests in you  and together  we'll move this country forward  he wants to give tax breaks to oil companies and companies that ship jobs overseas   i want to give a tax break to   of all working families and create jobs here at home by investing in renewable energy  and don't be fooled by the tired old attacks my opponent is launching  he doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates will actually be lower than they were under ronald reagan  if you make less than   a year  you will not see your taxes increase one single dime  not one dime  in fact  i offer three times the tax relief for middle class families as senator mccain does   because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  and i'll protect social security  while john mccain wants to privatize it  without social security half of elderly women would be living in poverty   half  but if my opponent had his way  the millions of floridians who rely on it would've had their social security tied up in the stock market this week  millions would've watched as the market tumbled and their nest egg disappeared before their eyes  millions of families would've been scrambling to figure out how to give their mothers and fathers  their grandmothers and grandfathers  the secure retirement that every american deserves  so i know senator mccain is talking about a  casino culture  on wall street   but the fact is  he's the one who wants to gamble with your life savings  so let's be clear  when i'm president  we're not going to gamble with social security  we're not going to gamble with your ability to retire with dignity after a lifetime of hard work  we're going to strengthen and protect social security so it's a safety net our families can count on   today  tomorrow and always  florida  the stakes couldn't be higher  the choice couldn't be clearer  but still  we know that bringing the change we need won't be easy  we know we're up against a powerful  entrenched status quo in washington that will say anything and do anything and fight with everything they've got to keep things just the way they are  but i think we're up for the challenge  we always have been  that's why i'm standing here today  because of what my mother and grandmother did for me   because of their hard work and sacrifice and unflagging love  that's why all of us are here today   because of the women who came before us  women who reached for the ballot and raised families and traveled those lonely roads to be the first ones in those boardrooms and courtrooms and battlefields and factory floors  women like my friend hillary clinton who put those   million cracks in that glass ceiling so that my daughters   and all our sons and daughters   could dream a little bigger and reach a little higher  now it's our turn  it's our turn to make those sacrifices so the next generation doesn't have to  our turn to open the doors of opportunity that our daughters and granddaughters will one day walk through  our turn to fulfill the promise of this great nation that each of us   no matter what our background or where we come from   each of us has the chance to make it if we try  that's what i think about whenever i get the chance to tuck my girls in at night  how i want them   and all our daughters   to have no limits on their dreams  no obstacles to their achievement  no goals beyond their reach  how i want them to have opportunities their mothers and grandmothers never could've imagined  and i hope you'll join me  i hope you'll walk with me so that we can turn the page on the failed policies of the past  and if you'll make that commitment   if you'll knock on doors and make those calls and talk to your neighbors and give me your vote on november  th  then together  we won't just win an election  we will transform this nation  thank you  god bless you  and god bless america "], ["obama1", "the news of the day isn't good  the era of greed and irresponsibility on wall street and in washington has led us to a perilous moment  they said they wanted to let the market run free but instead they let it run wild  and now we are facing a financial crisis as profound as any we have faced since the great depression but here's the truth  regardless of how we got here  we're here today  and the circumstances we face require decisive action because your jobs  your savings  and your economic security are now at risk  we must work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to resolve this crisis to avert an even broader economic catastrophe  but washington also has to recognize that economic recovery requires that we act  not just to address the crisis on wall street  but also the crisis on main street and around kitchen tables across america  as of now  the bush administration has only offered a concept with a staggering price tag  not a plan  even if the u s  treasury recovers some or most of its investment over time  this initial outlay of up to   billion is sobering  and in return for their support  the american people must be assured that the deal reflects the basic principles of transparency  fairness  and reform  first  there must be no blank check when american taxpayers are on the hook for this much money  second  taxpayers shouldn't be spending a dime to reward ceos on wall street  third  taxpayers should be protected and should be able to recoup this investment  fourth  this plan has to help homeowners stay in their homes  fifth  this is a global crisis  and the united states must insist that other nations join us in helping secure the financial markets  sixth  we need to start putting in place the rules of the road i've been calling for for years to prevent this from ever happening again  and finally  this plan can't just be a plan for wall street  it has to be a plan for main street  we have to come together  as democrats and republicans  to pass a stimulus plan that will put money in the pockets of working families  save jobs  and prevent painful budget cuts and tax hikes in our states  so i know these are difficult days  but here's what i also know  i know we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  that's who we are  that's what we've always done as americans  our nation has faced difficult times before  and at each of those moments  we've risen to meet the challenge because we've never forgotten that fundamental truth   that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  it's written by us  but another thing i know is this   we can't steer ourselves out of this crisis by heading in the same  disastrous direction  and that's what this election is all about  because while i certainly don't fault senator mccain for all of the problems we're facing right now  i do fault the economic philosophy he's followed during his   years in washington  it's a philosophy that says it's ok to turn a blind eye to practices that reward financial manipulation instead of sound business decisions  it's a philosophy that says even common sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise  it's a philosophy that lets washington lobbyists shred consumer protections and distort our economy so it works for the special interests instead of working people and our country  we're now seeing the disastrous consequences of this philosophy all around us   on wall street as well as main street  and yet senator mccain  who candidly admitted not long ago that he doesn't know as much about economics as he should  wants to keep going down the same  disastrous path  he calls himself  fundamentally a deregulator  when reckless deregulation and lack of oversight is a big part of the problem  and here's the really scary part  now this  great deregulator  wants to turn his attention to health care  he wrote in the current issue of a magazine   the current issue   that we need to open up health care to   quote    more vigorous nationwide competition  as we have done over the last decade in banking  that's right  john mccain says he wants to do for health care what washington has done for banking  think about what that means  over the years  states have come up with common sense rules to make sure that insurance companies aren't just looking out for their own profits  but for your health  and we cannot toss those rules out the window  as anyone who has health care knows  the one thing we don't need to do is give insurance companies an even freer hand over what they charge  who they cover  and what they'll cover  the radical idea that government has no role to play in protecting ordinary americans has wreaked havoc on our economy  and we cannot let this dangerous philosophy spread to health care  what we've seen over the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on this failed philosophy  and i am running for president of the united states because the dreams of the american people must not be endangered any more  the times are too serious  the stakes are too high  at this moment  in this election  we need real change   change that's more than just a slogan  change that actually makes a difference in people's lives  and that's the kind of change i'll bring to washington when i'm president of the united states of america  that's the change the american people need  change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it  but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it  i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas  and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america  i will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start ups   that's how we'll grow our economy and create the high wage  high tech jobs of tomorrow  i will cut taxes   cut taxes   for   of all working families  my opponent doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  if you make less than   a year  you will not see your taxes increase one single dime  in fact  i offer three times the tax relief for middle class families as senator mccain does   because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  i will finally keep the promise of affordable  accessible health care for every single american  if you have health care  my plan will lower your premiums  if you don't  you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  and i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most  i will also create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy  we'll tap our natural gas reserves  invest in clean coal technology  and find ways to safely harness nuclear power  i'll help our auto companies re tool  so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america  i'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars  and i'll invest   billion dollars over the next decade in affordable  renewable sources of energy   wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels  an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced and now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education  because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy  i'll recruit an army of new teachers  and pay them higher salaries and give them more support  but in exchange  i will ask for higher standards and more accountability  and we will keep our promise to every young american   if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford a college education  this is the change we need   the kind of bottom up growth and innovation that will advance the american economy by advancing the dreams of all americans  times are hard  i will not pretend that the change we need will come without cost   though i have presented how we can achieve these changes in a fiscally responsible way  i know that we'll have to overcome our doubts and divisions and the determined opposition of powerful special interests before we can truly reform a broken economy and advance opportunity  but i am running for president because we simply cannot afford four more years of an economic philosophy that works for wall street instead of main street  and ends up devastating both  i don't want to wake up in four years to find that more americans fell out of the middle class  and more families lost their savings  i don't want to see that our country failed to invest in our ability to compete  our children's future was mortgaged on another mountain of debt  and our financial markets failed to find a firmer footing  at this defining moment  we have the chance to finally stand up and say  enough is enough  we can do this because americans have done this before  time and again  we've battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  that's why our economy hasn't just been the world's greatest wealth generator   it's bound america together  it's created jobs  and it's made the dream of opportunity a reality for generation after generation of americans  now it falls to us  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking just like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will win north carolina  we will win this election  and we will change america together "], ["obama1", "yesterday  the president said that congress should pass his proposal to ease the crisis on wall street without significant changes or improvements  now  there are many to blame for causing the current crisis  starting with the speculators who gamed the system and the regulators who looked the other way  but all of us now have a stake in solving it and saving our financial institutions from collapse  because if we don't  the jobs and life savings of millions will be put at risk  given that fact  the president's stubborn inflexibility is both unacceptable and disturbingly familiar  this is not the time for my way or the highway intransigence from anyone involved  it's not the time for fear or panic  it's the time for resolve  responsibility  and reasonableness  and it is wholly unreasonable to expect that american taxpayers would or should hand this administration or any administration a   billion blank check with absolutely no oversight or conditions when a lack of oversight in washington and on wall street is exactly what got us into this mess  now that the american people are being called upon to finance this solution  the american people have the right to certain protections and assurances from washington  first  the plan must include protections to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not used to further reward the bad behavior of irresponsible ceos on wall street  there has been talk that some ceos may refuse to cooperate with this plan if they have to forgo multi million dollar salaries  i cannot imagine a position more selfish and greedy at a time of national crisis  and i would like to speak directly to those ceos right now  do not make that mistake  you are stewards for workers and communities all across our country who have put their trust in you  with the enormous rewards you have reaped come responsibilities  and we expect and demand that you to live up to them  this plan cannot be a welfare program for wall street executives  second  the power to spend   billion of taxpayer money cannot be left to the discretion of one man  no matter who he is or which party he is from  i have great respect for secretary paulson  but he cannot act alone  we should set up an independent board that includes some of the most respected figures in our country  chosen by democrats and republicans  to provide oversight and accountability at every step of the way  i am heartened that secretary paulson appeared to be softening on this position in his testimony this morning  third  if taxpayers are being asked to underwrite hundreds of billions of dollars to solve this crisis  they must be treated like investors  the american people should share in the upside as wall street recovers  there are different ways to accomplish this  including putting equity into these firms instead of buying their troubled assets  but regardless of how we structure the plan  if the government makes any kind of profit on this deal  we must give every penny back to the taxpayers who put up the money in the first place  and after the economy recovers  we should institute a financial stability fee on the entire financial services industry to repay any losses to the american people and make sure we are never asked to foot the bill for wall street's mistakes again  we can ask taxpayers to make an investment in the stability of our economy  but we cannot ask them to hand their money over to wall street without some expectation of return  fourth  the final plan must provide help to families who are struggling to stay in their homes  we cannot simply bailout wall street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are facing foreclosure  there are a number of ways we can accomplish this  for example  we should consider giving the government the authority to purchase mortgages directly instead of simply mortgage backed securities  in the past  such an approach has allowed taxpayers to profit as the housing market recovered  this is not simply a question of looking after homeowners  it's doubtful that the economy as a whole can recover without the restoration of our housing sector  including a rebound in the home values that have suffered dramatically in recent months  finally  the american people need to know that we feel as great a sense of urgency about the emergency on main street as we do about the emergency on wall street  i have repeatedly called on president bush and senator mccain to join me in supporting an economic stimulus plan for working families   a plan that would help folks cope with rising food and gas prices  save one million jobs by rebuilding our schools and roads  help states and cities avoid painful budget cuts and tax increases  and help homeowners stay in their homes  let me be clear   we shouldn't include this stimulus package into this particular legislation  but as we solve the immediate crisis on wall street  we should move with the same sense of urgency to help main street  it is absolutely wrong to suggest that we cannot protect american taxpayers while still stabilizing our market and saving our financial system from collapse  we can and must do both  in summary  there is no doubt negotiations over the next few days will be difficult  i will continue to keep in close touch with secretary paulson  chairman bernanke  and the leaders of congress to ensure that we can work in a bipartisan manner to get this done as quickly as possible  our country is being tested by a very serious crisis  we are all in this together  and we must come together as democrats and republicans  on wall street and on main street to solve it  and with the proper spirit of cooperation  i know we can "], ["obama1", "we meet here at a time of great uncertainty for america  the era of greed and irresponsibility on wall street and in washington has led us to a financial crisis as serious as any we have faced since the great depression  they said they wanted to let the market run free but they let it run wild  and in doing so  they trampled our core values of fairness  balance  and responsibility to one another  everywhere you look  the economic news is troubling  but for so many americans  it isn't really news at all    workers have lost their jobs since january  home values are falling  your paycheck doesn't go as far as it used to  it's never been harder to save or retire  to buy gas or groceries  and if you put it on a credit card  they've probably raised your rates  in so many cities and towns across america  it feels as if the dream that so many generations have fought for is slowly slipping away  so i know these are difficult days  but here's what i also know  i know we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  because that's who we are  because that's what we've always done as americans  our nation has faced difficult times before  and at each of those moments  we've risen to meet the challenge because we've never forgotten that fundamental truth   that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  there are many to blame for causing the crisis we are in  and that starts with the speculators on wall street who gamed the system and the regulators in washington who looked the other way  but now that we're here  every american has a stake in solving this crisis and saving our financial system from collapse  because if we don't act  your jobs  your life savings  and your economic security will be put at risk  the clock is ticking on this crisis  we have to act swiftly  but we also have to get it right  that means everyone   republicans and democrats  the white house and congress   must work together to come up with a solution that protects american taxpayers and our economy without rewarding those whose greed helped bring us to this point  so we need to act and act now  this cannot fall victim to the usual partisan politics or special interest lobbying  but it also can't be negotiated by the administration with the same my way or the highway mentality that is all too familiar  this administration started off by asking for a blank check to solve this problem  to them  i say no  it is unacceptable to expect the american people to hand this administration or any administration a   billion check with no conditions and no oversight when a lack of oversight in washington and on wall street is exactly what got us into this mess  if the american people are being asked to pay for the solution to this crisis  then you have a right to make sure that your tax dollars are protected  that's why i've laid out a few a conditions for washington  first  we need to set up an independent board  selected by democrats and republicans  to provide oversight and accountability for how and where this money is spent at every step of the way  second  if american taxpayers are financing this solution  you should be treated like investors  that means that wall street and washington should give you every penny of your money back once this economy recovers  third  we cannot and will not simply bailout wall street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes  they deserve a plan too  finally   and this one is important   the american people should not be spending one dime to reward the same wall street ceos whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess  there has been talk that some ceos may refuse to cooperate with this plan if they have to give up their multi million dollar salaries  i cannot imagine a position more selfish and greedy at a time of national crisis  so i would like to speak directly to those ceos right now  do not make that mistake  the enormous rewards you have reaped come with serious responsibilities to your workers and the american people  and we expect and demand that you live up to those responsibility  i will not allow this plan to become a welfare program for wall street executives  now  in the last few days  my opponent has decided to start talking tough about ceo pay  he's suddenly a hard charging populist  and that's all well and good  but i sure wish he was talking the same way over a year ago  when i introduced a bill that would've helped stop the multi million dollar bonus packages that ceos grab on their way out the door  because he opposed that idea  i sure wish he joined me when i blew the whistle on the fired ceos of fannie mae and freddie mac who tried to walk away with golden parachutes  i sure wish he felt the same outrage about ceo pay when his top economic advisor   who he calls a 'role model'   walked away with a   million package after being fired from hewlett packard  i sure wish he would change his current plan to give the average fortune   ceo a   tax cut at a time when millions of americans are struggling to pay their bills  that's what i'd like to hear  you see  the john mccain you've heard from over the last few days is a lot different than the john mccain who's been in washington for the last twenty six years  he talks about getting tough on wall street now  but he's been against the common sense rules and regulations that could've stopped this mess for decades  he says he'll take on the corporate lobbyists  but he put seven of the biggest lobbyists in washington in charge of his campaign  and if you think those lobbyists are working day and night to elect my opponent just to put themselves out of business  well i've got a bridge to sell you up in alaska  the truth is  when my opponent first reacted to this crisis by saying that the fundamentals of our economy are strong  he didn't just make a mistake  he revealed an out of touch philosophy he's followed for decades in washington   the idea that if we give more and more to those with the most  prosperity will trickle down to everyone else  the idea that no harm will be done if we let lobbyists shred consumer protections and fight against every regulation as unwise or unnecessary  well what we have seen over the last few weeks is nothing less than the final verdict on this failed philosophy  and i am running for president of the united states because the dreams of the american people cannot be endangered anymore  we have a different way of measuring the fundamentals of our economy  we know that the fundamentals that we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great  that america is a place where you can make it if you try  that everyone should have the chance to live their dreams  i know i wouldn't be standing here today without that promise  and i know that's the promise we must keep once more  when i talk to those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan  i see my grandfather  who signed up after pearl harbor  marched in patton's army  and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill  in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift  i think about my mom  who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree  who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country  and when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down  i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed  these are my heroes  theirs are the stories that shaped me  and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep the promise of america alive as president of the united states  unlike senator mccain  it didn't take a crisis on wall street for me to understand that folks are hurting out on main street  it was two years ago that i introduced legislation to stop mortgage transactions that promoted fraud  risk or abuse  it was one year ago that i called on our treasury secretary and our fed chairman to bring every stakeholder together and find a solution to the subprime mortgage meltdown before it got worse  in march  when john mccain was saying  i'm always for less regulation  i called for a new   st century regulatory framework to restore accountability  transparency  and trust in our financial markets  i believe that our free market has been the engine of america's great progress  it's a market that has created a prosperity that is the envy of the world  and rewarded the innovators and risk takers who have made america a beacon of science  and technology  and discovery  but the american economy has worked in large part because we have guided the market's invisible hand with a higher principle   that america prospers when all americans can prosper  that's the change we need right now  and that's the kind of change i'll bring to washington when i'm president of the united states of america  change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it  but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it  i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas  and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america  i will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start ups   that's how we'll grow our economy and create the high wage  high tech jobs of tomorrow  i will cut taxes   cut taxes   for   of all working families  my opponent doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  if you make less than   a year  you will not see your taxes increase one single dime  in fact  i offer three times the tax relief for middle class families as senator mccain does   because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  i will finally keep the promise of affordable  accessible health care for every single american  if you have health care  my plan will lower your premiums  if you don't  you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  and i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most  i will also create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy  we'll tap our natural gas reserves  invest in clean coal technology  and find ways to safely harness nuclear power  i'll help our auto companies re tool  so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america  i'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars  and i'll invest   billion dollars over the next decade in affordable  renewable sources of energy   wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels  an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced and now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education  because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy  i'll recruit an army of new teachers  and pay them higher salaries and give them more support  but in exchange  i will ask for higher standards and more accountability  and we will keep our promise to every young american   if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford a college education  this is the change we need   the kind of bottom up growth and innovation that will advance the american economy by advancing the dreams of all americans  times are hard  i will not pretend that the change we need will come without cost   though i have presented how we can achieve these changes in a fiscally responsible way  i know that we'll have to overcome our doubts and divisions and the determined opposition of powerful special interests before we can truly reform a broken economy and advance opportunity  but i am running for president because we simply cannot afford four more years of an economic philosophy that works for wall street instead of main street  and ends up devastating both  i don't want to wake up in four years to find that more americans fell out of the middle class  and more families lost their savings  i don't want to see that our country failed to invest in our ability to compete  our children's future was mortgaged on another mountain of debt  and our financial markets failed to find a firmer footing  at this defining moment  we have the chance to finally stand up and say  enough is enough  we can do this because americans have done this before  time and again  we've battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  that's why our economy hasn't just been the world's greatest wealth generator   it's bound america together  it's created jobs  and it's made the dream of opportunity a reality for generation after generation of americans  now it falls to us  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking just like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will win florida  we will win this election  and we will change america together "], ["obama1", "it's great to speak to you this morning  i'm sorry that i can't be there  but i did enjoy the opportunity to sit down with president clinton recently in new york  he has helped to create a model for individual responsibility and collective action through the clinton global initiative  cgi brings people together to take on tough  global challenges  in four years  you have made concrete commitments that have affected over   million people in   countries  and i applaud your new commitment to help   million poor children get a healthy meal  it's time for us to come together to get this done  you are meeting at a time of great turmoil for the american economy  we are now confronted with a financial crisis as serious as any we have faced since the great depression  action must be taken to restore confidence in our economy  let me be clear  it's outrageous that we find ourselves in a position where taxpayers must bear the burden for the greed and irresponsibility of wall street and washington  but we also know that a failure to act would have grave consequences for the jobs  and savings  and retirement of the american people  over the last few days  i've been in close contact with secretary paulson and leaders in congress  i've also had the opportunity to speak directly to the american people about what we need to do moving forward  i've laid out several clear principles that i believe must be a part of our response to this crisis  first  we need to set up an independent board  selected by democrats and republicans  to provide oversight and accountability for how and where this money is spent at every step of the way  second  if american taxpayers finance this solution  they should be treated like investors  that means wall street and washington should give every penny of taxpayers' money back once this economy recovers  third  we cannot and will not simply bailout wall street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes  they deserve a plan too  finally   and this is important   the american people should not be spending one dime to reward the same wall street ceos whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess  congressional leaders have made progress in their negotiations  and appear close to a deal that would include these principles  president bush addressed some of these issues last night  and i'm pleased that senator mccain has decided to embrace them too  now is a time to come together   democrats and republicans   in a spirit of cooperation on behalf of the american people  later today  i'll be travelling to washington to offer my help in getting this deal done  then  i'll travel to oxford on friday for the first of our presidential debates  our election is in   days  our economy is in crisis  and our nation is fighting two wars abroad  the american people deserve to hear directly from myself and senator mccain about how we intend to lead our country  the times are too serious to put our campaign on hold  or to ignore the full range of issues that the next president will face  since cgi is about deeds  not just words  let me tell you about four specific commitments that i will make on four issues that cgi has focused on   climate change  poverty  education  and health   if i have the opportunity to serve as president of the united states  here's how i approach these issues  we live in a time when our destinies are shared  the world is more intertwined than at any time in human history  walls that divided old enemies have come down  markets have opened  the spread of information and technology has reduced barriers to opportunity and prosperity  and opened doors to new competition and risk  we have heard this time and again since the end of the cold war  and over the last few weeks  this truth has been reinforced anew  in america  we have seen that there is no dividing line between the ability of folks to live their dreams on main street  and the bottom line of investment banks on wall street  there is a lesson that cuts across this economic crisis  prosperity cannot be sustained if it shuts people out  growth cannot just come from the top down   it must come from the bottom up  with new jobs that pay good wages  and new innovation that creates opportunity across the globe  and in the  st century  we must also recognize that it's not just prosperity that comes from the bottom up  our security is shared as well  the carbon emissions in boston or beijing don't just pollute the immediate atmosphere   they imperil our planet  pockets of extreme poverty in somalia can breed conflict that spills across borders  the child who goes to a radical madrasa outside of karachi can end up endangering the security of my daughters in chicago  a deadly flu that begins in indonesia can find its way to indiana within days  climate change  poverty  extremism  disease  these problems offend our common humanity  they also threaten our common security  you know this  the question is what we do about it  we're not going to face these threats of the future by grasping at the ideas of the past  in many cases  we know what we have to do  we talk about the solutions year after year  this must be the time when we choose not to wait any longer  we must marshal the will  we must see that none of these problems can be dealt with in isolation  nor can we deny one and effectively tackle another  that's why you've come to cgi  because that's what this moment calls us to do  no single issue sits at the crossroads of as many currents as energy  our dependence on oil and gas funds terror and tyranny  it has forced families to pay their wages at the pump  and it puts the future of our planet in peril  this is a security threat  an economic albatross  and a moral challenge of our time  the time to debate whether climate change is manmade has past   it's time  finally  for america to lead  the first commitment that i'll make today is setting a goal of an   percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by   to do our part  we'll implement a cap and trade program so that there's a price for pollution  and resources to transform our energy economy  i've proposed an investment of   billion in alternative energy over ten years  which will create millions of jobs and break the cycle of our addiction to oil  we need to do more than drill  now is the time to develop every form of alternative energy   solar  wind  and biofuels  as well as technologies that can make coal clean and nuclear power safe  we need to raise fuel economy standards  put more plug in hybrid cars on the road  and find new ways to be energy efficient  abroad  the united states must get off the sidelines  we'll reach out to the leaders of the biggest carbon emitting nations and ask them to join a new global energy forum to lay the foundation for the next generation of climate protocols  we'll build an alliance of oil importing nations  and work together to reduce our demand  and break the grip of opec  and as we develop clean energy  we should share technology and innovations with the nations of the world  this effort to confront climate change will be part of our strategy to alleviate poverty  because we know that it is the world's poor who will feel   and who may already be feeling   the affect of a warming planet  if we fail to act  famine could displace hundreds of millions  fueling competition and conflict over basic resources like food and water  we all have a stake in reducing poverty  there is suffering across the globe that doesn't need to be tolerated in the  st century  and it leads to pockets of instability that provide fertile breeding grounds for threats like terror and the smuggling of deadly weapons that cannot be contained by the drawing of a border or the distance of an ocean  these aren't simply disconnected corners of an interconnected world  that is why the second commitment that i will make is embracing the millennium development goals  which aim to cut extreme poverty in half by   this will take more resources from the united states  and as president i will increase our foreign assistance to provide them  but resources must be focused on the right priorities  no one wants to put good money after bad  or ignore the underlying causes at the root of these problems  we shouldn't just settle for a status quo   anywhere   where you can't start a business without paying a bribe  corruption wastes our tax dollars  it also ruins lives  this is a human rights issue  and we need to treat it like one  we shouldn't help those in need without helping them help themselves  that's why i'll partner with the private sector in creating a new fund for small and medium enterprise  so we're investing in ideas that can create growth and jobs in the developing world  above all  we must do our part to see that all children have the basic right to learn  there is nothing more disappointing than a child denied the hope that comes with going to school  and there is nothing more dangerous than a child who is taught to distrust and then to destroy  that's why the third commitment i'll make is working to erase the global primary education gap by   every child   every boy  and every girl   should have the ability to go to school  to ensure that our nation does its part to meet that goal  we need to establish a two billion dollar global education fund  and i look forward to signing the bipartisan education for all act that was first introduced by hillary clinton   a true champion for children  finally  we must continue the progress that's been made to advance the cause of global health  i've been proud to support the pepfar program  i think president bush   and many of you there today   have shown real leadership in the fight against hiv aids  tuberculosis  and malaria  this is a fight that i will continue as president  disease stands in the way of progress on so many fronts  it can condemn populations to poverty  and prevent a child from getting an education  and yet far too many people still die of preventable illnesses  today  i'd like to focus on one  malaria  we have eliminated malaria in the united states  but nearly one million people around the world still die from a mosquito bite every year    percent of the victims are african children under the age of   in africa  a child dies from a mosquito bite every thirty seconds  beyond the devastating human toll  malaria weighs down public health systems  setting back global capacity to fight other disease  so today  i want to join with the global malaria community that is meeting here in new york in making a new commitment  when i am president  we will set the goal of ending all deaths from malaria by   it's time to rid the world of death from a disease that doesn't have to take lives  the united states must lead  and when i am president we will step up our focus on prevention and treatment around the world to get this done  the first project of my small and medium enterprise fund will be investing in the developing world's capacity to meet the demand for   million bednets  we'll also increase access to doctors and nurses through a new program   health infrastructure     that trains medical professionals in countries around the world  and gives them incentives to stay there  and we'll invest in research and development into new vaccines  and ensure that low cost anti malaria drugs are available everywhere  this effort must bring together governments from around the world  it must be a public private partnership that draws on the resources  and ideas  and resilience of business and non profits and faith groups  it must be a cause for countless individuals  and a common goal that unites us all  in short  the effort to eradicate malaria must draw on the spirit that drives not simply the commitments at cgi   but the commitment that is visible everywhere that people go to work to make their communities  their country  and our world a better place  the scale of our challenges may be great  the pace of change may be swift  but we know that it need not be feared  the landscapes of the  st century are still ours to shape  we see the potential for progress every time someone starts a job creating new energy  or an idea carries a community out of poverty  we see it every time a girl walks through the doors of a new school  or a boy lives to see another day because he had a simple net around his bed  these are the dreams that we must make our own  we live in a time when our destinies are shared  but our destinies will be written by us  not for us  now  it falls to us to get to work "], ["obama1", "we meet here at a time of great uncertainty for america  the era of greed and irresponsibility on wall street and in washington has led us to a financial crisis as serious as any we have faced since the great depression  they said they wanted to let the market run free but they let it run wild  and in doing so  they trampled our core values of fairness  balance  and responsibility to one another  everywhere you look  the economic news is troubling  but for so many americans  it isn't really news at all    workers have lost their jobs since january  home values are falling  your paycheck doesn't go as far as it used to  it's never been harder to save or retire  to buy gas or groceries  and if you put it on a credit card  they've probably raised your rates  in so many cities and towns across america  it feels as if the dream that so many generations have fought for is slowly slipping away  last night we had a debate  and on issue after issue   from taxes to health care to the war in iraq   you heard john mccain make the case for more of the same policies that got us into this mess  but just as important as what we heard from john mccain was what we didn't hear  we talked about the economy for forty minutes  and not once did senator mccain talk about the struggles that middle class families are facing every day right here in north carolina and around the country  he defended his plan to give   billion in tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest americans  but he had nothing to say about the fact that wages have flat lined and jobs are being shipped overseas  he railed against some study of bears in montana  but he had nothing to say about the fact that more and more americans can't afford to pay for college  can't afford health care for their families  and can't afford a retirement that is dignified and secure  senator mccain spoke again and again about the need to keep spending   billion a month in iraq  but he said nothing about the need to end this war so that we can invest in good jobs  and rebuild our roads and bridges and broadband lines right here in america  the truth is  through ninety minutes of debating  john mccain had a lot to say about me  but he had nothing to say about you  he didn't even say the words  middle class  not once  you see  i think senator mccain just doesn't get it   he doesn't get that this crisis on wall street hit main street a long time ago  that's why his first response to the greatest fiscal meltdown in generations was to say that the  fundamentals of the economy are strong  that's why he's been shifting positions these last two weeks  looking for a photo op  and trying to figure out what to say and what to do  well north carolina  i know what we need to do  we need to stop giving those tax cuts to corporations and ceos on wall street  and start standing up for families out on main street  we need to turn the page on the failed policies of the last eight years  and finally put working people first  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  we don't need any more out of touch  on your own leadership in washington  we need a president who will change this economy so that it finally works for your family  we need a president who knows that america's strength and leadership abroad depends on the strength of our economy at home  we need a president who will fight for the middle class every single day  and that's exactly what i'll do when i'm president of the united states  i know these are difficult days  but here's what i also know  i know we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  because that's who we are  because that's what we've always done as americans  our nation has faced difficult times before  and at each of those moments  we've risen to meet the challenge because we've never forgotten that fundamental truth   that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  there are many to blame for causing the crisis we are in  and that starts with the speculators on wall street who gamed the system and the regulators in washington who looked the other way  but now that we're here  every american   democrat and republican  ceo and factory worker  has a stake in solving this crisis and saving our financial system from collapse  because if we don't act and act soon  your jobs  your life savings  and your economic security will be put at risk  this administration started off by asking for a blank check to solve this problem  i said absolutely not  it is unacceptable to expect the american people to hand this administration or any administration a   billion check with no conditions and no oversight when a lack of oversight in washington and on wall street is exactly what got us into this mess  if the american people are being asked to pay for the solution to this crisis  then you have a right to make sure that your tax dollars are protected  that's why i've laid out a few a conditions for washington  first  we need to set up an independent board  selected by democrats and republicans  to provide oversight and accountability for how and where this money is spent at every step of the way  second  if american taxpayers are financing this solution  you should be treated like investors  that means that wall street and washington should give you every penny of your money back once this economy recovers  third  we cannot and will not simply bailout wall street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes  they deserve a plan too  and washington needs to feel the same sense of urgency in passing an economic stimulus plan for working families   a plan that would help folks cope with rising food and gas prices  save one million jobs by rebuilding our schools and roads  and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax increases  finally   and this one is important   the american people should not be spending one dime to reward the same wall street ceos whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess  there has been talk that some ceos may refuse to cooperate with this plan if they have to give up their multi million dollar salaries  i cannot imagine a position more selfish and greedy at a time of national crisis  so i will not allow this plan to become a welfare program for wall street executives  now i'm glad that senator mccain has embraced some of these principles  but the john mccain you've heard from over the last few days is a lot different than the john mccain who's been in washington for the last twenty six years  he talks about getting tough on wall street now  but he's been against the common sense rules and regulations that could've stopped this mess for decades  he says he'll take on the corporate lobbyists  but he put seven of the biggest lobbyists in washington in charge of his campaign  and if you think those lobbyists are working day and night to elect my opponent just to put themselves out of business  well i've got a bridge to sell you up in alaska  the truth is  when my opponent first reacted to this crisis by saying that the fundamentals of our economy are strong  he didn't just make a mistake  he revealed an out of touch philosophy he's followed for decades in washington   the idea that if we give more and more to those with the most  prosperity will trickle down to everyone else  the idea that no harm will be done if we let lobbyists shred consumer protections and fight against every regulation as unwise or unnecessary  well what we have seen over the last few weeks is nothing less than the final verdict on this failed philosophy  and i am running for president of the united states because the dreams of the american people cannot be endangered anymore  we have a different way of measuring the fundamentals of our economy  we know that the fundamentals that we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great  that america is a place where you can make it if you try  that everyone should have the chance to live their dreams  i know i wouldn't be standing here today without that promise  and i know that's the promise we must keep once more  when i talk to those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan  i see my grandfather  who signed up after pearl harbor  marched in patton's army  and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill  in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift  i think about my mom  who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree  who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country  and when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down  i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed  these are my heroes  theirs are the stories that shaped me  and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep the promise of america alive as president of the united states  unlike senator mccain  it didn't take a crisis on wall street for me to understand that folks are hurting out on main street  it was two years ago that i introduced legislation to stop mortgage transactions that promoted fraud  risk or abuse  it was one year ago that i called on our treasury secretary and our fed chairman to bring every stakeholder together and find a solution to the subprime mortgage meltdown before it got worse  in march  when john mccain was saying  i'm always for less regulation  i called for a new   st century regulatory framework to restore accountability  transparency  and trust in our financial markets  i believe that our free market has been the engine of america's great progress  it's a market that has created a prosperity that is the envy of the world  and rewarded the innovators and risk takers who have made america a beacon of science  and technology  and discovery  but the american economy has worked in large part because we have guided the market's invisible hand with a higher principle   that america prospers when all americans can prosper  that's the change we need right now  and that's the kind of change i'll bring to washington when i'm president of the united states of america  change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it  but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it  i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas  and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america   jobs just like the   union jobs that at amp t  just created over in goldsboro based on their pledge to return outsourced work to our shores  i will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start ups   that's how we'll grow our economy and create the high wage  high tech jobs of tomorrow  i will cut taxes   cut taxes   for   of all working families  my opponent doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  if you make less than   a year  you will not see your taxes increase one single dime  in fact  i offer three times the tax relief for middle class families as senator mccain does   because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  i will finally keep the promise of affordable  accessible health care for every single american  if you have health care  my plan will lower your premiums  if you don't  you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  and i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most  i will also create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy  we'll tap our natural gas reserves  invest in clean coal technology  and find ways to safely harness nuclear power  i'll help our auto companies re tool  so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america  i'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars  and i'll invest   billion dollars over the next decade in affordable  renewable sources of energy   wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels  an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced and now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education  because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy  i'll recruit an army of new teachers  and pay them higher salaries and give them more support  but in exchange  i will ask for higher standards and more accountability  and we will keep our promise to every young american   if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford a college education  this is the change we need   the kind of bottom up growth and innovation that will advance the american economy by advancing the dreams of all americans  times are hard  i will not pretend that the change we need will come without cost   though i have presented how we can achieve these changes in a fiscally responsible way  i know that we'll have to overcome our doubts and divisions and the determined opposition of powerful special interests before we can truly reform a broken economy and advance opportunity  but i am running for president because we

people cannot be endangered anymore  on friday  we had a debate  and on issue after issue   from taxes to health care to the war in iraq   you heard john mccain make the case for more of the same policies that got us into this mess  but just as important as what we heard from john mccain was what we didn't hear  we talked about the economy for forty minutes  and not once did senator mccain talk about the struggles that middle class families are facing every day right here in north carolina and around the country  he defended his plan to give   billion in tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest americans  but he had nothing to say about the fact that wages have flat lined and jobs are being shipped overseas  he railed against some study of bears in montana  but he had nothing to say about the fact that more and more americans can't afford to pay for college  can't afford health care for their families  and can't afford a retirement that is dignified and secure  senator mccain spoke again and again about the need to keep spending   billion a month in iraq  but he said nothing about the need to end this war so that we can invest in good jobs  and rebuild our roads and bridges and broadband lines right here in america  the truth is  through ninety minutes of debating  john mccain had a lot to say about me  but he had nothing to say about you  he didn't even say the words  middle class  not once  you see  i think senator mccain just doesn't get it   he doesn't get that this crisis on wall street hit main street a long time ago  that's why his first response to the greatest fiscal meltdown in generations was to say that the  fundamentals of the economy are strong  that's why he's been shifting positions these last two weeks  looking for a photo op  and trying to figure out what to say and what to do  well i know what we need to do  we need to stop giving those tax cuts to corporations and ceos on wall street  and start standing up for families out on main street  we need to turn the page on the failed policies of the last eight years  and finally put working people first  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  we don't need any more out of touch  on your own leadership in washington  we need a president who will change this economy so that it finally works for your family  we need a president who will fight for the middle class every single day  and that's exactly what i'll do when i'm president of the united states  we have a different way of measuring the fundamentals of our economy  we know that the fundamentals that we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great  that america is a place where you can make it if you try  that everyone should have the chance to live their dreams  i know i wouldn't be standing here today without that promise  and i know that's the promise we must keep once more  when i talk to those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan  i see my grandfather  who signed up after pearl harbor  marched in patton's army  and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill  in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift  i think about my mom  who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree  who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country  and when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down  i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed  these are my heroes  theirs are the stories that shaped me  and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep the promise of america alive as president of the united states  that's the change we need right now  and that's the kind of change i'll bring to washington when i'm president of the united states of america  change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it  but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it  i will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start ups   that's how we'll grow our economy and create the high wage  high tech jobs of tomorrow  i will cut taxes   cut taxes   for   of all working families  my opponent doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  if you make less than   a year  you will not see your taxes increase one single dime  in fact  i offer three times the tax relief for middle class families as senator mccain does   because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  i will finally keep the promise of affordable  accessible health care for every single american  if you have health care  my plan will lower your premiums  if you don't  you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  and i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most  i will also create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy  we'll tap our natural gas reserves  invest in clean coal technology  and find ways to safely harness nuclear power  i'll help our auto companies re tool and get the loans they need so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in detroit  right here in michigan  right here in the united states of america  i'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars  and i'll invest   billion dollars over the next decade in affordable  renewable sources of energy   wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels  an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced and now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education  because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy  i'll recruit an army of new teachers  and pay them higher salaries and give them more support  but in exchange  i will ask for higher standards and more accountability  and we will keep our promise to every young american   if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford a college education  this is the change we need   the kind of bottom up growth and innovation that will advance the american economy by advancing the dreams of all americans  times are hard  i will not pretend that the change we need will come without cost   though i have presented how we can achieve these changes in a fiscally responsible way  i know that we'll have to overcome our doubts and divisions and the determined opposition of powerful special interests before we can truly reform a broken economy and advance opportunity  but i am running for president because we simply cannot afford four more years of an economic philosophy that works for wall street instead of main street  and ends up devastating both  i don't want to wake up in four years to find that more americans fell out of the middle class  and more families lost their savings  i don't want to see that our country failed to invest in our ability to compete  our children's future was mortgaged on another mountain of debt  and our financial markets failed to find a firmer footing  at this defining moment  we have the chance to finally stand up and say  enough is enough  we can do this because americans have done this before  time and again  we've battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  that's why our economy hasn't just been the world's greatest wealth generator   it's bound america together  it's created jobs  and it's made the dream of opportunity a reality for generation after generation of americans  now it falls to us  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking just like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will win michigan  we will win this election  and we will change america together "], ["obama1", "we meet here at a time of great uncertainty for america  the era of greed and irresponsibility on wall street and in washington has led us to a financial crisis as serious as any we have faced since the great depression  they said they wanted to let the market run free but they let it run wild  and they trampled our american values of fairness  balance  and responsibility to one another  now  because of speculators who gamed the system and regulators who looked the other way  your jobs  your life savings  and the stability of our entire economy are at risk  we have been left with no good options  and today  democrats and republicans in washington have agreed on an emergency rescue plan that is our best and only way to prevent an economic catastrophe  it's a plan that's improved a good deal over the last week  this administration started off by asking for a blank check to solve this problem  i said absolutely not  i said it was unacceptable to expect the american people to hand this administration or any administration a   billion check with no conditions and no oversight when a lack of oversight in washington and on wall street is exactly what got us into this mess  if the american people are being asked to help solve this crisis  then you have a right to make sure that your tax dollars are protected  and so i laid out a few a conditions for washington  i said we needed an independent board to provide oversight and accountability for how and where this money is spent at every step of the way  i said that if american taxpayers are financing this solution  then you should be treated like investors   you should get every penny of your tax dollars back once this economy recovers  and wall street should foot the bill  i said that we cannot and will not simply bailout wall street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes  they deserve a plan too  and finally  i said that i would not allow this plan to become a welfare program for the wall street executives whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess  thanks to the hard work of democrats and republicans  the proposal we have today includes these taxpayer protections  and if i am president  i will review the entire plan on the day i take office to make sure that it is working to save our economy and that you get your money back  but let me be absolutely clear about one thing  at a time like this   a time when   workers have lost their jobs since january  when home values are falling and paychecks are flat  when it's never been harder to save or retire  to buy gas or groceries  at a time when americans are working so much harder for so much less  the fact that you are being called upon to help clean up wall street's mess is an outrage  it is an outrage that we're spending this money when we could be investing in affordable health care  or renewable energy  or better schools for our children  it is an outrage that we are in this mess and we are here to make sure that it never happens again  we did not arrive at this moment by some accident of history  this was not a normal part of the business cycle  this was not just a few bad apples on wall street  this crisis is a direct result of a philosophy that the folks running washington have been following for decades  it's a philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  a philosophy that says even common sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise  a philosophy that lets lobbyists shred consumer protections and put the needs of special interests ahead of working people  and what we have seen over the last few weeks is the final verdict on this failed philosophy  it is time to turn the page  that is the choice in this election  because senator mccain has followed this philosophy for twenty six years in washington and now he's running to give us another four  he's fought against common sense regulations for decades  he's called for less regulation twenty times just this year  and he said in a recent interview that he thought de regulation has actually helped grow our economy  senator  what economy are you talking about  at a time when we're putting hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars on the line  senator mccain still wants to spend   billion on tax breaks for the biggest corporations in america  he wants to give a   tax break to the average fortune   ceo  but not one dime of relief to more than   million middle class americans  he likes to talk about how he'll take on the corporate lobbyists in washington  but he put seven of them in charge of his campaign  and if you think those lobbyists are working day and night to elect my opponent just to put themselves out of business  well i've got a bridge to sell you up in alaska  you see  senator mccain just doesn't get it   he doesn't get that this crisis on wall street hit main street a long time ago  that's why his first response to the greatest fiscal meltdown in generations was to say that the  fundamentals of the economy are strong  and why he didn't say the words  middle class  once in an entire  minute debate  i read the other day that senator mccain likes to gamble  he likes to roll those dice  and that's ok  i enjoy a little friendly game of poker myself every now and then  but one thing i know is this   we can't afford to gamble on four more years of the same disastrous economic policies we've had for the last eight  i know that when senator mccain says he wants to bring the same kind of deregulation to our health care system that he helped bring to our banking system   his words   well  that's a bet we can't afford  we can't afford to roll the dice by privatizing social security  and wagering the nest egg of millions of americans on wall street  we can't afford to gamble on more of the same trickle down philosophy that showers tax breaks on big corporations and the wealthiest few  we've tried that  it doesn't work  with our economy at risk  and our future in the balance  the greatest risk in this election is to repeat the same mistakes of the past  we can't take a chance on the same losing game  we need a president who will change this economy so that it finally works for your family  we need a president who will fight for the middle class every single day  and that's exactly what i'll do when i'm president of the united states  we have a different way of measuring the fundamentals of our economy  we know that the fundamentals that we use to measure economic strength are whether we

united states of america  i will fight every day of this campaign and every day of my presidency to make sure a crisis like this never  ever happens again  that means taking on the lobbyists and special interests in washington  that means taking on the greed and corruption on wall street  that means putting in place the rules of the road and common sense regulations for our finance system that i've been calling for since last march   regulations that would make our markets open  honest  and transparent  that's the change we need  and now that we're fixing the mess on wall street  we need to move with the same sense of urgency to help families on main street  we don't just need a plan for bankers and investors  we need a plan for autoworkers and teachers and small business owners  i have said it before and i'll say it again  we need to pass an economic stimulus plan right now for working families   a plan that will help folks cope with rising food and gas prices  save one million jobs by rebuilding our schools and roads  and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax increases  a plan that would extend expiring unemployment benefits for those americans who've lost their jobs and cannot find new ones  that's the change we need  change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it  but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it  as president  i will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start ups   that's how we'll grow our economy and create the high wage  high tech jobs of tomorrow  i will cut taxes   cut taxes   for   of all working families  my opponent doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  if you make less than   a

not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  and i

and we will change america together "], ["obama1", "this morning   like so many others over the last few months   we woke up to some very sobering news about our economy  over the course of a few hours  the failure to pass the economic rescue plan in washington led to the single largest decline of the stock market in two decades  over one trillion dollars of wealth was lost by the time the markets closed on monday  and it wasn't just the wealth of a few ceos or wall street executives  the  ks and retirement accounts that millions count on for their family's future are now smaller  the state pension funds of teachers and government employees lost billions upon billions of dollars  hardworking americans who invested their nest egg to watch it grow are now watching it disappear  but while the decline of the stock market is devastating  the consequences of the credit crisis that caused it will be even worse if we do not act and act immediately  because of the housing crisis  we are now in a very dangerous situation where financial institutions across this country are afraid to lend money  if all that meant was the failure of a few big banks on wall street  it would be one thing  but that's not what it means  what it means is that if we do not act  it will be harder for you to get a mortgage for your home or the loans you need to buy a car or send your children to college  what it means is that businesses won't be able to get the loans they need to open new factories  or hire more workers  or make payroll for the workers they have  what it means is that thousands of businesses could close  millions of jobs could be lost  a long and painful recession could follow  let me be perfectly clear  the fact that we are in this mess is an outrage  it's an outrage because we did not get here by accident  this was not a normal part of the business cycle  this was not the actions of a few bad apples  this financial crisis is a direct result of the greed and irresponsibility that has dominated washington and wall street for years  it's the result of speculators who gamed the system  regulators who looked the other way  and lobbyists who bought their way into our government  it's the result of an economic philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  a philosophy that views even the most common sense regulations as unwise and unnecessary  and this economic catastrophe is the final verdict on this failed philosophy   a philosophy that we cannot afford to continue  but while there is plenty of blame to go around and many in washington and on wall street who deserve it  all of us now have a responsibility to solve this crisis because it affects the financial well being of every single american  there will be time to punish those who set this fire  but now is the moment for us to come together and put the fire out  this is one of those defining moments when the american people are looking to washington for leadership  it is not a time for politics  it is not a time for partisanship  it is not a time to figure out how to take credit or where to lay blame  it is not a time for politicians to concern themselves with the next election  it is a time for all of us to concern ourselves with the future of the country we love  this is a time for action  i know that many of you are feeling anxiety right now   about your jobs  about your homes  about your life savings  but i also know this   i know that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  because that's who we are  because this is the united states of america  this is a nation that has faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we have risen to meet these challenges   not as democrats  not as republicans  but as americans  with resolve  with confidence  with that fundamental belief that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  that's who we are  and that's the country we need to be right now  this is no longer just a wall street crisis   it's an american crisis  and it's the american economy that needs this rescue plan  i understand why people would be skeptical when this president asks for a blank check to solve a problem  i've spent most of my time in washington being skeptical of this administration  and this time was no different  that's why over a week ago  i demanded that this plan include specific proposals to protect american taxpayer   protections that the administration eventually agreed to  as well as democrats and republicans in congress  first  i said we needed an independent board to provide oversight and accountability for how and where this money is spent at every step of the way  second  i said that we cannot help banks on wall street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes  they deserve a plan too  third  i said that i would not allow this plan to become a welfare program for the wall street executives whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess  and finally  i said that if american taxpayers are financing this solution  then you should be treated like investors   you should get every penny of your tax dollars back once this economy recovers  this last part is important  because it's been the most misunderstood and poorly communicated aspect of this entire plan  this is not a plan to just hand over   billion of your money to a few banks on wall street  if this is executed the right way  then the government will temporarily purchase the bad assets of our financial institutions so that they can start lending again  and then sell those assets once the markets settle down and the economy recovers  if this is managed correctly  we will hopefully get most or all of our money back  or possibly even turn a profit on the government's investment   every penny of which will go directly back to you  the investor  and if we do have losses  i've proposed to institute a financial stability fee on the entire financial services industry so that wall street foots the bill   not the american taxpayer  i've also said that if i'm president  i will review the entire plan on the day i take office to make sure that it is working to save our economy and that you are getting your money back  even with all these taxpayer protections  i know that this plan is not perfect or fool proof  no matter how well we manage the government's investments under this plan  we are still putting taxpayer dollars at risk  i know that there are democrats and republicans in congress who have legitimate concerns about this  and i know there are many americans who share those concerns  but i also know that we can't afford not to act  both parties are close to accepting this plan  and over the next few hours and days  we should seek out any new ideas that might get this done  this morning  i proposed one such idea that might increase bipartisan support for this plan and shore up our economy at the same time  expanding federal deposit insurance for families and small businesses across america who have invested their money in our banks  the majority of american families should rest assured that the deposits they have in our banks of up to   are still guaranteed by the federal government  that guarantee is more than adequate for most families  but it is insufficient for many small businesses to meet their payroll  buy their supplies  and create new jobs  the current insurance limit of   was set   years ago and has not been adjusted for inflation  i've proposed raising the fdic limit to     a step that would boost small businesses  make our banking system more secure  and help restore confidence by reassuring families that their money is safe  that's one idea  if there are others that can help shore up support for this plan and shore up our economy  i encourage democrats and republicans to offer them  but we must act and we must act now  we cannot have another day like yesterday  we cannot risk another week or another month where american businesses are afraid to extend credit and lend money  that is not an option for this country  for the rest of today and as long as it takes  i will continue to reach out to leaders in both parties and do whatever i can to help pass a rescue plan  to the democrats and republicans who opposed this plan yesterday  i say   step up to the plate and do what's right for this country  and to all americans  i say this   if i am president of the united states  this rescue plan will not be the end of what we do to strengthen this economy   it will only be the beginning  people have asked whether the size of this plan  together with the weakening economy  means that the next president will have to scale back his agenda and some of his proposals  the answer is both yes and no  with less money flowing into the treasury  it is likely that some useful programs or policies that i've proposed on the campaign trail may need to be delayed  and i've said that as president  i will go through the federal budget  line by line  eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less  but there are certain investments in our future that we cannot delay precisely because our economy is in turmoil  you can always put off giving your house a new paint job or renovating your kitchen  but when your roof is crumbling or your heater goes  you realize that these are long term investments you need to make right away  the same is true of our economy  we cannot wait to help americans keep up with rising costs and shrinking paychecks by giving our workers a middle class tax cut  we cannot wait to relieve the burden of crushing health care costs on families  businesses  and our entire economy  we cannot wait to create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our roads and our bridges and investing in the renewable sources of energy that will stop us from sending   billion a year to tyrants and dictators for their oil  and we cannot wait to educate the next generation of americans with the skills and knowledge they need to compete with any workers  anywhere in the world  those are the priorities we cannot delay  as soon as we pass this rescue plan  we need to move with the same sense of urgency to rescue the families on main street who are struggling every day to pay their bills and keep their jobs  i've said it before and i'll say it again  we need to pass an economic stimulus plan that will help folks cope with rising food and gas prices  save one million jobs by rebuilding our schools and roads  and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax increases  a plan that would extend expiring unemployment benefits for those americans who've lost their jobs and cannot find new ones  beyond this immediate stimulus that i've called on both parties and the president to pass  we need an economic agenda to restore opportunity for americans and prosperity to america  we need policies that will grow this economy from main street to wall street and everywhere in between   so that the  st century is another american century  so that we're not borrowing debt from china and buying oil from saudi arabia  so that the jobs of the future don't go to better educated workers in india and the cars of the future aren't made in japan  so that we can leave a legacy of greater opportunity to our children and their children  that is how we will emerge from this crisis stronger and more prosperous than we were before  and that is what i will do as president of the united states  i will begin by reforming our tax code so that it doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it  but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it  i will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start ups  so that we can grow our economy and create the high wage  high tech jobs of tomorrow  i will cut taxes   cut taxes   for   of all workers and their families  and if you make less than   a year  you will not see your taxes increase one single dime   because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  i will reform our health care system to relieve families  businesses  and the entire economy from the crushing cost of health care by investing in new technology and preventative care  if you have health care  my plan will lower your premiums  if you don't  you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  and i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most  to create new jobs  i'll invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure   our roads  schools  and bridges  we'll rebuild our outdated electricity grid and build new broadband lines to connect america  and i'll create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy  we'll tap our natural gas reserves  invest in clean coal technology  and find ways to safely harness nuclear power  i'll help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here the united states of america  i'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars  and i'll invest   billion dollars over the next decade in affordable  renewable sources of energy   wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels  an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced and if i am president  i will meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education  because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy  i'll invest in early childhood education  i'll recruit an army of new teachers  and pay them higher salaries and give them more support  but in exchange  i will ask for higher standards and more accountability  and we will keep our promise to every young american   if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford a college education  finally  i will modernize our outdated financial regulations and put in the place the common sense rules of the road i've been calling for since march   rules that will keep our market free  fair  and honest  rules that will make sure wall street can never get away with the stunts that caused this crisis again  and i will take power away from the corporate lobbyists who think they can stand in the way of these reforms  i've done it in illinois  i've done it washington  and i will do it again as president  these are the changes and reforms that we need  bottom up growth that will create opportunity for every american  investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the  st century  common sense regulations for our financial system that will prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again  i won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever  we are all in this together  what this crisis has taught us is that at the end of the day  there is no real separation between main street and wall street  there is only the road we're traveling on as americans   and we will rise or fall on that journey as one nation  as one people  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  i believe that this is one of those moments  i know that many of you are anxious about your future and the future of this country  i realize that you are cynical and fed up with politics  i understand that you are disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask you to believe   believe in this country and your ability to change it  i ask you what has been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history   what was asked at the beginning of the greatest financial crisis this nation has ever endured  in his first fireside chat  franklin roosevelt told his fellow americans that  there is an element in the readjustment of our financial system more important than currency  more important than gold  and that is the confidence of the people themselves  confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carrying out our plan  let us unite in banishing fear  together  we cannot fail  america  together  we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  or pay their bills at the end of the month  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves  now is the time to make them proud of what we did here  let's give our children the future they deserve  and let's act with confidence and courage to show the world that at this moment  in this election  the united states of america is still the last  best hope of earth  thank you nevada  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "we meet here at a time of great uncertainty  our economy is in crisis  the dreams of so many americans are at risk  and the american people are waiting for leadership from washington  on monday  over the course of a few hours  the failure to pass the economic rescue plan in the house led to the single largest decline of the stock market in two decades  over one trillion dollars of wealth was lost by the time the markets closed  and it wasn't just the wealth of a few ceos or wall street executives  the  ks and retirement accounts that millions count on for their family's future are now smaller  the state pension funds of teachers and government employees lost billions upon billions of dollars  hardworking americans who invested their nest egg to watch it grow are now watching it disappear  but while the decline of the stock market is devastating  the consequences of the credit crisis that caused it will be even worse if we do not act and act immediately  because of the housing crisis  we are now in a very dangerous situation where financial institutions across this country are afraid to lend money  if all that meant was the failure of a few big banks on wall street  it would be one thing  but that's not what it means  what it means is that if we do not act  it will be harder for you to get a mortgage for your home or the loans you need to buy a car or send your children to college  what it means is that businesses won't be able to get the loans they need to open new factories  or hire more workers  or make payroll for the workers they have  thousands of businesses could close  millions of jobs could be lost  a long and painful recession could follow  let me be perfectly clear  the fact that we are in this mess is an outrage  it's an outrage because we did not get here by accident  this was not a normal part of the business cycle  this was not the actions of a few bad apples  this financial crisis is a direct result of the greed and irresponsibility that has dominated washington and wall street for years  it's the result of speculators who gamed the system  regulators who looked the other way  and lobbyists who bought their way into our government  it's the result of an economic philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  a philosophy that views even the most common sense regulations as unwise and unnecessary  and this crisis is the final verdict on this failed philosophy   a philosophy that we cannot afford to continue  but while there is plenty of blame to go around and many in washington and on wall street who deserve it  all of us now have a responsibility to solve this crisis because it affects the financial well being of every single american  there will be time to punish those who set this fire  but now is the moment for us to come together and put the fire out  i know that many of you are feeling anxiety right now   about your jobs  about your homes  about your life savings  but i also know this   i know that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  because that's who we are  because this is the united states of america  this is a nation that has faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we have risen to meet these challenges   not as democrats  not as republicans  but as americans  with resolve  with confidence  with that fundamental belief that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  that's who we are  and that's the country we need to be right now  this is not just a wall street crisis   it's an american crisis  and it's the american economy that needs this rescue plan  i understand why people would be skeptical when this president asks for a blank check to solve a problem  i've spent most of my time in washington being skeptical of this administration  and this time was no different  that's why over a week ago  i demanded that this plan include specific proposals to protect the american taxpayer   protections that the administration eventually agreed to  as well as democrats and republicans in congress  first  i said we needed an independent board to provide oversight and accountability for how and where this money is spent at every step of the way  second  i said that we cannot help banks on wall street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes  they deserve a plan too  third  i said that i would not allow this plan to become a welfare program for the wall street executives whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess  and finally  i said that if american taxpayers are financing this solution  then you should be treated like investors   you should get every penny of your tax dollars back once this economy recovers  this last part is important  because it's been the most misunderstood and poorly communicated part of this plan  this is not a plan to just hand over   billion of your money to a few banks  if this is managed correctly  we will hopefully get most or all of our money back  or possibly even turn a profit on the government's investment   every penny of which will go directly back to you  the investor  the rescue plan now includes those four principles  it also includes a proposal i made yesterday morning to expand federal deposit insurance for families and small businesses across america who have invested their money in our banks  this will boost small businesses  make our banking system more secure  and help restore confidence by reassuring families that their money is safe  even with all these taxpayer protections  this plan is not perfect  democrats and republicans in congress have legitimate concerns about it  i know many americans share those concerns  but it is clear that this is what we must do right now to prevent a crisis from turning into a catastrophe  that's why i've been reaching out to leaders in both parties to do whatever i can to help pass this plan  that's why i'll be flying back to washington today to cast my vote to safeguard the american economy  and to the democrats and republicans who have opposed this plan  i say   step up to the plate and do what's right for the country  because the time to act is now  i know many americans are wondering what happens next  passing this bill will not be the end of our work to strengthen our economy   it's just the beginning of a long  hard road ahead  so let me tell you exactly how i'll move forward as president  from the moment i take office  my top priority will be to do everything i can to make sure that your tax dollars are protected  i will demand a full review of this financial rescue plan to make sure that it is working for you  if you   the american taxpayer   are not getting your money back  then we will change how this program is being managed  if need be  we will send new legislation to congress to make sure that taxpayers are protected in line with the principles that i have put forward  you should expect nothing less from washington  if we do have losses  i've proposed a financial stability fee on the financial services industry so wall street foots the bill   not the american taxpayer  and as i modernize the financial system to create new rules of the road to prevent another crisis  we will continue this fee to build up a reserve so that if this happens again  it will be the money contributed by banks that's put at risk  this will only work if there is real enforcement and real accountability  and that starts with presidential leadership  so let me be very clear  when i am president  financial institutions will do their part and pay their share  and american taxpayers will never again have to put their money on the line to pay for the greed and irresponsibility of wall street  that's a pledge that i'll make to you today  and it's one that i'll keep as president of the united states  accountability must start with this rescue plan  but it cannot end there  across wisconsin   and across the country   families are sitting down at the kitchen table and making hard choices  you're planning for your future in tough times  you're squeezing just a little bit more out of next month's paycheck so you can pay next month's bills  it's time for washington to do the same  we cannot mortgage our children's future on a mountain of debt  it's time to put an end to the run away spending and the record deficits   it's not how you would run your family budget  and it must not be how washington handles your tax dollars  it's time to return to the fiscal responsibility and pay as you go budgeting that we had in the  s  many in congress have been fighting for these commonsense principles  and i will be a president who supports them and makes sure they succeed  that's why i'm not going to stand here and simply tell you what i'm going to spend   i'm going to start by telling you how we're going to save when i am president  i will go through the entire federal budget  page by page  line by line  and eliminate the programs that don't work and aren't needed  we should start by ending a war in iraq that is costing us   billion a month while the iraqi government sits on a   billion surplus  we should stop sending   billion a year in overpayments to insurance companies for medicare  and go after tens of billions of dollars in medicare and medicaid fraud  we need to stop sending three billion a year to banks that provide student loans the government could provide for less  and we can end the hundreds of millions a year in subsidies to agribusiness that can survive just fine without your tax dollars  and use some of the money to help struggling family farmers  that's what i'll do as president  and we can't stop there  we lose   billion every year because corporations set up mailboxes offshore so they can avoid paying a dime of taxes in america  in the senate  i worked across the aisle to crack down on these schemes  and as president  i will shut down those offshore tax havens and all those corporate loopholes once and for all  you shouldn't have to pay higher taxes because some big corporation cut corners to avoid paying theirs  all of us have a responsibility to pay our fair share  that's accountability  and that's what we'll have when i'm president  as for the programs we do need  i will make them work better and cost less  i will create a high performance team of experts that evaluates every agency and every office based on how well they're serving the american taxpayer  i will save billions of dollars by cutting private contractors and improving management and oversight of the hundreds of billions of dollars our government spends on contracts  and i will finally end the abuse of no bid contracts once and for all   the days of sweetheart deals for halliburton will be over when i'm in the white house  make no mistake  we need to end an era in washington where accountability has been absent  oversight has been overlooked  and your tax dollars have been turned over to wealthy ceos and well connected corporations  you need leadership that you can trust to work for you   not for the special interests who have had their thumb on the scale  and together  we will tell the washington lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda are over  they have not funded this campaign  they won't work in my white house  and they won't drown out the voices of the american people when i'm president  now  people have asked whether the size of this rescue plan  together with the weakening economy  means that the next president will have to scale back his agenda and some of his proposals  the answer is yes and no  with less money flowing into the treasury  some useful programs or policies that i've proposed on the campaign trail may need to be delayed  but there are certain investments in our future that we cannot delay precisely because our economy is in turmoil  you can always put off giving your house a new paint job or renovating your kitchen  but when your roof is crumbling or your heater goes  you realize that these are long term investments you need to make right away  the same is true of our economy  we cannot wait to help americans keep up with rising costs and shrinking paychecks by giving our workers a middle class tax cut  we cannot wait to relieve the burden of crushing health care costs  we cannot wait to create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our roads and our bridges and investing in the renewable sources of energy that will stop us from sending   billion a year to tyrants and dictators for their oil  and we cannot wait to educate the next generation of americans with the skills and knowledge they need to compete with any workers  anywhere in the world  those are the priorities we cannot delay  as soon as we pass this rescue plan  we need to move with the same sense of urgency to rescue families on main street who are struggling to pay their bills and keep their jobs  i've said it before and i'll say it again  we need to pass an economic stimulus plan that will help folks cope with rising food and gas prices  save one million jobs by rebuilding our schools and roads  and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax increases  a plan that would extend expiring unemployment benefits for those americans who've lost their jobs and cannot find new ones  beyond this stimulus  we need an economic agenda to restore opportunity for americans and prosperity to america  so that we're not borrowing debt from china and buying oil from saudi arabia  so that the jobs of the future don't go to better educated workers in india and the cars of the future aren't made in japan  so that we can leave a legacy of greater opportunity to our children and their children  that is how we will emerge from this crisis stronger and more prosperous than we were before  and that is what i will do as president of the united states  i will begin by reforming our tax code so that it doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it  but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it  i will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start ups  so that we can grow our economy and create the high wage  high tech jobs of tomorrow  i will cut taxes   cut taxes   for   of all workers and their families  and if you make less than   a year  you will not see your taxes increase one single dime   because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  i will reform our health care system to relieve families  businesses  and the entire economy from the crushing cost of health care by investing in new technology and preventative care  if you have health care  my plan will lower your premiums  if you don't  you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  and i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most  to create new jobs  i'll invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure   our roads  schools  and bridges  we'll rebuild our outdated electricity grid and build new broadband lines to connect america  and i'll create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy  we'll tap our natural gas reserves  invest in clean coal  and find ways to safely harness nuclear power  i'll help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here the united states  i'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars  and i'll invest   billion dollars over the next decade in affordable  renewable sources of energy   wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels  an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced and if i am president  i will meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education  because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy  i'll invest in early childhood education  i'll recruit an army of new teachers  and pay them higher salaries and give them more support  but in exchange  i will ask for higher standards and more accountability  and we will keep our promise to every young american   if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford a college education  finally  i will modernize our outdated financial regulations and put in the place the common sense rules of the road i've been calling for since march   rules that will keep our market free  fair  and honest  rules that will make sure wall street can never get away with the stunts that caused this crisis again  these are the changes and reforms that we need  bottom up growth that will create opportunity for every american  investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy

them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves  we can do this  americans have done this before  some of us had grandparents or parents that said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  together  we cannot fail  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking just like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will win wisconsin  we will win this election  and we will change america together  thank you la crosse  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "the events of the last few weeks have shown us that the stakes in this election could not be higher  we are in a financial crisis as serious as any we've faced since the great depression  in recent weeks  we've seen our financial landscape shift before our eyes  we've seen a growing credit crunch put new pressures on banks  businesses  and families  and on monday  we saw the single largest decline of the stock market in two decades   a decline that threatens not just the wealth of wall street executives  but the life savings  jobs  and economic security of millions of ordinary americans  everywhere you look  the economic news is troubling  but for so many of you here in michigan  it isn't really news at all    jobs have been lost since the year began  including about   in michigan  the unemployment rate here in grand rapids and other parts of this state is nearly double what it is across this country  and a new jobs report is coming out tomorrow that experts predict will show our ninth straight month of job loss  nine straight months of job loss  yet  just the other week  john mccain said the  fundamentals of the economy are strong  well  i don't know what yardstick senator mccain uses  but where i come from  there's nothing more fundamental than a job  and when we're losing jobs month after month after month  when good  hard working americans who've done everything right watch their dreams slip away  the fundamentals of our economy are not strong  and it's time we had a president who understands that  but it's not just jobs  home values are falling  wages are flat lining  and the cost of everything from gas to groceries is going up and up  these are the quiet storms that our families have been facing for months if not years  and these are the storms that will only grow worse if we do not act   and act now   to pass the rescue plan that's before congress  democrats and republicans in the house need to do what the senate did last night and do what's right for this country  if the financial markets collapse  and loans are not available  businesses  large and small  will follow  it's your jobs  your savings  your ability to pursue your dreams for your children that are at risk  that's why we have to act  that's why we have to set aside the politics of the moment and exercise something we haven't seen in washington lately   responsibility  now  let me be perfectly clear  the fact that we are in this mess is an outrage  it's an outrage because we did not get here by accident  this was not a normal part of the business cycle  this did not happen because of a few bad apples  this financial crisis is a direct result of the greed and irresponsibility that has dominated washington and wall street for years  it's the result of speculators who gamed the system  regulators who looked the other way  and lobbyists who bought their way into our government  it's the result of an economic philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  a philosophy that views even the most common sense regulations as unwise and unnecessary  well  this crisis is nothing less than a final verdict on this failed philosophy   and it's a philosophy i'm running for president to end  that's what this election is all about  because despite my opponent's best efforts to make you think otherwise  this is the philosophy he's embraced during his twenty six years in washington  over the past few days  he's talked a lot about getting tough on wall street  but over the past few decades  he's fought against the very rules of the road that could've stopped this mess  he says he'll take on corporate lobbyists now  but he put seven of the biggest lobbyists in washington in charge of his campaign  and if you think those lobbyists are working day and night to elect him just to put themselves out of business  well i've got a bridge to sell you up in alaska  the truth is  my opponent's philosophy isn't just wrong headed  it reveals how out of touch he really is  how else could he offer   billion in tax cuts for big corporations at a time like this  how else could he propose giving the average fortune   ceo a   tax cut at a time when millions of americans are struggling to pay their bills  how else could he come up with an economic plan that leaves out more than   million middle class families at the very moment they need help most  senator mccain just doesn't get it  well  michigan  you and i do get it  that's why we're here today  we know the next four years don't have to look like the last eight  we know we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  because that's who we are  because this is america  we're a nation that's faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we've risen to meet these challenges because we've never forgotten that fundamental truth   that here  in this country  our destiny is not written for us  it's written by us  it's time to take our destiny into our own hands and reclaim our economic future  part of what that means is passing the rescue plan that's before congress  i know many people were outraged when this administration initially asked the american people to sign a blank check to solve this crisis  i was outraged too  that's why i fought to make sure the rescue plan protects taxpayers  provides oversight and accountability  helps struggling homeowners stay in their homes  and doesn't reward the wall street executives whose greed and irresponsibility led us to this perilous moment  while these taxpayer protections are now part of the rescue plan  this plan still isn't perfect  but it's what we must do to prevent a crisis from turning into a catastrophe  but understand  even with this plan  we may face a long and difficult road to recovery  that is why  if i'm president  passing this rescue plan won't be the end of what we do to strengthen our economy  it'll be the beginning  it'll be the beginning of a long term rescue plan for our middle class   a plan that will create millions of new jobs  help families keep up with rising costs  relieve the burden of crushing health care costs  and educate the next generation of americans with the skills and knowledge to compete with any workers  anywhere in the world  now  people have asked whether the size of the plan that congress is voting on  together with the weakening economy  means that the next president will have to scale back his agenda and some of his proposals  and there's no doubt that some programs or policies that i've proposed on the campaign trail may require more time to achieve  but i reject the idea that you can't build a strong middle class at a time when our economy is weak  i believe that building a strong middle class is the key to making our economy strong  and that's what we'll do when i'm president of the united states  to create new jobs  we'll not only invest in rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges  and our outdated electricity grid   we'll strengthen the auto industry that built the middle class in this country  a number of auto companies are showing real leadership in building fuel efficient cars  and i applaud them for it  but i refuse to accept that washington has to stand idly by while foreign automakers outpace us  i'm running for president to make sure the cars of the future are made in the same place they've always been made   right here in michigan  i'll be a president who finally keeps the promise that's made year after year by providing the funding our automakers need to retool their factories and make fuel efficient and alternative fuel cars and trucks  and as we fight to reverse the decline in manufacturing over the last eight years  we'll also bring manufacturing into the  st century by building an american green energy sector  we'll invest   billion over the next decade in affordable  renewable sources of energy   wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels  an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced  because the fight for american manufacturing is the fight for america's future   and i believe that's a fight this country will win  i will also reform our tax code so that it doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it  but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it  i will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start ups  so that we can grow our economy and create the high wage  high tech jobs of tomorrow  i will cut taxes   cut taxes   for   of all working families  my opponent doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  if you make less than   a year  you will not see your taxes increase one single dime  in fact  i offer three times the tax relief for middle class families as senator mccain does   because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  i will reform our health care system so we can relieve families  businesses  and our economy from the crushing cost of health care by investing in new technology and preventative care  if you have health care  my plan will lower your premiums  if you don't  you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves  and we'll reduce costs for business and their workers by picking up the tab for some of the most expensive illnesses and conditions   because that's how we'll make our companies more competitive in the  st century  and if i am president  i will meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education  because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy  i'll invest in early childhood education  i'll recruit an army of new teachers  and pay them higher salaries and give them more support  but in exchange  i will ask for higher standards and more accountability  and we will keep our promise to every young american   if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford a college education  finally  i will modernize our outdated financial regulations and put in place the common sense rules of the road i've been calling for since march   rules that will keep our market free  fair  and honest  rules that will restore accountability and responsibility in the boardroom  and make sure wall street can never get away with the stunts that caused this crisis again  but just as we demand accountability on wall street  we must also demand it in washington  because we cannot afford another four years of the kind of deficits we've seen during the past eight  we cannot afford to mortgage our children's future on another mountain of debt  that's why i'm not going to stand here and simply tell you what i'm going to spend  i'm going to tell you how we're going to save when i am president  i will go through the entire federal budget  page by page  line by line  and eliminate programs that don't work and aren't needed  we'll start by ending a war in iraq that's costing   billion a month while the iraqi government sits on a   billion surplus  and we'll save billions of dollars by shutting the overseas tax havens that let companies avoid paying taxes here in america  and as for those programs we do need  i'll make them work better and cost less  we'll save billions by cutting waste  improving management  and strengthening oversight  and i will finally end the abuse of no bid contracts once and for all   the days of sweetheart deals for halliburton will be over when i'm in the white house  these are the changes and reforms that we need  a new era of responsibility and accountability on wall street and in washington  common sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again  investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the  st century  bottom up growth that will create opportunity for every american  i won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever  we are all in this together  what this crisis has taught us is that at the end of the day  there is no real separation between main street and wall street  there is only the road we're traveling on as americans   and we will rise or fall on that journey as one nation  as one people  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  this is one of those moments  i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics  i understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what's been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history  i ask you to believe   to believe in yourselves  in each other  and in the future we can build together  because together  we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  or pay their bills at the end of the month  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves  we can do this  americans have done this before  some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  together  we cannot fail  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking just like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will win michigan  we will win this election  and then you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "with just a month to go until election day  i know you've all been hearing a lot about politics out here in virginia  i know you've been seeing a lot of ads  and getting a lot of calls  and reading a lot about this election in the newspaper  but being here today to talk with you about health care   this isn't about politics for me  this is personal  i'm thinking today about my mother  she died of ovarian cancer at the age of   she fought valiantly  and endured the pain and chemotherapy with grace and good humor  but i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life  at a time when she should have been focused on getting well  at a time when she should have been taking stock of her life and taking comfort in her family  she was lying in a hospital bed  fighting with her insurance company because they didn't want to cover her treatment  they claimed that her cancer was a pre existing condition  so i know something about the heartbreak caused by our health care system  i know something about the anxiety of families hanging on by a thread as premiums have doubled these past eight years  and they're going into debt  and more than half   half   of all personal bankruptcies are caused in part by medical bills  i know about the frustration of the nearly   percent of small business owners who can no longer afford to insure their employees   folks who work day and night  but have to lay people off  or shut their doors for good  because of rising health care costs  i know the outrage we all feel about the   million americans who don't have health insurance   kids who can't see a doctor when they're sick  parents cutting their pills in half and praying for the best  folks who wind up in the emergency room in the middle of the night because they've got nowhere else to turn  but i also know that this is not who we are  we are not a country where a young woman i met should have to work the night shift after a full day of college and still not be able to pay the medical bills for her sister who's ill  that's not right   and it's not who we are  we are not a country where a man i met should have to file for bankruptcy after he had a stroke  because he faced nearly   in medical costs that he couldn't afford and his insurance company didn't cover  that's not right   and it's not who we are  we are not a country that rewards hard work and perseverance with debt and worry  we've never been a country that lets major challenges go unsolved and unaddressed  and we are tired of watching as year after year  candidates offer up detailed health care plans with great fanfare and promise  only to see them crushed under the weight of washington politics and drug and insurance lobbying once the campaign is over  that is not who we are  and that is not who we have to be  we know change is possible  we've seen it across this country as governors and legislatures move ahead of washington to pass bold health care initiatives on their own  we see people across the spectrum   doctors and patients  unions and businesses  democrats and republicans   coming together around this issue  because at a time when rising costs have put too many families and businesses on a collision course with financial ruin and left too many without coverage at all  they know that bandaids and half measures just won't do  now i know that at this moment  when we stand in the midst of a serious economic crisis  some might ask how we can afford to focus on health care  well  let's be clear  the rescue package we just passed in congress isn't the end of what we need to do to fix our economy   it's just the beginning  because the fundamentals of our economy are still not strong   contrary to what senator mccain says  and we've got to address those fundamentals   and address them right now  in other words  the question isn't how we can afford to focus on health care   but how we can afford not to  because in order to fix our economic crisis  and rebuild our middle class  we need to fix our health care system too  let's not forget  it's not just small businesses and families who are struggling  some of the largest corporations in america   including major american auto manufacturers   are struggling to compete in the global marketplace because of high health care costs  they're watching their foreign competitors prosper   unburdened by these costs   as they struggle to create the good jobs we need to get our economy back on track  so it's clear that the time has come   right now   to solve this problem  to cut health care costs for families and businesses  and provide affordable  accessible health insurance for every american  and you'd think that anyone running for president would understand this  you'd think any candidate for the highest office in the land would have a plan to achieve these critically important goals  well  if you think that  you haven't met my opponent  senator john mccain  now  it's not that he doesn't care about what people are going through  i just think he doesn't know  that's the only reason i can think of that he'd propose a health care plan that is so radical  so out of touch with what you're facing  and so out of line with our basic values  senator mccain has been eager to share some details of his plan   but not all  he tells you that he'll give you a tax credit of   per person     per family   to help you pay for your insurance and health care costs  but like those ads for prescription drugs  you have to read the fine print to learn the rest of the story  you see  senator mccain would pay for his plan  in part  by taxing your health care benefits for the first time in history  and this tax would come out of your paycheck  but the new tax credit he's proposing  that wouldn't go to you  it would go directly to your insurance company   not your bank account  so when you read the fine print  it's clear that john mccain is pulling an old washington bait and switch  it's a shell game  he gives you a tax credit with one hand   but raises your taxes with the other  and recently  after some forceful questioning on tv  he finally admitted that for some americans   those with the very best plans   his tax increase will be higher than his tax credit  and they'll come out behind  john mccain calls these plans  cadillac plans  in some cases  it may be that a corporate ceo is getting too good a deal  but what if you're a line worker making a good american car like cadillac who's given up wage increases in exchange for better health care  well  senator mccain believes you should pay higher taxes too  the bottom line  the better your health care plan   the harder you've fought for good benefits   the higher the taxes you'll pay under john mccain's plan  and here's something else senator mccain won't tell you  when he taxes people's benefits  many younger  healthier workers will decide that it's a better deal to opt out of the insurance they get at work   and instead  go out into the individual market  where they can buy a cheaper plan  many employers will be left with an older  sicker pool of workers who they can't afford to cover  as a result  many employers will drop their health care plans altogether  and study after study has shown  that under the mccain plan  at least   million americans will lose the insurance they rely on from their workplace  it's the same approach george w  bush floated a few years ago  it was dead on arrival in congress  but if senator mccain were to succeed where george bush failed  it very well could be the beginning of the end of our employer based health care system  in fact  some experts have said that that's exactly the point of john mccain's plan   to drive you out of the insurance you have through your employer   and out into the marketplace  where your family will be given that   tax credit and told to buy insurance on your own  a   tax credit  that sounds pretty good  but what senator mccain doesn't tell you is that the average cost of a family health care plan these days is more than twice that much     so where would that leave you  senator mccain also doesn't tell you that insurance in the individual market isn't just more expensive than insurance you get through work   it also includes fewer benefits  for example  many of these plans don't cover prescription drugs or pre natal care  many don't cover giving birth  so you'd have to pay out of pocket for that   roughly   so when you're out there fending for yourself against the insurance companies  you pay more and get less  here's another thing senator mccain doesn't tell you   his plan won't do a thing to stop insurance companies from discriminating against you if you have a pre existing condition like hypertension  asthma  diabetes or cancer the kind of conditions that   million working age americans suffer from   people from all backgrounds and walks of life all across this country  employers don't charge you higher premiums for these conditions  but insurers do   much higher  so the sicker you've been  the more you'll have to pay  and the harder it'll be to get the care you need  finally  what john mccain doesn't tell you is that his plan calls for massive deregulation of the insurance industry that would leave families without the basic protections you rely on  you may have heard about how  in the current issue of a magazine  senator mccain wrote that we need to open up health care to   and i quote    more vigorous nationwide competition as we have done over the last decade in banking  that's right  he wants to deregulate the insurance industry just like he fought to deregulate the banking industry  and we've all seen how well that worked out  it would be equally catastrophic for your health care  right now  different states have different rules about what insurance companies have to cover  senator mccain's plan would create a deregulated national market where companies can cherry pick the state where they're based   and sell plans anywhere in america  it's the starting gun for a race to the bottom  insurance companies will rush to set up shop in states with the fewest protections for patients  states where they don't have to cover things like mammograms and other cancer screenings  vaccinations  maternity care  and mental health care  states where you don't have a right to appeal when your hmo refuses to cover the treatment you need  these are commonsense protections to make sure that you and your doctor   not insurance company bureaucrats   are making decisions about your health  and john mccain wants to give insurance companies free reign to avoid them  and believe it or not  just to top it all off  senator mccain plans to give the top ten largest insurance companies   billion in new tax cuts  so  anyone want to guess who's running and funding john mccain's campaign  i'll give you a hint  remember when we tried to fix health care back in the  s  and the insurance companies spent millions running misleading ads to scare people into opposing reform  that's right  john mccain has lobbyists for   insurance and drug companies and trade groups advising his campaign  writing his policies  and raising his money  three of them are his top advisors  and if you think that washington lobbyists who are working day and night to elect him are doing it to put themselves out of business  well  i've got a bridge in alaska to sell you  so here's john mccain's radical plan in a nutshell  he taxes health care benefits for the first time in history  millions lose the health care they have  millions pay more for the health care they get  drug and insurance companies continue to profit  and middle class families watch the system they rely on begin to unravel before their eyes  well  i don't think that's right  i don't think we should settle for health care that works better for drug and insurance companies than it does for hard working americans  i don't think that's the change we need  we can do better than that  in the end  it's not surprising that senator mccain's plan isn't a vast improvement on the same failed policies of these past eight years  remember  senator mccain voted against expanding the children's health insurance program   a program that provides health care for millions of children in need  he voted against protecting medicare   times over the course of his career  and he supported a massive cut in medicare that would have raised premiums and out of pocket expenses for seniors while weakening the care they depend on  in other words  senator mccain's plan reflects the same bankrupt philosophy he's subscribed to for the past three decades in washington  take care of the healthy and wealthy  and good luck to everyone else  they call this the ownership society  but what it really means is   you're on your own  your job doesn't give you health care  the market will fix it  pre existing condition  tough luck  insurance company won't pay for your treatment  too bad  you're on your own  this approach hasn't worked these past eight years  it won't work now  and it's time to turn the page  let me be clear   i don't think government can solve all our problems  but i reject the radical idea that government has no role to play in protecting ordinary americans  i reject the thinking that says preserving our free market means letting corporations and special interests do as they please  i know that nothing is more important than the health and well being of the people you love  and if you work hard and do everything right  you shouldn't live in fear of losing everything because of a fluke of genetics  or a bad diagnosis  or a stroke of bad luck  that's why i believe that every single american has the right to affordable  accessible health care   a right that should never be subject to washington politics or industry profiteering  and that should never be purchased with tax increases on middle class families  because that is the last thing we need in an economy like this  i know we can do this  i know what we can accomplish when we come together  i saw it in illinois  when as a state senator  i brought republicans and democrats together to pass legislation that has expanded coverage to more than   people  including   children  i helped expand coverage for routine mammograms for women on medicaid  and we created hospital report cards  so that every consumer could see things like the ratio of nurses to patients  the number of annual medical errors  and the quality of care they could expect at each hospital  so i reject the tired old debate that says we have to choose between two extremes  government run health care with higher taxes or insurance companies without rules denying people coverage  that's a false choice  it's the same distracting rhetoric that's kept us gridlocked for decades  and we know that neither of these approaches is the answer to this problem  the real solution is to take on drug and insurance companies  modernize our health care system for the twenty first century  reduce costs for families and businesses  and finally provide affordable  accessible health care for every american  and that's what i intend to do as president of the united states  of course  it's easy to have good ideas and make big promises  you've all heard plenty of that these past   months  the hard part is coming up with a concrete  detailed plan  and translating that plan into action  so today  i want to take a few minutes to tell you exactly what i plan to do  how i'll get it done  and how i'm going to pay for it  we'll start by reducing premiums by as much as   per family   and we'll do it by taking the following five steps to lower costs throughout our health care system  first  we'll take on the drug and insurance companies and hold them accountable for the prices they charge and the harm they cause  we'll start by increasing competition in the insurance industry  and outlawing insurance company discrimination against people with pre existing conditions  insurance companies spend   billion a year on elaborate efforts to cherry pick the healthiest patients and avoid covering everyone else  i intend to save them a whole lot of time and money by putting an end to this practice once and for all  and we'll tell the pharmaceutical companies  thanks  but no thanks for the overpriced drugs   drugs that cost twice as much here as they do in europe and canada  we'll let medicare negotiate for lower prices  we'll stop drug companies from blocking generic drugs that are just as effective  and far less expensive  and we'll allow the safe re importation of low cost drugs from countries like canada  second  we'll focus on prevention   on promoting wellness rather than just managing sickness  today  we spend less than four cents of every health care dollar on prevention and public health  even though   percent of risk factors involved in the leading causes of death are behavior related   and thus  preventable  under my plan  we'll make sure insurance companies cover evidence based  preventive care services   weight loss programs  smoking cessation programs  and other efforts to help people avoid costly  debilitating health problems in the first place  third  we'll reduce waste and inefficiency by moving from a  th century health care system based on pen and paper to a  st century system based on the latest technology  according to one study  just by transferring medical records from yellowing pages in file cabinets to electronic records in computers  we can save   billion a year  and we can save lives too by reducing deadly medical errors and ensuring that doctors and nurses spend less time with paperwork and more time with patients  fourth  we'll reduce the cost of our care by improving the quality of our care  it's estimated that poor quality care   from medical errors that cause complications to poor hygiene practices that cause infections   costs up to   billion a year  so we'll provide you with information about your hospitals' and providers' quality of care  we'll track which drugs and procedures work best  and we'll reward providers not just for the quantity of services they provide  but for the quality of outcomes for their patients  so you'll get better care  and we'll all save money in the long run  fifth  we'll reduce costs for businesses and their workers by picking up the tab for some of the most expensive illnesses  right now  the five percent of patients with the most serious illnesses like cancer and heart disease account for nearly fifty percent of health care costs  insurance companies devote the lion's share of their expenses to these patients  and then pass the cost on to the rest of us in the form of higher premiums  under my plan  the federal government will pay for part of these catastrophic cases  which means that your premiums will go down  so that's how we'll cut costs  but that's not enough  because today  in the year     million americans still don't have any health insurance at all  this is one of the great moral crises of our time  and it's creating a vicious cycle that affects every last one of us  as premiums rise  more people become uninsured  and every time those uninsured folks walk into an emergency room because it's their only option  insurance companies raise premiums to cover the cost   a hidden tax of   per family  that extra cost means even more people can't afford insurance  so the problem just gets worse  we cannot go on like this  this is not who we are  and this is not who we have to be  that's why my plan will cover all americans  and unlike senator mccain  i'll do it by building on and strengthening   rather than dismantling   our current  workplace based system  so if you have insurance you like  you keep that insurance  if you have a doctor you like  you keep that doctor  the only thing that changes for you is that your health care costs will go down  but if you don't have insurance  or don't like your insurance  you'll be able to choose from the same type of quality private plans as every federal employee   from a postal worker here in colorado to a congressman in washington  all of these plans will cover essential medical services including prevention  maternity  disease management and mental health care  no one will be turned away because of a pre existing condition or illness  if you have children  they will be covered too  if you change jobs  this insurance will go with you  and if you can't afford this insurance  you'll receive a tax credit to help pay for it  my plan also provides substantial help to small business to cover their employees  small businesses are america's biggest job creators  since   companies with fewer than   employees have created   of new jobs in america  but today  too many small businesses are sinking under the weight of rising health care costs  my health care plan won't impose a single new burden on small businesses  instead  we'll give them tax credits that will cover up to   percent of the cost of insuring their employees  this will help them create not just new jobs  but good jobs   jobs with health care that stay right here in america  and i want to be clear about exactly how i will pay for my plan  first  i will aggressively cut health care costs by reducing waste  greed and paperwork  lowering the cost of prescription drugs  and eliminating wasteful subsidies to private plans in medicare  that will save a lot  but will still leave a cost of about   billion a year  i'll cover that remaining cost with a portion of the money i'll save by ending george bush's tax breaks for people making more than   a year  they'll go back to paying similar rates to what they paid when bill clinton was president  so we'll get this done responsibly without blowing a hole in our deficit  in the end  none of this will be easy  we're up against a powerful  entrenched status quo in washington that will say anything and do anything and fight with everything they've got to keep things the way they are  but i know that if we come together  and work together  we can do this  so many people are counting on us  a woman named robyn who i met in florida  is one of those people  back in may  her   year old son devon came to one of our events  and i got to meet him at the airport in fort lauderdale  later that day  devon became seriously ill  his heart started racing  and his lips turned white  he was rushed to the hospital and almost went into cardiac arrest  he was later diagnosed with a heart condition and told he needed a procedure that would cost tens of thousands of dollars  robyn's insurance company refused to pay   they said it was a pre existing condition   and robyn's family doesn't have that kind of money  but until devon has that procedure  he has to take medication and stop all physical activity  no more gym classes  no more football at school  no more basketball at the park with his friends  after we met  robyn sent me an email in which she wrote   my son deserves all that life has to offer  money should never determine the quality of a child's life  i can't help but feel as if somehow we failed devon  why couldn't we be the rich family that has the great insurance or could whip out   grand like it is nothing  she ended her email with these words   i ask only this of you   on the days where you feel so tired you can't think of uttering another word to the people  think of us  on the days when you are playing basketball  think of devon  who can't  when those who oppose you have you down  reach deep and fight back harder  today  i want to say to robyn and devon and everyone like them across america  you have my word that i will never back down  i will never give up  i will never stop fighting until we have fixed our health care system and no family ever has to go through what you're going through  and my mother went through  and so many people go through every day in this country  that is my promise to you  and if all of you here today will stand with me in this work   if you'll talk to your friends and neighbors  get people to the polls  and give me your vote  then together  we won't just win this election  we will transform this nation  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "with just a month to go until election day  i know you've all been hearing a lot about politics out here in north carolina  i know you've been seeing a lot of ads  and getting a lot of calls  and reading a lot about this election in the newspaper  but none of you need the papers  or ads on tv  or folks like me to tell you what this election is all about  you know what's at stake  you're living it  here in asheville  and across america  you've seen your incomes go down as the price of just about everything has gone way up  it's harder to pay the bills  harder to send your kids to college  harder to save enough to retire  and on friday  we learned that we'd lost another   american jobs in september  it was the ninth straight month of job losses   more than three quarters of a million this year  including   here in north carolina  and it came just as we finished a week in which our financial markets teetered on the brink of disaster  yet instead of addressing these crises  senator mccain's campaign has announced that they plan to turn the page on the discussion about our economy and spend the final weeks of this campaign launching swiftboat style attacks on me  think about that for a second  turn the page on the economy  we're facing the worst economic crisis since the great depression  and john mccain wants us to  turn the page  well  i know the policies he's supported these past eight years and wants to continue are pretty hard to defend  i can understand why senator mccain would want to  turn the page  and ignore this economy  but i also know this  you're trying to pay your bills every week and stay above the water   you can't ignore it  you're worrying about whether your job will be there a month from now   you can't ignore it  you're worrying about whether you can pay your mortgage and stay in your house   you can't turn the page  in   days you are going to elect the next president  and you need and deserve

another president who ignores our problems  not more of the same  senator mccain and his operatives are gambling that he can distract you with smears rather than talk to you about substance  they'd rather try to tear our campaign down than lift this country up  it's what you do when you're out of touch  out of ideas  and running out of time  i want you to know that i'm going to keep on talking about the issues that matter   about the economy and health care and education and energy  i'm going to keep on standing up for hard working families  we're not going to let john mccain distract us from what we need to do to move this country forward  because november  th  you and i are going to turn the page on the disastrous economic policies of george w  bush and john mccain  and one of the issues we must face and can't ignore is the explosion of health care costs that is crushing families and businesses across our country  understand  this is very personal to me  i'm thinking today about my mother  she died of ovarian cancer at the age of   she fought valiantly  and endured the pain and chemotherapy with grace and good humor  but i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life  at a time when she should have been focused on getting well  at a time when she should have been taking stock of her life and taking comfort in her family  she was lying in a hospital bed  fighting with her insurance company because they didn't want to cover her treatment  they claimed that her cancer was a pre existing condition  so i know something about the heartbreak caused by our health care system  i know something about the anxiety of families hanging on by a thread as premiums have doubled  and debt piles up  and more than half   half   of all personal bankruptcies are caused in part by medical bills  i know about the frustration of the nearly   percent of small business owners who can no longer afford to insure their employees   folks who work day and night  but have to lay people off  or shut their doors for good  because of rising health care costs  i know the outrage we all feel about the   million americans who don't have health insurance   kids who can't see a doctor when they're sick  parents cutting their pills in half and praying for the best  folks who wind up in the emergency room in the middle of the night because they've got nowhere else to turn  but i also know that this is not who we are  we are not a country where a young woman i met should have to work the night shift after a full day of college and still not be able to pay the medical bills for her sister who's ill  that's not right   and it's not who we are  we are not a country where a man i met should have to file for bankruptcy after he had a stroke  because he faced nearly   in medical costs that he couldn't afford and his insurance company didn't cover  that's not right   and it's not who we are  that is not who we are  and that is not who we have to be  enough is enough   it's time for change  now i know that at this moment  when we stand in the midst of a serious economic crisis  some might ask how we can afford to focus on health care  major financial institutions have collapsed  families across america are struggling  and it's clear that the rescue package we just passed in congress isn't the end of what we need to do to fix our economy   it's just the beginning  because contrary to what senator mccain says  the fundamentals of our economy are still not strong  and we've got to address those fundamentals right now  in other words  the question isn't how we can afford to focus on health care   but how we can afford not to  because in order to fix our economic crisis  we need to fix our health care system too  let's not forget  it's

i quote    more vigorous nationwide competition as we have done over the last decade in banking  that's right  he wants to deregulate the insurance industry just like he fought to deregulate the banking industry  and we've all seen how well that worked out  it would be equally catastrophic for your health care  right now  different states have different rules about what insurance companies have to cover  senator mccain will let companies avoid these rules  he'll let them cherry pick the state where they're based   and sell plans anywhere in america  it's the starting gun for a race to the bottom  insurance companies will rush to set up shop in states with the fewest protections for patients   states where they don't have to cover things like mammograms  vaccinations and maternity care  now what does this mean for folks here in north carolina  well  this state requires insurance companies to cover mental health care  cancer screening  contraception  treatment for alcoholism and more  and here in north carolina  you have the right to appeal when your hmo refuses to cover the treatment you need  under john mccain's plan  insurance companies wouldn't have to follow any of these rules  these are commonsense protections to make sure that you and your doctor   not insurance company bureaucrats   are making decisions about your health  and john mccain wants to let insurance companies go around them  so while senator mccain talks a lot about preserving states' rights   when it comes down to it  his plan is all about protecting insurance companies' rights  well  i think it's time we started putting the health of our families before the profits of our insurance companies   and that's what i'm going to do as president  i also want to talk a little about how exactly senator mccain would pay for his plan  he's been eager to share some details about that   but not all  he tells you that he'll give you a tax credit of   per person     per family   to help you pay for your insurance and health care costs  but like those ads for prescription drugs  you have to read the fine print to learn the rest of the story  you see  senator mccain would pay for his plan  in part  by taxing your health care benefits for the first time in history  and this tax would come out of your paycheck  but the new tax credit he's proposing  that wouldn't go to you  it would go directly to your insurance company  it's an old washington bait and switch  it's a shell game  senator mccain gives you a tax credit with one hand   but raises your taxes with the other  he's hoping we won't notice  well  i've got news for john mccain  we notice  we know better  and we're not going to let him get away with that  because here's what happens when senator mccain taxes your benefits  a lot of younger  healthier workers will opt out of the insurance they get at work   and go out into the individual market  where they can buy a cheaper plan  that leaves employers with older  sicker workers who are more expensive to cover   so many employers will drop their health care plans altogether  it's the same approach president bush floated a few years ago  and it could be the beginning of the end of our employer based health care system  in fact  studies show that under the mccain plan  at least   million americans will lose the insurance you rely on from your workplace  your families will have to go out into the marketplace with that   tax credit and buy insurance on your own  but what senator mccain doesn't tell you is that the average cost of a family health care plan is more than twice that much     so where would that leave you  senator mccain also doesn't tell you that insurance in the individual market is more expensive and includes fewer benefits  many of these plans don't cover things like prescription drugs or pre natal care  and senator mccain's health care plan won't do a thing to stop insurance companies from discriminating against you if you have a pre existing condition like hypertension  asthma  diabetes or cancer  employers don't charge you higher premiums for these conditions  but insurers do   much higher  so the sicker you've been  the harder it'll be to get the care you need  so here's john mccain's radical plan in a nutshell  he taxes health care benefits for the first time in history  millions lose the health care they have  millions pay more for the health care they get  drug and insurance companies continue to profit  and middle class families watch the system they rely on begin to unravel before their eyes  well  i don't think that's the change we need  i think we can do better than that  in the end  my opponent's plan reflects the same bankrupt philosophy he's subscribed to for three decades in washington  take care of the healthy and wealthy  and good luck to everyone else  they call this the ownership society  but what it really means is   you're on your own  your job doesn't give you health care  the market will fix it  pre existing condition  tough luck  insurance company won't pay for your treatment  too bad  you're on your own  this approach hasn't worked these past eight years  it won't work now  and it's time for change  let me be clear   i don't think government can solve all our problems  but i reject the radical idea that government has no role to play in protecting ordinary americans  i reject the thinking that says preserving our free market means letting corporations and special interests do as they please  and everyone else has to fend for themselves  i believe that if you work hard and do everything right  you shouldn't live in fear of losing everything because of a fluke of genetics  or a bad diagnosis  or a stroke of bad luck  that is why  if i'm elected president  we're going to fix our health care system  we're going to take on the drug and insurance companies  reduce costs for families and businesses  and finally provide affordable  accessible health care for every american  we'll start by lowering premiums by as much as   per family   and we'll do it by taking the following five steps to lower costs throughout our health care system  first  we'll take on the drug companies  tell them thanks but no thanks for the overpriced drugs  and take steps to lower prices so people can afford them  and we'll tell the insurance companies  no more discrimination against people with pre existing conditions  it's not right  and we won't stand for it  second  we'll focus on prevention  we'll make sure insurance companies cover services like weight loss programs and smoking cessation programs to help people avoid costly  debilitating health problems in the first place  third  we'll reduce waste and inefficiency by using the latest technologies to move our health care system into the  st century  this will save tens of billions a year  reduce medical errors  and let doctors and nurses spend less time with paperwork and more time with patients  fourth  we'll reduce the cost of our care by improving the quality of our care  we'll track which drugs and procedures work best and reward providers not just for the quantity of care they provide   but for the quality of outcomes for their patients  fifth  we'll help businesses and workers by picking up the tab for some of the most expensive illnesses  under my plan  the federal government will pay for part of these catastrophic cases  which means lower premiums for you   and less money out of your pocket  but cost cutting isn't enough  because today  in the year     million americans still don't have any health insurance at all  this is one of the great moral crises of our time  it's not who we are   and it's not who we have to be  that's why my plan will cover all americans  and unlike senator mccain  i'll do it by building on   rather than dismantling   our current  workplace based system  so if you have insurance you like  you keep that insurance  if you have a doctor you like  you keep that doctor  the only thing that changes for you is that your health care costs will go down  but if you don't have insurance  or don't like your insurance  you'll be able to choose from the same type of quality private plans as every federal employee   from a postal worker here in north carolina to a congressman in washington  no one will be turned away because of a pre existing condition  if you change jobs  this insurance will go with you  and if you can't afford this insurance  you'll receive a tax credit to help pay for it  we'll also provide substantial help for small businesses in the form of tax credits that will cover up to   percent of the cost of insuring their employees  this will help them create not just new jobs  but good jobs   jobs with health care that stay right here in america  and here's how i'll pay for my plan  first  i will aggressively cut health care costs by reducing waste  greed and paperwork  lowering the cost of prescription drugs  and eliminating wasteful subsidies to private plans in medicare  that will save a lot  but will still leave a cost of about   billion a year  i'll cover that remaining cost with a portion of the money i'll save by ending george bush's tax breaks for people making more than   a year  they'll go back to paying the kind of rates they paid when bill clinton was president  so we'll get this done responsibly without blowing a hole in our deficit  in the end  none of this will be easy  we're up against a powerful  entrenched status quo in washington that will say anything and do anything and fight with everything they've got to keep things the way they are  but i know that if we come together  and work together  we can do this  so many people are counting on us  a woman named robyn who i met in florida  is one of those people  back in may  her   year old son devon  deh vinn  came to one of our events  and i got to meet him at the airport in fort lauderdale  later that day  devon became seriously ill  his heart started racing  and his lips turned white  he was rushed to the hospital and almost went into cardiac arrest  he was later diagnosed with a heart condition and told he needed a procedure that would cost tens of thousands of dollars  robyn's insurance company refused to pay   they said it was a pre existing condition   and robyn's family doesn't have that kind of money  but until devon has that procedure  he has to take medication and stop all physical activity  no more gym classes  no more football at school  no more basketball at the park with his friends  after we met  robyn sent me an email in which she wrote   i can't help but feel as if somehow we failed devon  why couldn't we be the rich family that has the great insurance or could whip out   grand like it is nothing  she ended her email with these words   i ask only this of you   on the days where you feel so tired you can't think of uttering another word to the people  think of us  on the days when you are playing basketball  think of devon  who can't  when those who oppose you have you down  reach deep and fight back harder  today  i want to say to robyn and devon and everyone like them across america  you have my word that i will never back down  i will never give up  i will never stop fighting until we have fixed our health care system and no family ever has to go through what you're going through  and my mother went through  and so many people go through every day in this country  that is my promise to you  and if all of you here today will stand with me in this work   if you'll talk to your friends and neighbors  get people to the polls  and give me your vote  then together  we won't just win this election  we will transform this nation  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "we meet today at a moment of great uncertainty for america  yesterday  we saw another significant drop in the stock market as the anxiety about this financial crisis grew worse  overnight  the same thing happened with markets around the world  and this morning  the federal reserve took swift action together with other nations to stem what is now a full blown global financial crisis  i support that action  as i've said before that this is a global problem and it needs to be solved through a global effort  i hope this global response continues as leaders of major financial institutions and representatives from nations around the world gather in washington soon  we are facing a very serious challenge  and all of us   all of us   have a stake in its solution  because the credit markets are frozen right now  there's a ripple effect throughout our economy  businesses large and small are finding it impossible to get loans  which means they can't buy new equipment or make payroll  auto plants that have been around for decades are closing their doors and laying off workers who've never known another job in their entire life  and we have already lost three quarters of a million jobs just this year  here in indianapolis and all across america  you're seeing your hours get cut or realizing that you can't pay every bill that's sitting on the kitchen counter  it's harder to make the mortgage or fill up your gas tank and some people don't even know whether they'll be able to keep the electricity on at the end of the month  the money you've been putting away for your retirement or your kids' college education is disappearing faster than you can count  the dream that so many generations have fought for feels like it's slowly slipping away  but i'm here today to tell you that there are better days ahead  i know these are tough times  i know that many of you are anxious about the future  but this isn't a time for fear or panic  this is a time for resolve and leadership  i know that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  because that's who we are  because this is the united states of america  this is a nation that has faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we have risen to meet these challenges   not as democrats  not as republicans  but as americans  with resolve  with confidence  with that fundamental belief that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  that's who we are  and that's the country we need to be right now  america still has the most talented  most productive workers of any country on earth who work two jobs or three jobs and take the last bus home at night because they want something more for their children  we're still the home to innovation and technology  colleges and universities that are the envy of the world  some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities  it won't be easy  but there's no reason we can't steer ourselves out of this crisis and make this century another american century  of course we can  but i also know this  it will take a new direction  it will take new leadership in washington  it will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years  and that's why the decision you make in twenty seven days is so important  that's why this is no ordinary election   because this is no ordinary moment for america  in last night's debate  john mccain and i each had the chance to make the case for change   to talk about what we would do differently from the last eight years when it comes to lifting our middle class  growing our economy  and restoring our prosperity  but all we heard from senator mccain was more of the same bush economics that led us to this point  take health care  we were both asked whether we believed that health care should finally be the right of every american  i believe it should  but senator mccain didn't say that  and when you look at his radical health care plan  you can see why  he talks about giving every family a   credit to buy health care  but he didn't mention last night that he'll also tax your benefits for the first time in history  it's an old washington bait and switch  he gives you a tax credit with one hand  but raises your taxes with the other  and he didn't mention that the average health care plan costs   in the first place  senator mccain didn't tell us about the studies that say his plan would cause   million americans to lose their health insurance  or how the chamber of commerce said it would be a disaster for businesses  or how it would de regulate the insurance industry so that they don't have to cover things like mammograms  or vaccinations  or maternity care  he thinks we won't notice these things  well  i've got news for john mccain  we notice  we know better  and we're not going to let him get away with it  this issue is personal for me  my mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of   and i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed  fighting with her insurance company because they claimed that her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  if i am president  i will make sure those insurance companies can never do that again  my health care plan will ensure that insurance companies can't discriminate against those who are sick and need care most  if you have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is the amount you pay in premiums  that will be less  and if you don't have health insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families  businesses  and the entire economy  that's the change we need  and that's the choice you face in this election  even as so many americans are worried about their medical bills or keeping their jobs or staying in their homes  senator mccain's campaign announced last week that they plan to  turn the page  on the discussion about our economy and spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead  his campaign actually said  and i quote   if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  well i've got news for john mccain  this isn't about losing a campaign   this is about americans who are losing their jobs  and their homes  and their life savings  i can take four more weeks of john mccain's attacks  but america can't take four more years of john mccain's george bush policies  we can't afford four more years of the economic theory that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  we can't afford more four years of john mccain's call for less regulation so that no one in washington is watching anyone on wall street  we've seen where that's led us and we're not going back  it is time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put wall street before main street but ended up hurting both  we need policies that grow our economy from the bottom up  so that every american  everywhere has the chance to get ahead  not just corporate ceos  but their secretaries too  not just the person who owns the factory  but the men and women who work on its floor  because if we've learned anything from this economic crisis  it's that we're all connected  we're all in this together  and we will rise or fall as one nation   as one people  the rescue plan that passed congress last week isn't the end of what we'll do to strengthen this economy  it's only the beginning  now we need to pass a rescue plan for the middle class that will provide every family immediate relief to cope with rising food and gas prices  save one million jobs by rebuilding our schools and roads  and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax increases  and we should extend expiring unemployment benefits to those americans who've lost their jobs and can't find new ones  i've been fighting for this plan for months  my opponent has said nothing  and that is the choice in this election  you've heard a lot about taxes in this campaign  well here's the truth   john mccain and i are both offering tax cuts  the difference is  he wants to give the average fortune   ceo a   tax cut but nothing at all to over   million americans  i'll give a middle class tax cut to   of all workers  and if you make less than   a year  you won't see your taxes increase one single dime   not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  my opponent wants to give   million in tax cuts to the biggest corporations in america  i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage  high tech jobs of tomorrow  john mccain wants to give tax breaks to the corporations that ship our jobs overseas  if i am president  i will end those tax breaks and give them to companies that create good jobs in the united states of america  that is the choice in this election  senator mccain's first reaction to this economic crisis was to say that  the fundamentals of our economy are strong  well i don't know about you  but where i come from there's nothing more fundamental than a job   not just because it provides a paycheck  because it provides a sense of dignity  and if we want to turn this economy around and lead the world in the  st century  we have to create the high wage jobs of tomorrow right here in america  if i am president  i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new  green jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel efficient cars  jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from middle east dictators  i'll also put two million more americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads  schools  and bridges   because it is time to build an american infrastructure for the  st century  and we'll give every child  everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker  anywhere in the world  i will not allow countries to out teach us today so they can out compete us tomorrow  it is time to provide every american with a world class education  that means investing in early childhood education  that means recruiting an army of new teachers  and paying them better  and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability  and it means making a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  if you commit to serving your country after you graduate  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together we will move this country forward  finally  i will take on the corruption in washington and on wall street to make sure a crisis like this can never  ever happen again  i'll put in place the common sense regulations and rules of the road i've been calling for since march   rules that will keep our market free  fair  and honest  rules that will restore accountability and responsibility in our corporate boardrooms  and just as we demand accountability on wall street  i will also demand it in washington  that's why i'm not going to stand here and simply tell you what i'm going to spend  i'm going to tell you how we're going to save when i am president  i'll do what you do in your own family budgets and make sure we're spending money wisely  i will go through the entire federal budget  page by page  line by line  and eliminate programs that don't work and aren't needed  we'll start by ending a war in iraq that's costing   billion a month while the iraqi government sits on a   billion surplus  and we'll save billions more by cutting waste  improving management  and strengthening oversight  these are the changes and reforms we need  a new era of responsibility and accountability on wall street and in washington  common sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again  investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the  st century  bottom up growth that gives every american a fair shot at the american dream  i won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever  we are all in this together  what this crisis has taught us is that at the end of the day  there is no real separation between main street and wall street  there is only the road we're traveling on as americans   and we will rise or fall on that journey as one nation  as one people  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  this is one of those moments  i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics  i understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what's been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history  i ask you to believe   to believe in yourselves  in each other  and in the future we can build together  together  we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  or pay their bills at the end of the month  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves we can do this  americans have done this before  some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  together  we cannot fail  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will win indiana  we will win this election  and then you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "we meet today at a moment of great uncertainty for america  in recent weeks  we've seen a growing financial crisis that's threatening not only banks and businesses  but your economic security  as well  it's getting harder and harder to get a loan for that new car or that startup business or that college you've dreamed of attending  and if you've invested your life savings in the stock market  you've probably watched a good chunk of it disappear  it's a crisis that's been years in the making   the result of greed and irresponsibility that stretched from wall street to washington  and the truth is  it will take more than a few days to repair the damage  yesterday  the fed took another unprecedented step to cut rates together with nations around the world  and those nations will soon be gathering in washington to deal with this crisis  the next president will have to manage this recovery  the question is  will that president be looking out for you  senator mccain and i had a chance to talk about this the other night in nashville  some of you may have seen it  in that debate  he offered what he said was a new idea to help deal with the financial crisis  and that was to have the government   meaning taxpayers   buy up bad mortgages in america  well  the idea wasn't particularly new  the authority for the secretary of treasury to buy and renegotiate bad mortgages is part of the financial rescue plan we just passed  in fact  i proposed it myself because  if it's properly done and limited in scope  such buybacks can be one tool to help innocent homeowners stay in their homes on terms they can afford  but i also said at the time that this should not be a vehicle to reward banks and lending institutions that recklessly wrote bad loans  it should not be a bailout for the high rolling real estate speculators who took those loans to make a quick buck  we have to act to fix our broken economy and restore the credit markets  but taxpayers shouldn't be asked to pick up the tab for the very folks who helped create this crisis  and that's the problem with senator mccain's risky idea  on tuesday night  his campaign said that he would ask the banks to absorb some of the cost by selling the bad mortgages to the government at a discount  then  by wednesday morning  he'd changed his mind and was proposing to bail out banks and lenders with taxpayer money  senator mccain actually wants the government to pay the full face value of mortgages on the books  even though they're not worth that much anymore  it's a plan that would guarantee that american taxpayers lose by handing over   billion to underwrite the kind of greed and irresponsibility on wall street that got us into this mess  but it's not just that the mccain bailout rewards irresponsible lenders  it's that his bailout would make it more likely that those lenders keep up their bad behavior  just yesterday  countrywide  one of the nation's largest lenders  reached an agreement to help homeowners refinance their mortgages  under senator mccain's plan  lenders like countrywide wouldn't have any incentive to come forward and help homeowners   because they could just wait for the government to bail them out  now  this is just the latest in a series of shifting positions that senator mccain has taken on this issue  his first response to this crisis in march was that homeowners shouldn't get any help at all  then  a few weeks ago  he put out a plan that basically ignored homeowners  and now  in the course of   hours  he's ended up with a plan that punishes taxpayers  rewards banks  and won't solve our housing crisis  well  i don't think we can afford that kind of erratic and uncertain leadership in these uncertain times  we need steady leadership in the white house  we need a president we can trust in times of crisis  and that's the kind of president i intend to be  make no mistake  we must do more to help innocent homebuyers  i've worked on a series of proposals over the past two years to do that  and i support the treasury's efforts to buy up troubled mortgages  but we need to do it in a responsible way  that means making sure that we're not overpaying for these mortgages and rewarding the very lenders whose recklessness helped cause this crisis  it means giving taxpayers a share of the benefit when our housing market recovers  and it means doing what i proposed more than two years ago and cracking down on predatory lenders by treating mortgage fraud like the crime that it is  we also have to make sure that if the treasury moves forward with its plan to put more money into struggling banks  taxpayers will be able to get their money back and the ceos who contributed to this crisis won't get rich as a result  and those aig executives who went on vacation with taxpayer dollars  they should return to washington with a check for the taxpayers and be fired on the spot  now  there are other steps we can take to help homeowners that won't cost taxpayers a dime  one thing we can do is change our bankruptcy laws so they help ordinary folks  right now  the law lets bankruptcy judges write down your mortgage if you own six or seven homes  but not if you have only one  that might help senator mccain sleep easier at night  but it won't do anything for people like you  that's why if i'm president  and you're like most people and own only one home  i'll make sure those judges can write down your mortgage too  so i know these are difficult times   for ohio and for america  but i believe we can steer ourselves out of this crisis   not just because i have confidence in the plan i'm proposing or the leadership i'm offering  but because i believe in you  because i believe in this country  because this is the united states of america  this is a nation that has faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we have risen to meet these challenges   not as democrats  not as republicans  but as americans  with resolve  with courage  with that fundamental belief that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  that's who we are  and that's the country we need to be right now  america still has the most talented  most productive workers of any country on earth who work two jobs or three jobs and take the last bus home at night because they want something more for their children  we're still the home to innovation and technology  colleges and universities that are the envy of the world  some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities  it won't be easy  but there's no reason we can't make this century another american century  of course we can  but i also know this  it will take a new direction  it will take new leadership in washington  it will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years  and that's why the decision you make in twenty six days is so important  that's why this is no ordinary election   because this is no ordinary moment for america  and yet  even as we face the most serious economic crisis of our time  even as so many americans are worried about keeping their jobs or paying their bills or staying in their homes  senator mccain's

economic theory that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  we can't afford more four years of john mccain's call for less regulation so that no one in washington is watching anyone on wall street  we've seen where that's led us and we're not going back  it is time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put wall street before main street but ended up hurting both  we need policies that grow our economy from the bottom up  so that every american  everywhere has the chance to get ahead  not just corporate ceos  but their secretaries too  not just the person who owns the factory  but the men and women who work on its floor  because if we've learned anything from this economic crisis  it's that we're all connected  we're all in this together  and we will rise or fall as one nation   as one people  the rescue plan that passed congress last week isn't the end of what we'll do to strengthen this economy  it's only the beginning  now we need to pass a rescue plan for the middle class that will provide every family immediate relief to cope with rising food and gas prices  save one million jobs by rebuilding our schools and roads  and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax increases  and we should extend expiring unemployment benefits to those americans who've lost their jobs and can't find new ones  i've been fighting for this plan for months  my opponent has said nothing  and that is the choice in this election  you've heard a lot about taxes in this campaign  well  here's the truth   john mccain and i are both offering tax cuts  the difference is  he wants to give the average fortune   ceo a   tax cut but nothing at all to over   million americans  i'll give a middle class tax cut to   of all workers  and if you make less than   a year  you won't see your taxes increase one single dime   not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  my opponent wants to give   million in tax cuts to the biggest corporations in america  i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage  high tech jobs of tomorrow  john mccain wants to give tax breaks to the corporations that ship our jobs overseas  if i am president  i will end those tax breaks and give them to companies that create good jobs in the united states of america  that is the choice in this election  senator mccain's first reaction to this economic crisis was to say that  the fundamentals of our economy are strong  well  i don't know about you  but where i come from  there's nothing more fundamental than a job   not just because it's a source of income  but because it's a source of self respect  and if we want to turn this economy around and lead the world in the  st century  we have to create the high wage jobs of tomorrow right here in america  if i am president  i will finally fix our broken health care system  my opponent talks about giving every family a tax credit to buy health care  but what he doesn't mention is that he'll also tax your benefits for the first time in history  it's an old washington bait and switch  he gives you a tax credit with one hand  but raises your taxes with the other  he thinks we won't notice  well  i've got news for john mccain  we notice  we know better  and we're not going to let him get away with it  this issue is personal for me  my mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of   and i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed  fighting with her insurance company because they claimed that her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  if i am president  i will make sure those insurance companies can never do that again  my health care plan will make sure insurance companies can't discriminate against those who are sick and need care most  if you have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is the amount you pay in premiums  that will be less  and if you don't have health insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families  businesses  and the entire economy  that's the change we need  and that's the choice in this election  if i am president  i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new  green jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel efficient cars  jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from middle east dictators  i'll also put two million more americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads  schools  and bridges   because it is time to build an american infrastructure for the  st century  and we'll give every child  everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker  anywhere in the world  i will not allow countries to out teach us today so they can out compete us tomorrow  it is time to provide every american with a world class education  that means investing in early childhood education  that means recruiting an army of new teachers  and paying them better  and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability  and it means making a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  if you commit to serving your country after you graduate  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together  we will move this country forward  finally  i will take on the corruption in washington and on wall street to make sure a crisis like this can never  ever happen again  i'll put in place the common sense regulations and rules of the road i've been calling for since march   rules that will keep our market free  fair  and honest  rules that will restore accountability and responsibility in our corporate boardrooms  and just as we demand accountability on wall street  i will also demand it in washington  that's why i'm not going to stand here and simply tell you what i'm going to spend  i'm going to tell you how we're going to save when i am president  i'll do what you do in your own family budgets and make sure we're spending money wisely  i will go through the entire federal budget  page by page  line by line  and eliminate programs that don't work and aren't needed  we'll start by ending a war in iraq that's costing   billion a month while the iraqi government sits on a billion dollar surplus  and we'll save billions more by cutting waste  improving management  and strengthening oversight  these are the changes and reforms we need  a new era of responsibility and accountability on wall street and in washington  common sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again  investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the  st century  bottom up growth that gives every american a fair shot at the american dream  i won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever  we are all in this together  what this crisis has taught us is that at the end of the day  there is no real separation between main street and wall street  there is only the road we're traveling on as americans   and we will rise or fall on that journey as one nation  as one people  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  this is one of those moments  i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics  i understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what's been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history  i ask you to believe   to believe in yourselves  in each other  and in the future we can build together  together  we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  or pay their bills at the end of the month  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves we can do this  americans have done this before  some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  together  we cannot fail  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will win ohio  we will win this election  and then you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "we meet at a moment of great uncertainty for america  in recent weeks  we've seen a growing financial crisis that's threatening not only banks and businesses  but your economic security  as well  it's getting harder and harder to get a loan for that new car or that startup business or that college you've dreamed of attending  and yesterday  millions of americans lost more of their investments and hard earned retirement savings as the stock market took another significant plunge  we need action now  the treasury department must move as quickly as possible to implement the rescue plan that passed congress so we can ease this credit crisis that's preventing businesses and consumers from getting loans  and we also must recognize that this is not just an american problem  in this global economy  financial markets have no boundaries  so the current crisis demands a global response  this weekend  finance ministers from the world's major economies will meet in washington  they must take coordinated steps to restore confidence and to maintain our financial markets and institutions  there are many causes of this crisis  and it's very important that we respond using all the tools that we have  it's encouraging that treasury is considering dramatic steps to provide more capital to our financial institutions so they have money to lend  this is not a time for ideology   it's a time for common sense and a politics of pragmatism  the test of an idea must not be whether it is liberal or conservative   the test should be whether it works for the american people  that's what we should all be focused on in the days and weeks ahead  i know these are difficult times  i know folks are worried  but i believe that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis because i believe in this country  because this is the united states of america  this is a nation that has faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we have risen to meet these challenges   not as democrats  not as republicans  but as americans  with resolve  with courage we have seen our share of hard times  the american story has never been about things coming easy   it's been about rising to the moment when the moment is hard  about rejecting panicked division for purposeful unity  about seeing a mountaintop from the deepest valley  that's why we remember that some of the most famous words ever spoken by an american came from a president who took office in a time of turmoil    the only thing we have to fear is fear itself  now is not the time for fear  now is not the time for panic  now is the time for resolve and steady leadership  we can meet this moment  we can come together to restore confidence in the american economy  we can renew that fundamental belief   that in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  that's who we are  and that's the country we need to be right now  america still has the most talented  most productive workers of any country on earth  you know this  ohio  we're home to the workers who have built the largest middle class in history  we're home to workers who work two jobs or three jobs and take the last bus home at night because they want something more for their children  we're home to innovation and technology  colleges and universities that are the envy of the world  some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities  it won't be easy  but there's no reason we can't make this century another american century  yes we can  but i also know this  it will take a new direction  it will take new leadership in washington  it will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  even as we face the most serious economic crisis of our time  even as you are worried about keeping your jobs or paying your bills or staying in your homes  my opponent's campaign announced last week that they plan to  turn the page  on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead  senator mccain's campaign actually said  and i quote   if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  so in the last couple of days  we've seen a barrage of nasty insinuations and attacks  and i'm sure we'll see much more over the next   days  we know what's coming  we know what they're going to do  but here's the thing  ohio  they can try to  turn the page  on the economy and deny the record of the last eight years  they can run misleading ads and pursue the politics of anything goes  but it's not going to work  not this time  i think that folks are looking for something different  it's easy to rile up a crowd by stoking anger and division  but that's not what we need right now in the united states  the times are too serious  the challenges are too great  the american people aren't looking for someone who can divide this country   they're looking for someone who will lead it  we're in a serious crisis   now  more than ever  it is time to put country ahead of politics  now  more than ever  it is time to bring change to washington so that it works for the people of this country that we love  i know my opponent is worried about his campaign  but that's not what i'm concerned about  i'm thinking about the americans losing their jobs  and their homes  and their life savings  we can't afford four more years of the economic theory that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  we can't afford four more years of less regulation so that no one in washington is watching anyone on wall street  we've seen where that's led us and we're not going back  it is time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put wall street before main street but ended up hurting both  we need policies that grow our economy from the bottom up  so that every american  everywhere has the chance to get ahead  not just corporate ceos  but their secretaries too  not just the person who owns the factory  but the men and women who work on its floor  because if we've learned anything from this economic crisis  it's that we're all connected  we're all in this together  and we will rise or fall as one nation   as one people  my opponent has a fundamentally different view  recently  he proposed a plan that would hand over   billion to underwrite the kind of greed and irresponsibility on wall street that got us into this mess  it punishes taxpayers  rewards banks  and won't solve our housing crisis  at first  he said this spending would come from the rescue package that already passed  but the rescue package included taxpayer protections that prevent exactly this kind of scheme  we are not going to solve the immediate crisis by going back and changing the law we passed last week to push forward a plan that would take months to implement  so i have a different view from senator mccain  yes  we need to help innocent homebuyers  that's why i insisted that the rescue package give the treasury authority to buy and rework mortgages  we have given treasury a broad menu of options that should be pursued  but we should not put taxpayer money at unnecessary risk  taxpayers should not have all the downside without any of the upside  that's a principle that i've fought for  that's a principle that i'll maintain  and that's a principle that i'll stand up for as president  that's the choice in this election  i repeat  we must do more to help innocent homebuyers  i've worked on a series of proposals over the past two years to do that  but we need to do it in a responsible way  that means making sure that we're not overpaying for these mortgages and rewarding the very lenders whose recklessness helped cause this crisis  it means giving taxpayers a share of the benefit when our housing market recovers  and it means cracking down on predatory lenders by treating mortgage fraud like the crime that it is  we also have to make sure that if the treasury moves forward with its plan to put more money into struggling banks  taxpayers will be able to get their money back and the ceos who contributed to this crisis won't get rich at our expense  now let's be clear ohio  the rescue plan that passed congress last week isn't the end of what we need to do to strengthen this economy  it's only the beginning  now we need to pass a rescue plan for the middle class that will provide every family immediate relief to cope with rising food and gas prices  save one million jobs by rebuilding our schools and roads  and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax increases  and we should extend expiring unemployment benefits to those americans who've lost their jobs and can't find new ones  i've been fighting for this plan for months  my opponent has said nothing  and that is the choice in this election  if we're going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up  it has to start with our small businesses on main street   not just the big banks on wall street  small businesses employ half of the workers in the private sector in this country  and account for the majority of the job growth  but we also know that a credit crunch has dried up capital and put these jobs at risk   shops can't finance their inventories  and small firms can't make payroll  it's harder to get an idea off the ground  or to provide health care for your employees  if we don't act  we'll be looking at scaled back operations  shuttered shops  and laid off workers  that's why we need a small business rescue plan   so that we're extending our hand to the shops and restaurants  the start ups and small firms that create jobs and make our economy grow  main street needs relief and you need it now  we won't grow government  we'll work within the small business administration to keep folks afloat  while providing tax cuts to lift the tide  it's what we did after   and we were able to get low cost loans out to tens of thousands of small businesses  that's one of the many steps we can and should take to help stop job losses and turn this economy around  it starts with a nation wide program to provide affordable  fixed rate loans to small businesses across the country  we can run this through the sba's disaster loan program  which provides loans to small business owners get the help they need to maintain their inventory and meet their payroll  we'll also make it easier for private lenders to make small business loans by expanding the sba's loan guarantee program  by temporarily eliminating fees for borrowers and lenders  we can unlock the credit that small firms need to move forward  pay their workers  and grow their business  just as we make lending more available  we need to relieve the tax burden on small businesses to help create jobs  that's why i've proposed eliminating all capital gains taxes on investments in small businesses and start ups  and today  i'm proposing an additional temporary business tax incentive through next year to encourage new investments  because it's time to protect the jobs we have and to create the jobs of tomorrow by unlocking the drive  and ingenuity  and innovation of the american people  that's what i'll do as president of the united states bottom up growth also depends on a tax code that doesn't just work for the folks at the top  you've heard a lot about taxes in this campaign  well  here's the truth   my opponent and i are both offering tax cuts  the difference is  he wants to give   billion in tax cuts to the biggest corporations in america  and he wants to give the average fortune   ceo a   tax cut  but he gives nothing at all to over   million americans  i have a different set of priorities  i'll give a middle class tax cut to   of all workers  and if you make less than   a year   which includes   percent of small business owners   you won't see your taxes increase one single dime  not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  we know that it's time to create the good paying jobs of tomorrow  ohio is hurting    jobs have been lost this year  you've got   percent unemployment  wages are flat lining  but it doesn't have to be this way  that's why i'm going to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  and start rebuilding the middle class by helping companies create jobs here in ohio  i will be a president who puts you first  ohio  because i believe in the american people and what we can do together  and if we want to turn this economy around and lead the world in the  st century  we have to create the high wage jobs of tomorrow right here in america  if i am president  i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new  green jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel efficient cars  jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from middle east dictators  i'll also put two million more americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads  schools  and bridges   because it is time to build an american infrastructure for the  st century  we will work with the building trades to expand apprenticeship programs so young workers can develop their skills  and if people ask how we're going to pay for this  you tell them that if we can spend   billion a month in iraq  we can spend some money to rebuild america  if i am president  i will finally fix our broken health care system  this issue is personal for me  my mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of   and i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed  fighting with her insurance company because they

for all of us  while my opponent wants to give   billion in tax cuts to the biggest corporations in america  and   a piece for the average fortune   ceo   i'll give a middle class tax cut to   of all workers  and if you make less than   a year  you won't see your taxes increase one single dime   not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  change means finally fixing our health care system  under my plan  if you have health insurance  the only thing that will change is that you'll pay lower premiums  if you don't have insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  we'll give small businesses a tax credit to pay   of the cost of covering their employees  and we'll tell insurance companies  no more discriminating against people with pre existing conditions  period  that's the change we need  change means giving every child  everywhere the skills and knowledge they need to compete with any worker  anywhere in the world  that means investing in early childhood education  and recruiting an army of new teachers  and making a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  if you commit to serving your country after you graduate  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together  we will move this country forward  finally  change means taking on the corruption in washington and on wall street to make sure a crisis like this can never happen again  i'll put in place common sense regulations to keep our market free and fair and restore accountability and responsibility in our boardrooms  and i'll go through the entire federal budget  line by line  and eliminate any spending that isn't helping our families  and you know where i'll start  by ending this war in iraq that's costing   billion a month while the iraqi government sits on tens of billions of dollars in surplus  i won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost  we will all need to sacrifice  and we will all need to pull our weight  because now more than ever  we are all in this together  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  it's a test we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves  we can do this  we've done it before  some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money  but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village  but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  and if you keep standing with me  if you keep fighting with me  if you keep making those calls  and knocking on those doors  and making sure everyone you know gets out to the polls on november  th   if you do these things  then i promise you  we will win this election  and then you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "we meet at a moment of great uncertainty for america  the economic crisis we face is the worst since the great depression  markets across the globe have become increasingly unstable  and millions of americans will open up their  k  statements this week and see that so much of their hard earned savings have disappeared  the credit crisis has left businesses large and small unable to get loans  which means they can't buy new equipment  or hire new workers  or even make payroll for the workers they have  you've got auto plants right here in ohio that have been around for decades closing their doors and laying off workers who've never known another job in their entire life    workers have lost their jobs this year  unemployment here in ohio is up   over the last eight years  which is the highest it's been in sixteen years  you've lost one of every four manufacturing jobs  the typical ohio family has seen their income fall   and it's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage  or fill up your gas tank  or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month  at this rate  the question isn't just  are you better off than you were four years ago  it's  are you better off than you were four weeks ago  i know these are difficult times  i know folks are worried  but i also know this   we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  because we are the united states of america  we are the country that has faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we have risen to meet these challenges   not as democrats  not as republicans  but as americans  we still have the most talented  most productive workers of any country on earth  we're still home to innovation and technology  colleges and universities that are the envy of the world  some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities  it won't be easy  but there's no reason we can't make this century another american century  but it will take a new direction  it will take new leadership in washington  it will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  my opponent has made his choice  last week  senator mccain's campaign announced that they were going to  turn the page  on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead  his campaign actually said  and i quote   if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  well senator mccain may be worried about losing an election  but i'm worried about americans who are losing their jobs  and their homes  and their life savings  they can't afford four more years of the economic theory that says we should give more and more to millionaires and billionaires and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  we've seen where that's led us and we're not going back  it's time to turn the page  over the course of this campaign  i've laid out a set of policies that will grow our middle class and strengthen our economy in the long term  i'll reform our tax code so that   of workers and their families get a tax cut  and eliminate income taxes for seniors making under   i'll bring down the cost of health care for families and businesses by investing in preventative care  new technology  and giving every american the chance to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress give themselves  we'll ensure every child can compete in the global economy by recruiting an army of new teachers and making college affordable for anyone who wants to go  we'll create five million new  high wage jobs by investing in the renewable sources of energy that will eliminate the oil we currently import from the middle east in ten years  and we'll create two million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads  schools  and bridges  but that's a long term strategy for growth  right now  we face an immediate economic emergency that requires urgent action  we can't wait to help workers and families and communities who are struggling right now   who don't know if their job or their retirement will be there tomorrow  who don't know if next week's paycheck will cover this month's bills  we need to pass an economic rescue plan for the middle class and we need to do it now  today i'm proposing a number of steps that we should take immediately to stabilize our financial system  provide relief to families and communities  and help struggling homeowners  it's a plan that begins with one word that's on everyone's mind  and it's spelled j o b s  we've already lost three quarters of a million jobs this year  and some experts say that unemployment may rise to   by the end of next year  we can't wait until then to start creating new jobs  that's why i'm proposing to give our businesses a new american jobs tax credit for each new employee they hire here in the united states over the next two years  to fuel the real engine of job creation in this country  i've also proposed eliminating all capital gains taxes on investments in small businesses and start up companies  and i've proposed an additional tax incentive through next year to encourage new small business investment  it is time to protect the jobs we have and to create the jobs of tomorrow by unlocking the drive  and ingenuity  and innovation of the american people  and we should fast track the loan guarantees we passed for our auto industry and provide more as needed so that they can build the energy efficient cars america needs to end our dependence on foreign oil  we will also save one million jobs by creating a jobs and growth fund that will provide money to states and local communities so that they can move forward with projects to rebuild and repair our roads  our bridges  and our schools  a lot of these projects and these jobs are at risk right now because of budget shortfalls  but this fund will make sure they continue  the second part of my rescue plan is to provide immediate relief to families who are watching their paycheck shrink and their jobs and life savings disappear  i've already proposed a middle class tax cut for   of workers and their families  but today i'm calling on congress to pass a plan so that the irs will mail out the first round of those tax cuts as soon as possible  we should also extend and expand unemployment benefits to those americans who have lost their jobs and are having a harder time finding new ones in this weak economy  and we should stop making them pay taxes on those unemployment insurance benefits as well  at a time when the ups and downs of the stock market have rarely been so unpredictable and dramatic  we also need to give families and retirees more flexibility and security when it comes to their retirement savings  i welcome senator mccain's proposal to waive the rules that currently force our seniors to withdraw from their  k s even when the market is bad  i think that's a good idea  but i think we need to do even more  since so many americans will be struggling to pay the bills over the next year  i propose that we allow every family to withdraw up to   from their ira or  k    up to a maximum of     without any fine or penalty throughout   this will help families get through this crisis without being forced to make painful choices like selling their homes or not sending their kids to college  the third part of my rescue plan is to provide relief for homeowners who are watching their home values decline while their property taxes go up  earlier this year i pushed for legislation that would help homeowners stay in their homes by working to modify their mortgages  when secretary paulson proposed his original financial rescue plan it included nothing for homeowners  when senator mccain was silent on the issue  i insisted that it include protections for homeowners  now the treasury must use the authority its been granted and move aggressively to help people avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes  we don't need a new law or a new   billion giveaway to banks like senator mccain has proposed  we just need to act quickly and decisively  i've already proposed a mortgage tax credit for struggling homeowners worth   of the interest you pay on your mortgage and we should move quickly to pass it  we should also change the unfair bankruptcy laws that allow judges to write down your mortgage if you own six or seven homes  but not if you have only one  and for all those cities and small towns that are facing a choice between cutting services like health care and education or raising property taxes  we will provide the funding to prevent those tax hikes from happening  we cannot allow homeowners and small towns to suffer because of the mess made by wall street and washington  for those americans in danger of losing their homes  today i'm also proposing a three month moratorium on foreclosures  if you are a bank or lender that is getting money from the rescue plan that passed congress  and your customers are making a good faith effort to make their mortgage payments and re negotiate their mortgages  you will not be able to foreclose on their home for three months  we need to give people the breathing room they need to get back on their feet  finally  this crisis has taught us that we cannot have a sound economy with a dysfunctional financial system  we passed a financial rescue plan that has the promise to help stabilize the financial system  but only if we act quickly  effectively and aggressively  the treasury department must move quickly with their plan to put more money into struggling banks so they have enough to lend  and they should do it in a way that protects taxpayers instead of enriching ceos  there was a report yesterday that some financial institutions participating in this rescue plan are still trying to avoid restraints on ceo pay  that's not just wrong  it's an outrage to every american whose tax dollars have been put at risk  no major investor would ever make an investment if they didn't think the corporation was being prudent and responsible  and we shouldn't expect taxpayers to think any differently  we should also be prepared to extend broader guarantees if it becomes necessary to stabilize our financial system  i also believe that treasury should not limit itself to purchasing mortgage backed securities   it should help unfreeze markets for individual mortgages  student loans  car loans  and credit card loans  and i think we need to do even more to make loans available in two very important areas of our economy  small businesses and communities  on friday  i proposed small business rescue plan that would create an emergency lending fund to lend money directly to small businesses that need cash for their payroll or to buy inventory  it's what we did after   and it allowed us to get low cost loans out to tens of thousands of small businesses  we'll also make it easier for private lenders to make small business loans by expanding the small business administration's loan guarantee program  by temporarily eliminating fees for borrowers and lenders  we can unlock the credit that small firms need to pay their workers and keep their doors open  and today  i'm also proposing that we maintain the ability of states and local communities that are struggling to maintain basic services without raising taxes to continue to get the credit they need  congress should pass this emergency rescue plan as soon as possible  if washington can move quickly to pass a rescue plan for our financial system  there's no reason we can't move just as quickly to pass a rescue plan for our middle class that will create jobs  provide relief  and help homeowners  and if congress does not act in the coming months  it will be one of the first things i do as president of the united states  because we can't wait any longer to start creating new jobs  to help struggling communities and homeowners  and to provide real and immediate relief to families who are worried not only about this month's bills  but their entire life savings  this plan will help ease those anxieties  and along with the other economic policies i've proposed  it will begin to create new jobs  grow family incomes  and put us back on the path to prosperity  i won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost  we'll have to set priorities as never before  and stick to them  that means pursuing investments in areas such as energy  education and health care that bear directly on our economic future  while deferring other things we can afford to do without  it means scouring the federal budget  line by line  ending programs that we don't need and making the ones we do work more efficiently and cost less  it also means promoting a new ethic of responsibility  part of the reason this crisis occurred is that everyone was living beyond their means   from wall street to washington to even some on main street  ceos got greedy  politicians spent money they didn't have  lenders tricked people into buying home they couldn't afford and some folks knew they couldn't afford them and bought them anyway  we've lived through an era of easy money  in which we were allowed and even encouraged to spend without limits  to borrow instead of save  now  i know that in an age of declining wages and skyrocketing costs  for many folks this was not a choice but a necessity  people have been forced to turn to credit cards and home equity loans to keep up  just like our government has borrowed from china and other creditors to help pay its bills  but we now know how dangerous that can be  once we get past the present emergency  which requires immediate new investments  we have to break that cycle of debt  our long term future requires that we do what's necessary to scale down our deficits  grow wages and encourage personal savings again  it's a serious challenge  but we can do it if we act now  and if we act as one nation  we can bring a new era of responsibility and accountability to wall street and to washington  we can put in place common sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again  we can make investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the  st century  we can restore a sense of fairness and balance that will give ever american a fair shot at the american dream  and above all  we can restore confidence   confidence in america  confidence in our economy  and confidence in ourselves  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  this is one of those moments  i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics  i understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what's been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history  i ask you to believe   to believe in yourselves  in each other  and in the future we can build together  together  we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  or pay their bills at the end of the month  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves  we can do this  americans have done this before  some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  together  we cannot fail  together  we can overcome the broken policies and divided politics of the last eight years  together  we can renew an economy that rewards work and rebuilds the middle class  together  we can create millions of new jobs  and deliver on the promise of health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  we can do this if we come together  if we have confidence in ourselves and each other  if we look beyond the darkness of the day to the bright light of hope that lies ahead  together  we can change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "],

even as you are worried about keeping your jobs or paying your bills or staying in your homes  my opponent's campaign announced earlier this month that they want to  turn the page  on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead  senator mccain's campaign actually said  and i quote   if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  well  new hampshire  last night we had a debate  i think you saw a bit of the mccain attack strategy in action  but here's what senator mccain doesn't seem to understand  with the economy in turmoil and the american dream at risk  the american people don't want to hear politicians attack each other   you want to hear about how we're going to attack the challenges facing middle class families each and every day  you want to hear about the issues that matter in your lives  you want to hear about how we're going to bring about the change that we desperately need for our country  that's what the american people want to hear  so let's debate our genuine differences on the issues that matter  last night  senator mccain said that george bush won't be on the ballot this november  but let's be clear  his policies will  because in three debates and over twenty months  john mccain hasn't explained a single thing that he would do differently from george bush when it comes to the most important economic issues we face today  not one  here's the truth  new hampshire  john mccain voted with george bush   percent of the time  that's not change   it's just more of the same  he wants to keep giving tax cuts to corporations that ship your jobs overseas  i want to give tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in america  he wants to give more tax cuts to fortune   ceos  i want to give   percent of working americans the tax relief they deserve  he wants to double down on a health care policy that only works for the healthy and the wealthy  i want to cut costs and expand coverage for all americans  he wants an energy policy that gives billions to the oil companies  an education policy that leaves our children behind  and a war in iraq that's costing us   billion a month while the iraqi government sits on a surplus   a war that you and i know must end  john mccain thinks this campaign is all about me   but the truth is  this campaign is about you  your jobs  your health care  your retirement  your children's future  that's what this election is about  that's what i'm fighting for  because i can take   more weeks of these attacks from john mccain  but the american people can't take four more years of the same failed policies and the same divisive politics  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  it is time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put wall street before main street but ended up hurting both  we need policies that grow our economy from the bottom up  so that every american  everywhere  has the chance to get ahead  not just the person who owns the factory  but the men and women who work on its floor  because if we've learned anything from this economic crisis  it's that we're all connected  we're all in this together  and we will rise or fall as one nation   as one people  the rescue plan that passed the congress was a necessary first step to easing this credit crisis  it's also important that we continue to work with governments around the globe to confront what is truly a global crisis  but now we need a rescue plan for the middle class  if we're going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up  it has to start on main street   not just the big banks on wall street  that's why i've outlined several steps that we have to take right now to help folks who are struggling  first  we've got to act now to create good paying jobs  we've already lost three quarters of a million jobs this year  and some experts say unemployment may rise to   by the end of next year  that's why i've proposed a new american jobs tax credit for each new employee that companies hire here in the united states over the next two years  that's how we'll create good  new american jobs  second  we need to help small businesses get back on their feet  to fuel the real engine of job creation in this country  i'll eliminate all capital gains taxes on investments in small businesses and start up companies  and provide an additional tax incentive through next year to encourage new small business investment  and we also need to make sure that small businesses can access the immediate loans they need to pay their workers and finance their inventory  third  we need to provide relief for homeowners who are watching their home values decline while property taxes go up  the treasury must use the authority it's been granted and move aggressively to help people avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes  we don't need a new law or a new   billion giveaway to banks like senator mccain has proposed  we just need to act quickly and decisively  for those responsible homeowners in danger of losing their homes  i've proposed a three month moratorium on foreclosures so that we give people the breathing room they need to get back on their feet  finally  we've got to help states and local governments that have been squeezed  this is a part of this crisis that hasn't gotten enough attention  if washington keeps pushing the burden on to states and cities and towns  you might be forced to raise new revenue through cuts in services or increases in taxes  today  twenty one states are facing budget short falls   including new hampshire  but the last thing we should be doing when families are struggling is forcing states and towns to choose between getting rid of essential programs or raising property taxes  you've got a great governor here in john lynch  what he needs is a strong partner in the white house  and that's what i'll be if i am president of the united states  last august  i called for a   billion fund to help states and local governments avoid property tax increases  if we had acted two months ago  new hampshire would have gotten the relief you need  we cannot afford to wait any longer  we need this fund to help new hampshire and states across the country pay for health care and education  police and firefighters  without resorting to tax or fee increases  we will also save one million jobs by creating a jobs and growth fund that will provide money to states and local communities so they can move forward with projects that put people to work rebuilding and repairing our roads  our bridges  and our schools  we also need a new lending facility that reaches out to states and localities   we can't extend a hand to banks on wall street without reaching out to main street so states can make payroll and deliver services  you need leadership in washington that's looking out for you   for the services you count on  for the jobs that our economy needs  for the change that will help the middle class  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  these are the steps that we must take   right now   to begin to get our economy back on track  but we also need a new set of priorities  bottom up growth depends on a tax code that doesn't just work for the folks at the top  you've heard a lot about taxes in this campaign  well  here's the truth   my opponent and i are both offering tax cuts  the difference is  he wants to give   billion in tax cuts to the biggest corporations in america  and he wants to give the average fortune   ceo a   tax cut  but he gives nothing at all to over   million americans  i have a different set of priorities  i'll give a middle class tax cut to   of all workers  and if you make less than   a year   which includes   percent of small business owners   you won't see your taxes increase one single dime  not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  because in an economy like this  the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  we know that it's time to create the good paying jobs of tomorrow  that's why i'm going to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  and start rebuilding the middle class by helping companies create jobs here in america  if i am president  i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new  green jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel efficient cars  jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from middle east dictators  i'll also put two million more americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads  schools  and bridges   because it is time to build an american infrastructure for the  st century  and if people ask how we're going to pay for this  you tell them that if we can spend   billion a month in iraq  we can spend some money to rebuild america  if i am president  i will finally fix our broken health care system  this issue is personal for me  my mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of   and i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed  fighting with her insurance company because they claimed that her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  if i am president  i will make sure those insurance companies can never do that again  my health care plan will make sure insurance companies can't discriminate against those who are sick and need care most  if you have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  and if you don't have health insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families  businesses  and the entire economy  that's the change we need  and we'll give every child  everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker  anywhere in the world  i will not allow countries to out teach us today so they can out compete us tomorrow  it is time to provide every american with a world class education  that means investing in early childhood education  that means recruiting an army of new teachers  and paying them better  and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability  and it means making a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  senator mccain's top economic advisor actually said the other day that they have no plan to invest in college affordability because we can't have a giveaway to every special interest  well i don't think the young people of america are a special interest   they are the future of this country  that's why i'll make this deal with you  if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together  we will move this country forward  finally  i will take on the corruption in washington and on wall street to make sure a crisis like this can never  ever happen again  i'll put in place the common sense regulations and rules of the road i've been calling for since march   rules that will keep our market free  fair  and honest  rules that will restore accountability and responsibility in our corporate boardrooms  and just as we demand accountability on wall street  i will also demand it in washington  that's why i'm not going to stand here and simply tell you what i'm going to spend  i'm going to tell you how we're going to save when i am president  i'll do what you do in your own family budgets and make sure we're spending money wisely  i will go through the entire federal budget  page by page  line by line  and eliminate programs that don't work and aren't needed  we'll start by ending a war in iraq that's cost us nearly a trillion dollars  and we'll save billions more by cutting waste  improving management  and strengthening oversight  these are the changes and reforms we need  a new era of responsibility and accountability on wall street and in washington  common sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again  investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the  st century  bottom up growth that gives every american a fair shot at the american dream  and above all confidence   confidence in america  confidence in our economy  and confidence in ourselves  i won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever  we are all in this together  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  this is one of those moments  i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics  i understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what's been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history  i ask you to believe   to believe in yourselves  in each other  and in the future we can build together  together  we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  or pay their bills at the end of the month  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves  we are   days away from changing this country    days  but for those who are getting a little cocky  i've got two words for you  new hampshire  i learned right here that you can't let up or pay too much attention to the polls  we've got to keep making our case for change  we've got to keep fighting for every vote  we've got to keep running through that finish line  this election is too important to take anything for granted  the future that you and i seek for our children is too important to let up now  the time for change has come we can do this  americans have done this before  some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  together  we cannot fail  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will win new hampshire  we will win this election  and then you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "thank you  thank you so much  thank you so much  thank you to al and to your eminence  to governor patterson and mayor bloomberg  to senator and mrs  mccain  to my wonderful colleague  senator clinton and schumer  to all the distinguished guests  there is no other crowd in the america that i'd rather be palling around with right now   laughter  i'm sorry he couldn't be here  i do send regards to my running mate  joe biden  or as senator mccain noted  he now actually likes to be called joe the senator  i was thrilled to get this invitation  and i feel right at home here  because it's often been said that i share the politics of alfred e  smith and the ears of alfred e  newman  but i have to say tonight's venue isn't really what i'm used to  i was originally told we'd be able to move this outdoors to yankee stadium  and can somebody tell me what happened to the greek columns that i requested  i do love the waldorf astoria  though  you know  i hear that from the doorstep you can see all the way to the russian tea room  it is an honor to be here with al smith  i obviously never knew your great grandfather  but from everything that senator mccain has told me  the two of them had a great time together before prohibition  so wonderful stories  the mayor of this great city  michael bloomberg  is here  the mayor recently announced some news   made some news by announcing he's going to be rewriting the rules and running for a third term  which caused bill clinton to say   you can do that  the president's better half  senator hillary rodham clinton  is also here  i'm glad to see you made it  hillary  i'm glad to see that you made it  because i heard chuck schumer actually try to tell you that we really did move this event to yankee stadium  but i'll tell you all from personal experience hillary clinton is one of the toughest and most formidable presidential candidates in history  she has broken barriers  she's inspired millions  she is the   she is the primary reason i have all this gray in my hair now  i am also glad to see that senator schumer is here  and i see that he's brought some of his loved ones  those would be the people with the cameras and the notebooks in the back of the room  of course  i am especially honored to be here tonight with my distinguished opponent  senator john mccain  i think it is a tribute to american democracy that  with two weeks left in a hard fought election  the two of us could come together and sit down at the same dinner table without preconditions  recently  one of john wants top advisors told the  daily news  that if we keep talking about the economy  mccain's going to lose  so tonight i'd like to talk about the economy  given all that's happened these past few weeks on wall street  it feels like an odd time to be dressed up in white tie  but i must say i got a great deal  i rented the whole outfit from the treasury department at a very good price  looking around tonight at all the gourmet food and champagne  it's clear that no expenses were spared  it's like an executive sales meeting at aig  but i don't need to tell any of you that it's been a scary time on the stock market with people losing their investments  their entire fortunes  it's gotten so bad bloomberg now has to take the subway  and while the collapse of the housing market has been tough on every single homeowner  i think we all need to recognize that this crisis has been eight times harder on john mccain  we have been debating a lot of these economic issues over the course of the campaign  but lately things have been getting a bit tougher  in the last few weeks john has been out on the campaign trail and asked the question   who is barack obama  i have to admit i was a little surprised by this question  the answer is right there on my facebook page  but look  i don't want to be coy about this  we're a couple weeks from an important election  americans have a big choice to make and  if anybody feels like they don't know me by now  let me try to give you some answers  who is barack obama  contrary to the rumors that you've heard  i was not born in a manger  i was actually born on krypton and sent here by my father jor el to save the planet earth  many of you   many of you know that i got my name barack from my father  what you may not know is barack is actually swahili for  that one  and i got my middle name from somebody who obviously didn't think i'd ever run for president  if i had to name my greatest strength  i guess it would be my humility  greatest weakness  it's possible that i'm a little too awesome  one other thing  i have never  not once  put lipstick on a pig  or a pit bull  or myself  rudy giuliani  that's one for you  i mean  who would have thought that a cross dressing mayor from new york city would have a tough time winning the republican nomination  it's shocking  that was a tough primary you had there  john  anyway   anyway  that's who i really am  but in the spirit of full disclosure  there are a few october surprises you'll be finding out about in the coming weeks  first of all  my middle name  it's not what you think  it's actually steve  that's right  barack steve obama  here's another revelation  john mccain is onto something  there was a point in my life when i started palling around with a pretty ugly crowd  i've got to be honest  these guys were serious dead beats  they were low lives  they were unrepentant  no good punks  that's right  i've been a member of the united states senate  come to think of it  john  i swear i saw you at one of our meetings  but i know senator mccain agrees that some of the rumors out there are getting a bit crazy  i mean  rupert the other day  fox news actually accused me of fathering two african american children in wedlock  by the way  john  i'm just curious  is fox news included in the media  because i'm always hearing about this love  just curious  then at one of these campaign rallies someone in the crowd started yelling  nobama  announcing to everyone in the room that i shouldn't be the democratic nominee because there were far more qualified candidates  i really wish joe biden hadn't done that  but at least  we've moved past the days when the main criticism coming from the mccain campaign was that i'm some kind of celebrity  i have to admit that that really hurt  i got so angry about it  i punched a paparazzi in the face on my way out of spagos  i'm serious  i even spilled my soy chai latte all over my tshi tzu  it was really embarrassing  but  in all seriousness  i'm so glad that i could make it tonight  and i'm honored to be among such wonderful public servants  i want to especially say a word of thanks to senator mccain  we are in the midst of a tough battle right now  and american politics at the presidential level is always tough  but i've said before  and i think it bears repeating that there are very few of us who have served this country with the same dedication and honor and distinction as senator mccain  and i'm glad to be sharing the stage with him tonight as i am during the course of this nomination  and before i close  i'd like to recognize one such servant who's not with us here tonight but who was mentioned earlier  and that's our good friend  tim russert  and i know that luke and maureen are here  and i know that tim enjoyed these dinners very much  and i also know how much he would have enjoyed covering this election  and i know that john and i would have been quaking in our boots preparing for our appearances on  meet the press  and his absence is not just a personal loss for so many who knew him and loved him but a profound loss for the country  and we continue to miss him very much  you know  the fact that each   each october in the closing weeks of a hard fought campaign  people of all political persuasions can come to this dinner and share a meal in honor of the work of this foundation underscores the reality that  no matter what differences or divisions or arguments we are having right now  we ultimately belong to something bigger and more lasting than a political party  we belong to a community  we share a country  we are all children of god  and in this country there are millions of fellow citizens  our brothers and sisters  who need us very much  especially now  we are being battered by a very serious economic storm  and for many americans it's only deepened the quiet storms they've been struggling through for years  beyond the walls of this hotel on the streets of one of the greatest cities in the wealthiest nation on earth  there are men and women and children who have fallen on hard times and hard luck  who can't find work on even a job that pays enough to keep a roof over their heads  and some are hanging on just by a thread  the scripture says god creates us for works of service  we are blessed to have so many organizations like this one in the catholic diocese that perform these acts of god every day  but each of us also have that responsibility  each of us has that obligation  especially now  so no matter who we are or what we do  what i believe is each of us in this room asks for and hopes for and prays for  enough strength and wisdom to do good and to seek justice and play our small part in building a more hopeful and compassionate world for the generations that will follow  before al smith was a candidate who made history  he was a man who made a difference  a man who fought for many years to give americans nothing more than a fair shake and a chance to succeed  and he touched the lives of hundreds of thousands  of millions as a result  simply put  he helped people  and that's a distinction we can all aspire to and we can all achieve  young or old  rich or poor  democrat or republican or independent  and i have no doubt that if we come together at this moment of crisis with this goal in mind  america will meet this challenge and weather this storm  and in the words of al smith  walk once more in eternal sunshine  thank you so much  everybody  god bless you "], ["obama1", "we meet at a moment of great uncertainty for america  the economic crisis we face is the worst since the great depression  as the stock market has plummeted  millions of americans have opened up their  k  statements to see that so much of their hard earned savings have disappeared  the credit crisis has left businesses large and small unable to get loans  which means they can't buy new equipment  or hire new workers  or even make payroll for the workers they have  in households across the country  it's getting harder and harder to get a loan for that new car or that startup business or that college you've dreamed of attending  wages are lower than they've been in nearly a decade  you're paying more for everything from gas to groceries  but your paychecks have flat lined  i know these are difficult times  i know folks are worried  but i believe that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis because i believe in this country  because this is the united states of america  this is a nation that has faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  the american story has never been about things coming easy   it's been about rising to the moment when the moment is hard  america can meet this moment  we have the most talented  most productive workers of any country on earth  we're home to innovation and technology  colleges and universities that are the envy of the world  some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and research facilities  it won't be easy  but there's no reason we can't make this century another american century  but missouri  i also know this  it will take a new direction  it will take new leadership in washington  it will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  even as we face the most serious economic crisis of our time  even as you are worried about keeping your jobs or paying your bills or staying in your homes  my opponent's campaign announced earlier this month that they want to  turn the page  on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead  senator mccain's campaign actually said  and i quote   if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  well  missouri  here's what my opponent doesn't seem to understand  with the economy in turmoil and the american dream at risk  the american people don't want to hear politicians attack each other   you want to hear about how we're going to attack the challenges facing middle class families each and every day  you want to hear about the issues that matter in your lives  you want to hear about how we're going to bring about the change that we desperately need for our country  that's what the american people want to hear  so let's talk about the issues that matter  in the debate this week  my opponent felt the need to inform me that he's not president bush  and in fairness  i don't blame senator mccain for all of president bush's mistakes  after all  he's only voted with george bush   percent of the time  but it is fair to say that over the course of three debates and twenty months  senator mccain still hasn't offered a single thing that he would do differently from george w  bush when it comes to the most important economic issues we face today  not one  just look at taxes  my opponent's been talking a lot about taxes in his campaign  but here's the truth missouri   we are both offering tax cuts  the difference is who we're cutting taxes for  it comes down to values   in america  do we simply value wealth  or do we value the work that creates it  for eight years  we've seen what happens when we put the extremely wealthy and well connected ahead of working people  now  john mccain thinks that the way to rebuild this economy is to double down on george bush's policy of giving more and more tax breaks to those at the very top in the false hope that it will all trickle down  i think it's time to rebuild the middle class in this country  and that is the choice in this election  senator mccain wants to give the average fortune   ceo a   tax cut but absolutely nothing at all to over   million americans  i want to cut taxes   cut taxes   for   percent of all workers  and under my plan  if you make less than   a year   which includes   percent of small business owners   you won't see your taxes increase one single dime  not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  it's time to give the middle class a break  and that's what i'll do as president of the united states  lately  senator mccain has been attacking my middle class tax cut  he actually said it goes to   those who don't pay taxes  even though it only goes to working people who are already getting taxed on their paycheck  that's right  missouri   john mccain is so out of touch with the struggles you are facing that he must be the first politician in history to call a tax cut for working people  welfare  the only  welfare  in this campaign is john mccain's plan to give another   billion in tax cuts to the wealthiest corporations in america   including   billion in tax breaks to big oil companies that ran up record profits under george bush  that's who john mccain is fighting for  but we can't afford four more years like the last eight  george bush and john mccain are out of ideas  they are out of touch  and if you stand with me in   days they will be out of time  we need new priorities in washington  i think it's time to give a tax cut to the teachers and janitors who work in our schools  to the cops and firefighters who keep us safe  to the waitresses working double shifts  the nurses in the er  and the plumbers fighting for their american dream  these workers are the backbone of our country  they are the ones that washington has forgotten  they're the ones i'll fight for  and while senator mccain ignores the payroll taxes you pay to score a few political points  i'll put a tax cut into the pockets of working people so you can pay the bills  put away some savings  and pass on a brighter future to your children  so senator mccain can keep trying to attack me and distract you   but it's not going to work  not this time   not now  because while my opponent thinks this campaign is all about me   the truth is  this campaign is about you  your jobs  your health care  your retirement  your children's future  that's what this election is about  that's what i'm fighting for  because i can take   more weeks of these attacks from john mccain  but the american people can't take four more years of the same failed policies and the same divisive politics  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  it is time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put wall street before main street but ended up hurting both  we need policies that grow our economy from the bottom up  so that every american  everywhere  has the chance to get ahead  not just the person who owns the factory  but the men and women who work on its floor  because if we've learned anything from this economic crisis  it's that we're all connected  we're all in this together  and we will rise or fall as one nation   as one people  the rescue plan that passed the congress was a necessary first step to easing this credit crisis  but now we need a rescue plan for the middle class  if we're going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up  it has to start on main street   not just the big banks on wall street  that's why i've outlined several steps that we have to take right now to help folks who are struggling  first  we've got to act now to create good paying jobs  we've already lost three quarters of a million jobs this year  that's why i've proposed a new american jobs tax credit for each new employee that companies hire here in the united states over the next two years  and that's why i'll stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and invest in companies that create good jobs right here in missouri  second  we need to help small businesses get back on their feet  to fuel the real engine of job creation in this country  i'll eliminate all capital gains taxes on investments in small businesses and start up companies  and provide an additional tax incentive through next year to encourage new small business investment  and we'll also make sure that small businesses can access the immediate loans they need to pay their workers and finance their inventory  third  we need to provide relief for homeowners  the treasury must use the authority it's been granted and move aggressively to help people avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes  we don't need a new law or a new   billion giveaway to banks like senator mccain has proposed  we just need to act quickly and decisively  for those responsible homeowners in danger of losing their homes  i've proposed a three month moratorium on foreclosures so that we give people the breathing room they need to get back on their feet  finally  we've got to help states and local governments that have been squeezed  today  twenty one states are facing budget short falls  and they might be forced to cut services or raise taxes  that's why i'm going to create a   billion fund to help states and local governments pay for health care and education  police and firefighters  without having to raise your taxes  and we'll save one million jobs by creating a jobs and growth fund that will help states move forward with projects to rebuild and repair our roads  our bridges  and our schools  these are the steps that we must take   right now   to start getting our economy back on track  but we also need a new set of priorities to grow our economy and create jobs over the long term  if i am president  i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new  green jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel efficient cars  jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from middle east dictators  i'll also put two million more americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads  schools  and bridges   because it is time to build an american infrastructure for the  st century  and if people ask how we're going to pay for this  you tell them that if we can spend   billion a month in iraq  we can spend some money to rebuild america  if i am president  i will finally fix our broken health care system  this issue is personal for me  my mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of   and i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed  fighting with her insurance company because they claimed that her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  if i am president  i will make sure those insurance companies can never do that again  my health care plan will make sure insurance companies can't discriminate against those who are sick and need care most  if you have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  if you don't have health insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  and we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families  businesses  and the entire economy  that's the change we need  senator mccain has been eager to share some details of his health care plan   but not all  first  we found out that he wants to pay for his plan by taxing your health care benefits for the first time in history  just like george bush  that was bad enough  but it turns out  senator mccain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in medicare   billion worth  under his plan  if you count on medicare  you would have fewer places to get care  and less freedom to choose your doctors  you'll pay more for your drugs  receive fewer services  and get lower quality care  i think every single american has a right to affordable accessible health care  we can strengthen medicare by eliminating wasteful subsidies to big hmos in medicare  and making sure seniors can access home based care  and letting medicare negotiate with drug companies for better prices  that's the kind of change we need  and if i'm president  we'll give every child  everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker  anywhere in the world  i will not allow countries to out teach us today so they can out compete us tomorrow  it is time to provide every american with a world class education  that means investing in early childhood education  that means recruiting an army of new teachers  and paying them better  and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability  and it means making a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  my opponent's top economic advisor actually said that they have no plan to invest in college affordability because we can't have a giveaway to every special interest  well i don't think the young people of america are a special interest   they are the future of this country  that's why i'll make this deal with you  if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  no ifs  ands or buts  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together  we will move this country forward  finally  i will take on the corruption in washington and on wall street to make sure a crisis like this can never  ever happen again  i'll put in place the common sense regulations and rules of the road i've been calling for since march   rules that will keep our market free  fair  and honest  rules that will restore accountability and responsibility in our corporate boardrooms  and just as we demand accountability on wall street  i will also demand it in washington  that's why i'm not going to stand here and simply tell you what i'm going to spend  i'm going to tell you how we're going to save when i am president  i'll do what you do in your own family budgets and make sure we're spending money wisely  i will go through the entire federal budget  page by page  line by line  and eliminate programs that don't work and aren't needed  we'll start by ending a war in iraq that's cost us nearly a trillion dollars  and we'll save billions more by cutting waste  improving management  and strengthening oversight  these are the changes and reforms we need  a new era of responsibility and accountability on wall street and in washington  common sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again  investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the  st century  bottom up growth that gives every american a fair shot at the american dream  and above all confidence   confidence in america  confidence in our economy  and confidence in ourselves  i won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever  we are all in this together  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  this is one of those moments  i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics  i understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what's been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history  i ask you to believe   to believe in yourselves  in each other  and in the future we can build together  together  we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  or pay their bills at the end of the month  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves  we are   days away from changing this country    days  but for those who are getting a little cocky  i've got two words for you  new hampshire  that's where i learned   with the help of my great friend and supporter hillary clinton   that you can't let up or pay too much attention to the polls  we've got to keep making our case for change  we've got to keep fighting for every vote  we've got to keep running through that finish line  this election is too important to take anything for granted  the future that you and i seek for our children is too important to let up now  the time for change has come  we can do this  americans have done this before  some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  together  we cannot fail  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote on november  th  and if you do  i promise you   we will win missouri  we will win this election  and then you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "before we begin  i'd like to acknowledge some news we learned this morning  with so many brave men and women from fayetteville serving in our military  this is a city and a state that knows something about great soldiers  and this morning  a great soldier  a great statesman  and a great american has endorsed our campaign to change america  i have been honored to have the benefit of his wisdom and counsel from time to time over the last few years  but today  i am beyond honored and deeply humbled to have the support of general colin powell  general powell has defended this nation bravely  and he has embodied our highest ideals through his long and distinguished public service  he and his wife alma have inspired millions of young people to serve their communities and their country through their tireless commitment and trailblazing american story  and he knows  as we do  that this is a moment where we all need to come together as one nation   young and old  rich and poor  black and white  republican and democrat  this is a moment to stand up and serve because this is a moment of great uncertainty for america  the economic crisis we face is the worst since the great depression  businesses large and small are finding it impossible to get loans  which means they can't buy new equipment  or hire new workers  or even make payroll for the workers they have    workers have lost their jobs this year  wages are lower than they've been in a decade  at a time when the cost of health care and college have never been higher  it's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage  or fill up your gas tank  or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month  at this rate  the question isn't just  are you better off than you were four years ago  it's  are you better off than you were four weeks ago  so i know these are difficult times  i know folks are worried  but i believe that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis because i believe in this country  because i believe in you   the american people  we are the united states of america  we are a nation that's faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we have risen to meet these challenges   not as democrats  not as republicans  but as americans  with resolve  with confidence  with that fundamental belief that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  that's who we are  and that's the country we need to be right now  but north carolina  i know this  it will take a new direction  it will take new leadership in washington  it will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  now  my opponent has made his choice  senator mccain's campaign actually said a couple of weeks ago that they were going to launch a series of attacks on my character because  they said   if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  and that's one promise john mccain has kept  he's been on the attack  lately  he and governor palin have actually accused me of   get this   socialism  john mccain just repeated the charge again this morning  and you know why  because i want to give a tax cut to the middle class   a tax cut to   of american workers  these are folks who work hard every single day and get payroll taxes taken out of their paycheck every single week  these are the teachers and janitors who work in our schools  they're the cops and firefighters who keep us safe  they're the waitresses who work double shifts  the cashiers at wal mart  the plumbers fighting for the american dream  john mccain thinks that giving these americans a break is socialism  well i call it opportunity  and there is nothing more american than that  if john mccain wants to talk about redistributing wealth to those who don't need it and don't deserve it  let's talk about the   tax cut he wants to give fortune   ceos  who've been making out like bandits   some of them literally  let's talk about the   billion he wants to give to the same wall street banks that got us into this mess  let's talk about the   billion he wants to give oil companies like exxon mobil or the   billion he wants to give the biggest corporations in america  let's talk about the   million middle class americans who john mccain doesn't want to give a single dime of tax relief  don't tell me that ceos and oil companies deserve a tax break before the men and women who are working overtime day after day and still can't pay the bills  that's not right  and that's not change  i promise you this   not only will the middle class get a tax cut under my plan  but if you make less than   a year   which includes   percent of small business owners   you won't see your taxes increase one single dime  not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  that is my commitment to you  here's the truth  north carolina  this debate   and this election   comes down to what we value  in the america i know  we don't just value wealth  we value the work and workers who create it  for the last eight years  we have tried it john mccain's way  we have tried it george bush's way  we've given more and more to those with the most and hoped that prosperity would trickle down to everyone else  and guess what  it didn't  so it's time try something new  it's time to grow this economy from the bottom up  it's time to invest in the middle class again  north carolina  the other side trots out this attack every year  in every election  it's a scare tactic  it's the oldest trick in the book  and it's what you do when you are out of ideas  out of touch  and running out of time  well not this year  not this time  i can take a few more weeks of john mccain's attacks  but the american people can't take four more years of the same failed policies and the same failed politics  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  it is time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put wall street before main street but ended up hurting both  we need policies that grow our economy from the bottom up  so that every american  everywhere  has the chance to get ahead  not just the person who owns the factory  but the men and women who work on its floor  because if we've learned anything from this economic crisis  it's that we're all connected  we're all in this together  and we will rise or fall as one nation   as one people  the rescue plan that passed the congress was a necessary first step to easing this credit crisis  but if we're going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up  we need an immediate rescue plan for the middle class   and that's what i will do as president of the united states  i've proposed a new american jobs tax credit for each new employee that companies hire here in the united states over the next two years  and i'll stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and invest in companies that create good jobs right here in north carolina  i'll help small businesses get back on their feet by eliminating capital gains taxes and giving them emergency loans to keep their doors open and hire workers  i'll put a three month moratorium on foreclosures so that we give homeowners the breathing room they need to get back on their feet  and i will create a jobs and growth fund to help states and local governments save one million jobs and pay for health care and education without having to raise your taxes  these are the steps that we must take   right now   to start getting our economy back on track  but we also need a new set of priorities to grow our economy and create jobs over the long term  if i am president  i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new  green jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel efficient cars  jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from middle east dictators  i'll also put two million more americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads  schools  and bridges   because it is time to build an american infrastructure for the  st century  and if people ask how we're going to pay for this  you tell them that if we can spend   billion a month in iraq  we can spend some money to rebuild america  if i am president  i will finally fix the problems in our health care system that we've been talking about for too long  this issue is personal for me  my mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of   and i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed  fighting with her insurance company because they claimed that her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  if i am president  i will make sure those insurance companies can never do that again  my health care plan will make sure insurance companies can't discriminate against those who are sick and need care most  if you have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  if you don't have health insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  and we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families  businesses  and the entire economy  that's the change we need  and if i'm president  we'll give every child  everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker  anywhere in the world  i will not allow countries to out teach us today so they can out compete us tomorrow  it is time to provide every american with a world class education  that means investing in early childhood education  that means recruiting an army of new teachers  and paying them better  and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability  and it means making a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  my opponent's top economic advisor actually said that they have no plan to invest in college affordability because we can't have a giveaway to every special interest  well i don't think the young people of america are a special interest   they are the future of this country  that's why i'll make this deal with you  if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  no ifs  ands or buts  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together  we will move this country forward  now  i won't pretend that any of this will come easy or without cost  we will all need to tighten our belts  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever  we are all in this together  earlier i mentioned general powell and how grateful i am for his support  but i am even more grateful for what he said about the nature of this campaign  because colin powell reminded us of what's at stake in this election   for america and for the world  he reminded us that at a defining moment like this  we don't have the luxury of relying on the same political games and the same political tactics that are used every election to divide us from one another and make us afraid of one another  we have seen some of these tactics from the other side and they will get even uglier and more intense in these last sixteen days  you will get more telephone calls  and more flyers in the mail  and you will hear more outrageous attacks calculated to mislead  inflame  and divide  the other side will continue to make a big election about small things  but no matter what they do  you will have the chance to walk into that voting booth  and close that curtain  and say   not this time  not this year  with the challenges and the crises we face right now  this is not a time to divide this country by class or region  by who we are or what policies we support  there are no real or fake parts of this country  we are not separated by the pro america and anti america parts of this nation   we all love this country  no matter where we live or where we come from  there are patriots who supported this war in iraq and patriots who opposed it  patriots who believe in democratic policies and those who believe in republican policies  the men and women from fayetteville and all across america who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents  but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag  they have not served a red america or a blue america   they have served the united states of america  we have always been at our best when we've had leadership that called us to look past our differences and come together as one nation  as one people  leadership that rallied this entire country to a common purpose   to a higher purpose  and i run for the presidency of the united states of america because that is the country we need to be right now  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed the same divisions and fear tactics and our own petty differences plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  this is one of those moments  i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics  i understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what's been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history  i ask you to believe   to believe in yourselves  in each other  and in the future we can build together  together  we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  or pay their bills at the end of the month  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves  we can do this  americans have done this before  some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  together  we cannot fail  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote today  in north carolina  starting today  you can early vote right here  and right now  and if you do  i promise you   we will win north carolina  we will win this election  and then you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "hello  tampa  and congratulations to your rays  it's great to be back in the sunshine state  and in just   days  you and i can begin to bring some badly needed sunshine to washington dc  that's the good news  but we're going to have to work  and struggle  and fight for every single one of those   days to bring our country the change we need  i am hopeful about the outcome  we were thrilled yesterday when a great american statesman  general colin powell  joined our cause  but we cannot let up  and we won't  because one thing we know is that change never comes without a fight  in the final days of campaigns  the say anything  do anything politics too often takes over  we've seen it before  and we're seeing it again today  the ugly phone calls  the misleading mail and tv ads  the careless  outrageous comments  all aimed at keeping us from working together  all aimed at stopping change  it's getting so bad that even senator mccain's running mate denounced his tactics last night  as you know  you really have to work hard to violate governor palin's standards on negative campaigning  but we're not going to be distracted  we're not going to be diverted  not this time  not this year  our challenges are too great for a politics that's so small  now  more than ever  this campaign has to be about the problems facing the american people   because this is a moment of great uncertainty for america  the economic crisis we face is the worst since the great depression  businesses large and small are finding it impossible to get loans  which means they can't buy new equipment  or hire new workers  or even make payroll for the workers they have    workers lost their jobs in florida this year  more than any other state in this country  wages are lower than they've been in a decade  at a time when the cost of health care and college have never been higher  it's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage  or fill up your gas tank  or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month  at this rate  the question isn't just  are you better off than you were four years ago  it's  are you better off than you were four weeks ago  so i know these are difficult times  i know folks are worried  but i believe that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis because i believe in this country  because i believe in you  i believe in the american people  we are the united states of america  we are a nation that's faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we have risen to meet these challenges   not as democrats  not as republicans  but as americans  with resolve  with confidence  with that fundamental belief that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  that's who we are  and that's the country we need to be right now  but florida  i know this  it will take a new direction  it will take new leadership in washington  it will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years  and that's what this election is all about  now  my opponent has made his choice  senator mccain's campaign actually said a couple of weeks ago that they were going to launch a series of attacks on my character because  they said   if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  and that's a promise john mccain has kept  he's been on the attack  that's what you do when you are out of ideas  out of touch  and running out of time  well  i can take a few more weeks of john mccain's attacks  but the american people can't take four more years of the same failed policies and the same failed politics  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  we have tried it john mccain's way  we have tried it george bush's way  it hasn't worked  it's time for something new  it is time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put wall street before main street but ended up hurting both  we need policies that grow our economy from the bottom up  so that every american  everywhere  has the chance to get ahead  not just the person who owns the factory  but the men and women who work on its floor  because if we've learned anything from this economic crisis  it's that we're all connected  we're all in this together  and we will rise or fall as one nation   as one people  the rescue plan that passed congress was a necessary first step to easing this credit crisis  but if we're going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up  we need an immediate rescue plan for the middle class   and that's what i'll offer as president of the united states  last week  i laid out a plan that will jumpstart job creation  provide relief to families  and rebuild our financial system  it's a plan that will also help struggling homeowners stay in their homes   something that's particularly important here in florida  where foreclosures are up   over the last year  all across this state  there are families who've done everything right  but who are now facing foreclosure or seeing their home values decline because of bad decisions on wall street and in washington  the other week  senator mccain came out with a proposal that he said would help ease the burden on homeowners by buying up bad mortgages at face value  even though they're not worth that much anymore  but here's the thing  florida  his plan would amount to a   billion bailout for wall street banks  and guess what  it would all be paid for by you  the american taxpayer  that might sound like a good idea to the former bank lobbyists running my opponent's campaign  but that's not the change america needs  look  we must act quickly to end this housing crisis  that's why last march  i was calling for us to help innocent home buyers  and that's why i fought to make sure the recent rescue package gives treasury the responsibility and authority to help homeowners avoid foreclosure  but we should not put your tax dollars at unnecessary risk  we should not let banks and lenders off the hook when it was their greed and irresponsibility that got us into this mess  we should not be bailing out wall street   we should be restoring opportunity on main street  and that's what i'll do when i'm president of the united states  if the american people are going to put up   billion to rescue our financial institutions  we should make sure those institutions are doing their part for the american people  that's why i've called for a three month moratorium on foreclosures  if you are a bank or lender that is getting money from the rescue plan  and your customers are making a good faith effort to make their mortgage payments and re negotiate their mortgages  you will not be able to foreclose on their home for three months  now  we've also put in place long term measures to restore our credit markets and help families refinance their mortgages  but until those measures start working  we need to help homeowners stay in their homes  and that's what this foreclosure freeze will do  and while we're at it  there's another step we can take to help innocent homeowners that won't cost taxpayers a dime  right now  if you own only one home  you're not allowed to write down your mortgage in bankruptcy court  but if you own more than one home   if you own  say  six or seven homes like my opponent   you are allowed to write down your mortgage  that might help senator mccain sleep easier at night  but it isn't right  and it will change when i'm president of the united states  but understand  if we're serious about restoring opportunity for our middle class  it's not enough to help people refinance their mortgages  it's not enough to protect your homes from foreclosure  we have to help the hardworking families who are living in those homes with shrinking paychecks and rising costs  that starts with tax relief  there's been a lot of talk about taxes in this campaign  and the truth is  my opponent and i are both proposing tax cuts  the difference is  he wants to give a   tax cut to fortune   ceos  i want to put a   tax cut in the pockets of   of american workers  that's right     my opponent doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  it's true that i want to roll back the bush tax cuts on the wealthiest americans and go back to the rate they paid under bill clinton  john mccain calls that socialism  what he forgets is that just a few years ago  he himself said those bush tax cuts were irresponsible  he said he couldn't  in good conscience  support a tax cut where the benefits went to the wealthy at the expense of  middle class americans who most need tax relief  well  he was right then  and i am right now  and let me be crystal clear  if you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year   which includes   of small business owners   you won't see your taxes increase one single dime  not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  that is my commitment to you  to create more american jobs  i've proposed a tax credit for each new employee that companies hire here in the united states over the next two years  and i'll stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and invest in companies that create good jobs right here in florida  i'll help small businesses get back on their feet

time for a change  i know it  you know it  and the american people know it  the other week  i was in ohio  and i went to this small town called georgetown  now  i was hungry and i needed a snack  so i asked where i could find the best pie in town  and folks pointed to this diner  so i went there  and as i'm waiting for a pie  some of the employees said   senator  can you please take a picture with us because the owner is a die hard republican and we want to poke him a little  and just then  the owner comes out  and i said   sir  i understand you're a die hard republican  he said yes  and i said   well  how's business  he said   not so good because my customers can't afford to eat out right now  so i said   well  who do you think has been running the economy for the last eight years  and he said   the republicans  well  i said   if you keep hitting your head against a wall and it starts to hurt  at some point don't you stop hitting it against the wall  maybe you should try the democrats for a change  now  make no mistake  the change we need won't come easy or without cost  we will all need to tighten our belts  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight

you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "i want to thank you all for joining us here in florida today for this economic summit  we meet at a moment of great uncertainty for america  the economic crisis we face is the worst since the great depression  businesses large and small are finding it impossible to get loans  which means they can't buy new equipment  or hire new workers  or even make payroll for the workers they have  we've lost more than   jobs this year   and we just learned that here in florida  we lost nearly   jobs in september alone  wages are lower than they've been in a decade  at a time when the cost of health care and college have never been higher  earlier this month  with major financial institutions on the verge of collapse and global markets on the brink  we took unprecedented action and passed a   billion rescue plan  i have no doubt this was the right thing to do to address the immediate crisis and put our economy on firmer footing  but it was also just the beginning   not the end   of our work to rebuild our struggling economy  some of the folks on this stage know this better than just about anyone  they are on the front lines  dealing with the fallout from eight years of greed on wall street and irresponsibility in washington  when we spend   billion a month in iraq  that means less money to fix crumbling roads and bridges here at home  when our president passes tax breaks for big corporations and multimillionaires  that leaves our states without the resources to provide health care and good schools and police and firefighters  today  twenty one states are facing budget shortfalls   including florida  and governors across america are facing an impossible choice  cut vital services or raise property taxes on families already struggling to stay afloat  now  let's be clear  the financial crisis that states  businesses and families are facing didn't just spring up full blown overnight  this has been a long time coming  and the warning signs have been very clear  but while president bush and senator mccain were ready to move heaven and earth to address the crisis on wall street  president bush has failed to address the crisis on main street   and senator mccain has failed to fully acknowledge it  instead of commonsense solutions  month after month  they've offered little more than willful ignorance  wishful thinking  and outdated ideology  nine months ago   back in january   i called for a stimulus plan to provide immediate relief for states  along with tax rebates to get money directly to middle class families and a foreclosure prevention fund to help them keep their homes  senator mccain  on the other hand  insisted that the fundamentals of the economy were strong  and his advisors openly mocked the stimulus plan before congress   one referred to it  and i quote  as  borrowing money from the chinese and dropping it from helicopters  another dismissed it as  junk  last august  i called for a jobs and growth fund to help states put people to work rebuilding and repairing our roads  bridges and schools  and i called for   billion to help states and local governments pay for services and avoid raising property taxes  because tax increases are the last thing our families need in an economy like this  but president bush and senator mccain thought that a second stimulus package was unnecessary  finally  after nine straight months of job losses and the worst market turmoil in generations  at a time when even the bush white house has acknowledged the need for a second stimulus  senator mccain put forth a plan   and it's fair to say  it leaves a lot to be desired  it's a proposal that does nothing to create jobs  it's an emergency plan that does nothing to help families with the emergencies of lost jobs and falling wages and mounting bills  it contains a housing proposal that offers a   billion bailout for wall street banks   but does little to help middle class families stay in their homes  in short  it's an economic proposal that does nothing to rebuild our economy  but everything to continue the same failed policies of the past eight years   when speculators gamed the system  regulators looked the other way  and lobbyists bought their way into our government  it's the same failed politics of decrying greed on wall street one minute  and then rewarding that greed the next minute with tax cuts for wall street corporations and ceos  it's the same failed philosophy  give more and more to those with the most and hope prosperity trickles down to everyone else  you know  it's funny   yesterday  i heard senator mccain say that i'm more concerned with who gets your piece of the pie than with growing the pie  but make no mistake about it  after eight years of bush mccain economics  the pie is now shrinking  that means lower wages and declining incomes and plummeting home values and rising unemployment  so we've seen what they offer  we've seen where it leads  this economic crisis is the final verdict on their failed leadership   and it's time for something new  i know these are difficult times  but i believe that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  because i believe in this country  i believe in the american people  and i believe in the leaders here at this table and across america who understand what families are going through  and have been on the frontlines  meeting our challenges head on   helping small businesses take off  harnessing renewable energy and information technology to create  st century jobs  reforming schools and training workers to succeed in the global economy  that's why we're here today   because a crisis like this calls for the best ideas  the brightest minds  the most innovative solutions from every corner of this country  these leaders need and deserve a partner in the white house   a president who understands that our prosperity doesn't come from wall street or washington  but from the hard work and ingenuity of our people  so we should be investing in their productivity and working to create the high wage  high skill jobs that support our families and strengthen our economy  and that is exactly what i'll do if i'm elected president  i'll start by creating a new american jobs tax credit for each new employee that companies hire here in the united states over the next two years  i'll stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and invest in companies that create good jobs right here in florida  and i'll help small businesses get back on their feet by eliminating capital gains taxes and giving them emergency loans to keep their doors open and hire workers  these are a few of the steps we must take right now to start getting our economy back on track  but we also need a new set of priorities to create jobs and grow our economy over the long term  that means investing in renewable energy  i've proposed   billion a year to create five million new green jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel efficient cars  jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from middle east dictators  i also plan to put two million more americans to work fixing our crumbling roads  schools and bridges  because it's time to build an american infrastructure for the twenty first century  if we can spend   billion a month rebuilding iraq  we can certainly spend some money to rebuild america  now  i know that none of this will come easy or without cost  but i'm confident that we're ready to meet this challenge  over the past twenty months  i've met folks all across this country who work that extra shift  and take that last bus home because they want more for their kids  they work long hours and face long odds without complaint or regret  they're not asking government to solve all their problems   they're just asking for a chance to work hard and provide for their families and contribute to this country  that's why i'm running for president   to give them that chance and rebuild our economy and ensure that our children and grandchildren have the same opportunities that we had  i'd now like to open up a discussion with the folks here on stage with me and have a chance to hear their thoughts and ideas "], ["obama1", "hello  miami  it's great to be here today in the sunshine state  and in just   days  you and i can begin to bring some badly needed sunshine to washington dc  that's the good news  but we're going to have to work  and struggle  and fight for every single one of those   days to bring our country the change we need  i am hopeful about the outcome  we were thrilled this weekend when a great american statesman  general colin powell  joined our cause  but we cannot let up  and we won't  because one thing we know is that change never comes without a fight  in the final days of campaigns  the say anything  do anything politics too often takes over  we've seen it before  and we're seeing it again today  the ugly phone calls  the misleading mail and tv ads  the careless  outrageous comments  all aimed at keeping us from working together  all aimed at stopping change  it's getting so bad that even senator mccain's running mate has denounced his tactics  as you know  you really have to work hard to violate governor palin's standards on negative campaigning  this morning  i had the opportunity to catch a little of senator mccain's speech in pennsylvania on tv  anyone see that  it was really amazing  he's decided to make up this notion that i've been attacking joe the plumber  even though just yesterday  joe himself said that's not true  and even though he knows full well that my plan will cut taxes for working joes and small businesspeople all across this country to help them pursue their dreams  because i want to help rebuild the middle class that has taken such a hit these past eight years under the policies of george bush and john mccain  and when senator mccain calls me a  socialist  and says i want to give a tax cut to people who don't pay taxes  he knows that's not true  my middle class tax cuts are for people who work and pay taxes  apparently senator mccain's decided that if he can't beat our ideas  he'll make up others and run against those  well  what we need now is not straw men and misleading charges  what we need is honest leadership and real change  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  now  more than ever  this campaign has to be about the problems facing the american people   because this is a moment of great uncertainty for america  the economic crisis we face is the worst since the great depression  businesses large and small are finding it impossible to get loans  which means they can't buy new equipment  or hire new workers  or even make payroll for the workers they have  we've lost more than   jobs this year   and we just learned that here in florida  we lost nearly   jobs in september alone  wages are lower than they've been in a decade  at a time when the cost of health care and college have never been higher  it's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage  or fill up your gas tank  or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month  at this rate  the question isn't just  are you better off than you were four years ago  it's  are you better off than you were four weeks ago  so i know these are difficult times  i know folks are worried  but i believe that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis because i believe in this country  because i believe in you  i believe in the american people  we are the united states of america  we are a nation that's faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we have risen to meet these challenges   not as democrats  not as republicans  but as americans  with resolve  with confidence  with that fundamental belief that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  that's who we are  and that's the country we need to be right now  but florida  i know this  it will take a new direction  it will take new leadership in washington  it will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years  and that's what this election is all about  because the truth is  the financial crisis we're facing didn't just spring up full blown overnight  this has been a long time coming  and the warning signs have been very clear  but while president bush and senator mccain were ready to move heaven and earth to address the crisis on wall street  president bush has failed to address the crisis on main street   and senator mccain has failed to fully acknowledge it  instead of commonsense solutions  month after month  they've offered little more than willful ignorance  wishful thinking  and outdated ideology  nine months ago   back in january   i called for a stimulus plan to provide immediate relief for states  along with tax rebates to get money directly to middle class families and a foreclosure prevention fund to help people keep their homes  senator mccain  on the other hand  insisted that the fundamentals of the economy were strong  his advisors openly mocked the stimulus plan before congress   one referred to it  and i quote  as  borrowing money from the chinese and dropping it from helicopters  another dismissed it as  junk  last august  i called for a jobs and growth fund to help states put people to work rebuilding and repairing our roads  bridges and schools  and i called for   billion to help states and local governments pay for services and avoid raising property taxes  because tax increases are the last thing our families need in an economy like this  but president bush and senator mccain thought that a second stimulus package was unnecessary  and today  after nine straight months of job losses  when our federal reserve chairman supports another stimulus to get our economy moving   something even the bush administration is open to   senator mccain's economic advisor made it clear that senator mccain still isn't ready to support a stimulus  he's taking a wait and see approach  and instead of offering a real plan to boost our economy  senator mccain has offered a proposal that does nothing to create jobs  nothing to help families with falling wages and mounting bills  and next to nothing to help people stay in their homes  instead  he's calling for a housing proposal that's nothing but a   billion bailout for wall street banks  well  i've got news for senator mccain  hard working families who've been hard hit by this economic crisis   folks who can't pay their mortgages or their medical bills or send their kids to college   they can't afford to wait and see  they can't afford to go to the back of the line behind ceos and wall street banks  they need help right here  right now   and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  you know  it's funny   recently  i heard senator mccain say that i'm more concerned with who gets your piece of the pie than with growing the pie  but make no mistake about it  after eight years of bush mccain economics  the pie is shrinking  that means lower wages and declining incomes and plummeting home values and rising unemployment  so my opponent is doing his best to change the subject and try to distract attention from the economy  senator mccain's campaign actually said a couple of weeks ago that they were going to launch a series of attacks on my character because  they said   if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  and that's a promise john mccain has kept  he's been on the attack  that's what you do when you are out of ideas  out of touch  and running out of time  well  i can take a few more weeks of john mccain's attacks  but the american people can't take four more years of the same failed policies and the same failed politics  it's time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put wall street before main street but ended up hurting both  we need policies that grow our economy from the bottom up  so that every american  everywhere  has the chance to get ahead  not just the person who owns the factory  but the men and women who work on its floor  because if we've learned anything from this economic crisis  it's that we're all connected  we're all in this together  and we will rise or fall as one nation   as one people  the rescue plan that passed congress was a necessary first step to easing this credit crisis  but if we're going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up  we need an immediate rescue plan for the middle class   and that's what i'll offer as president of the united states  that starts with tax relief  there's been a lot of talk about taxes in this campaign  and the truth is  my opponent and i are both proposing tax cuts  the difference is  he wants to give a   tax cut to the average fortune   ceo  i want to put a middle class tax cut in the pockets of   of workers and their families  my opponent doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  it's true that i want to roll back the bush tax cuts on the wealthiest americans and go back to the rate they paid under bill clinton  john mccain calls that socialism  what he forgets is that just a few years ago  he himself said those bush tax cuts were irresponsible  he said he couldn't  in good conscience  support a tax cut where the benefits went to the wealthy at the expense of  middle class americans who most need tax relief  well  he was right then  and i am right now  and let me be crystal clear  if you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year   which includes   of small business owners   you won't see your taxes increase one single dime  not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  that is my commitment to you  to create more american jobs  i've proposed a tax credit for each new employee that companies hire here in the united states over the next two years  i'll stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and invest in companies that create good jobs right here in florida  and i'll help small businesses get back on their feet by eliminating capital gains taxes and giving them emergency loans to keep their doors open and hire workers  i'll also ensure that we act quickly to help struggling homeowners stay in their homes   something that's particularly important here in florida  where foreclosures are up   over the past year  i'll help responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages on affordable terms and put in place a three month moratorium on foreclosures to give folks the breathing room they need to get back on their feet  and i won't let banks and lenders off the hook when it was their greed and irresponsibility that got us into this mess  we should not be bailing out wall street   we should be restoring opportunity on main street  and that's what we'll do when i'm president of the united states  these are the steps that we must take   right now   to start getting our economy back on track  but we also need a new set of priorities to grow our economy and create jobs over the long term  if i am president  i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new  green jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel efficient cars  jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from middle east dictators  i'll also put two million more americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads  schools  and bridges   because it is time to build an american infrastructure for the  st century  and if people ask how we're going to pay for this  you tell them that if we can spend   billion a month in iraq  we can spend some money to rebuild america  if i am president  i will finally fix the problems in our health care system that we've been talking about for too long  this issue is personal for me  my mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of   and i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed  fighting with her insurance company because they claimed that her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  if i am president  i will make sure those insurance companies can never do that again  my health care plan will make sure insurance companies can't discriminate against those who are sick and need care most  if you have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  if you don't have health insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  and we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families  businesses  and the entire economy  that's the change we need  and if i'm president  we'll give every child  everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker  anywhere in the world  i will not allow countries to out teach us today so they can out compete us tomorrow  it is time to provide every american with a world class education  that means investing in early childhood education  that means recruiting an army of new teachers  and paying them better  and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability  and it means making a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  my opponent's top economic advisor actually said that they have no plan to invest in college affordability because we can't have a giveaway to every special interest  well i don't think the young people of america are a special interest   they are the future of this country  that's why i'll make this deal with you  if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  no ifs  ands or buts  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together  we will move this country forward  now  make no mistake  the change we need won't come easy or without cost  we will all need to tighten our belts  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever  we are all in this together  at a defining moment like this  we don't have the luxury of relying on the same political games and the same political tactics that are used every election to divide us from one another and make us afraid of one another  with the challenges and crises we face right now  we cannot afford to divide this country by class or region  by who we are or what policies we support  there are no real or fake parts of this country  we are not separated by the pro america and anti america parts of this nation   we all love this country  no matter where we live or where we come from  there are patriots who supported this war in iraq and patriots who opposed it  patriots who believe in democratic policies and those who believe in republican policies  the men and women from florida and all across america who serve on our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents  but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag  they have not served a red america or a blue america   they have served the united states of america  we have always been at our best when we've had leadership that called us to look past our differences and come together as one nation  as one people  leadership that rallied this entire country to a common purpose   to a higher purpose  and i am running for president of the united states of america because that is the country we need to be right now  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed the same divisions and fear tactics and our own petty differences to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  this is one of those moments  i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics  i understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what's been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history  i ask you to believe   to believe in yourselves  in each other  and in the future we can build together  together  we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  or pay their bills at the end of the month  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves  we can do this  americans have done this before  some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  together  we cannot fail  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote  in florida  you can vote early right here  and right now  to find out how  just go to voteforchange com  and if you stand with me  i promise you   we will win florida  we will win this election  and then you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "good morning  we just finished a meeting with senator biden and members of my senior working group on national security  we had a wide ranging discussion on the challenges facing our nation  i've been pleased to draw on the support of these distinguished americans during this campaign  i was also honored to receive the support of colin powell on sunday  who is a friend and former colleague to many of those here with me  general powell is one of the finest soldiers and statesmen of our time  he has been a source of advice  and i look forward to drawing on his counsel   and the counsel of all of those standing with me today   if i am president  the next president will take office at a time of great uncertainty for america  we are in the midst of the greatest economic crisis since the great depression  and as challenging as our current economic crisis is  the next president will have to focus on national security challenges on many fronts  the terrorists who attacked us on   are still at large and plotting  and we must be vigilant in preventing future attacks  we are fighting two wars abroad  we are facing a range of  st century threats   from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to our dependence on foreign oil   which have grown more daunting because of the failed policies of the last eight years  to succeed  we need leadership that understands the connection between our economy and our strength in the world  we often hear about two debates   one on national security and one on the economy   but that is a false distinction  we can't afford another president who ignores the fundamentals of our economy while running up record deficits to fight a war without end in iraq  we must be strong at home to be strong abroad   that is the lesson of our history  our economy supports our military power  it increases our diplomatic leverage  and it is a foundation of america's leadership and in the world  through world war ii  american workers built an arsenal of democracy that helped our heroic troops face down fascism  through the cold war  the engine of the american economy helped power our triumph over communism  now  we must renew american competitiveness to support our security and global leadership  that means creating millions of jobs in a new american energy sector  so that we're not borrowing billions from china to buy oil from saudi arabia   for the sake of our economy and our security  we must end our dependence on foreign oil  keeping america ahead also calls for investments in american education  innovation and infrastructure  so that our kids can compete  our homeland is secure  and our country remains on the cutting edge  it also means leading an international response to the financial crisis  on september  th  i called for a globally coordinated effort with our partners in the g  to stabilize the credit markets  i'm happy that today  the white house announced a summit of the g  countries that provides an opportunity to advance the kind of cooperation that i called for last month  america must lead  and other nations must be part of the solution too  we must recognize that from global economic turmoil to global terrorism  the challenges we face demand american leadership of strong alliances  when america is isolated  we shoulder these burdens alone  and the security and prosperity of the american people is put at risk  yet for eight years  we have seen our alliances weakened and our standing in the world set back  we cannot afford four more years of policies that have failed to adjust to our new century  we're not going to defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries through an occupation of iraq  we're not going to deny the nuclear ambitions of iran by refusing to pursue direct diplomacy alongside our allies  we're not going to secure the american people and promote american values with empty bluster  it's time for a fundamental change  and that's why i'm running for president  this change must start with a responsible end to the war in iraq  we shouldn't keep spending   billion a month in iraq while the iraqis sit on a huge surplus  today  we discussed how to succeed in iraq by transitioning to iraqi responsibility  for the sake of our economy  our military  and the long term stability of iraq  it's time for the iraqis to step up  ending the war will help us deal with afghanistan  which we talked about at length this morning  in   i said we should focus on finishing the fight against osama bin laden  throughout this campaign  i have argued that we need more troops and more resources to win the war in afghanistan  and to confront the growing threat from al qaeda along the pakistani border  over seven years after   the situation in afghanistan is grave  this is the most violent year of the war  with the highest number of american casualties  the taliban is on the offensive  al qaeda has a sanctuary across the border in pakistan  and some experts believe that   percent of the afghan economy comes from the heroin trade  as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff recently said   the trends across the board are not going in the right direction  make no mistake  we are confronting an urgent crisis in afghanistan  and we have to act  it's time to heed the call from general mckiernan and others for more troops  that's why i'd send at least two or three additional combat brigades to afghanistan  we also need more training for afghan security forces  more non military assistance to help afghans develop alternatives to poppy farming  more safeguards to prevent corruption  and a new effort to crack down on cross border terrorism  only a comprehensive strategy that prioritizes afghanistan and the fight against al qaeda will succeed  and that's the change i'll bring to the white house  there is a clear choice in this election  on issue after issue  senator mccain has supported the key decisions and core approach of president bush  as president  he would continue the policies that have put our economy into crisis and endangered our national security  and as he's shown over the last few weeks  he would also continue the divisive politics that undercuts the bipartisan cooperation and national unity that is so badly needed in challenging times  we need to change course  at home  we must invest in the competitiveness of the american economy  abroad  we need a new direction that ends the war in iraq  focuses on the fight against al qaeda and the taliban  and restores strong alliances and tough american diplomacy  to keep our country safe and prosperous  we need leadership that brings the american people together  that is the lesson of our history  together  we cannot fail  together  we can rise to meet any challenge "], ["obama1", "hello  richmond  it's great to be back in virginia  and in just   days  we can finally

he said he couldn't  in good conscience  support a tax cut where the benefits went to the wealthy at the expense of  middle class americans who most need tax relief  well  he was right then  and i am right now  and let me be crystal clear  if you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year   which includes   of small business owners   you won't see your taxes increase one single dime  not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  that is my commitment to you  for the last eight years  we have tried it john mccain's way  we have tried it george bush's way  we've given more and more to those with the most and hoped that prosperity would trickle down to everyone else  and guess what  it didn't  so it's time try something new  it's time to grow this economy from the bottom up  it's time to invest in the middle class again  if i am president  i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new  green jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel efficient cars  jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from middle east dictators  i'll also put two million more americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads  schools  and bridges   because it is time to build an american infrastructure for the  st century  and if people ask how we're going to pay for this  you tell them that if we can spend   billion a month in iraq  we can spend some money to rebuild america  if i am president  i will finally fix the problems in our health care system that we've been talking about for too long  this issue is personal for me  my mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of   and i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed  fighting with her insurance company because they claimed that her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  if i am president  i will make sure those insurance companies can never do that again  my health care plan will make sure insurance companies can't discriminate against those who are sick and need care most  if you have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  if you don't have health insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  and we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families  businesses  and the entire economy  that's the change we need  and if i'm president  we'll give every child  everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker  anywhere in the world  i will not allow countries to out teach us today so they can out compete us tomorrow  it is time to provide every american with a world class education  that means investing in early childhood education  that means recruiting an army of new teachers  and paying them better  and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability  and it means making a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  my opponent's top economic advisor actually said that they have no plan to invest in college affordability because we can't have a giveaway to every special interest  well i don't think the young people of america are a special interest   they are the future of this country  that's why i'll make this deal with you  if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  no ifs  ands or buts  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together  we will move this country forward  now  make no mistake  the change we need won't come easy or without cost  we will all need to tighten our belts  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever  we are all in this together  at a defining moment like this  we don't have the luxury of relying on the same political games and the same political tactics that are used every election to divide us from one another and make us afraid of one another  with the challenges and crises we face right now  we cannot afford to divide this country by class or region  by who we are or what policies we support  there are no real or fake parts of this country  we are not separated by the pro america and anti america parts of this nation   we all love this country  no matter where we live or where we come from  there are patriots who supported this war in iraq and patriots who opposed it  patriots who believe in democratic policies and those who believe in republican policies  the men and women from virginia and all across america who serve on our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents  but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag  they have not served a red america or a blue america   they have served the united states of america  we have always been at our best when we've had leadership that called us to look past our differences and come together as one nation  as one people  leadership that rallied this entire country to a common purpose   to a higher purpose  and i am running for president of the united states of america because that is the country we need to be right now  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed the same divisions and fear tactics and our own petty differences to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  this is one of those moments  i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics  i understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what's been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history  i ask you to believe   to believe in yourselves  in each other  and in the future we can build together  together  we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  or pay their bills at the end of the month  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves  we can do this  americans have done this before  some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  together  we cannot fail  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote  and if you stand with me in thirteen days  i promise you   we will win virginia  we will win this election  and then you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "it is fitting that we meet today on the mall of the american legion  surrounded by monuments to our nation's heroes  because on this day    years ago  the marine barracks in beirut were bombed    americans laid down their lives for this country and for the peace they were there to protect  we revere their service  we honor their sacrifice  and we keep their families in our prayers  we will never forget them  indiana  in just   days  you'll have the chance to elect your next president  and you'll have the chance to bring the change we need to washington  that's the good news  but we're going to have to work  and struggle  and fight for every single one of those   days to move our country in a new direction  i am hopeful about the outcome  we were thrilled this weekend when a great american statesman  general colin powell  joined our cause  but we cannot let up  and we won't  because one thing we know is that change never comes without a fight  in the final days of campaigns  the say anything  do anything politics too often takes over  we've seen it before  and we're seeing it again today  the ugly phone calls  the misleading mail and tv ads  the careless  outrageous comments  all aimed at keeping us from working together  all aimed at stopping change  well  what we need now is not misleading charges and divisive attacks  what we need is honest leadership and real change  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  now  more than ever  this campaign has to be about the problems facing the american people   because this is a moment of great uncertainty for america  we're facing the worst economic crisis since the great depression  the dow plummeted again yesterday  threatening the job security  retirement security  and economic security of millions of ordinary americans  indiana lost   manufacturing jobs in september alone  and just today  we learned that more and more americans are filing for unemployment  home values are falling  foreclosures are rising  wages are shrinking  and the cost of health care and college tuition has never been higher  and that's what this election is all about   because john mccain and i have real differences about how to get us out of this economic mess  you see  senator mccain thinks the economic policies of george w  bush are just right for america  in the senate  he's voted with george bush   percent of the time  said earlier this year that we've made  great progress  over the last eight years  and while senator mccain says now that he's different from president bush  you sure couldn't tell by the policies he's proposing  just yesterday  senator mccain strongly defended the bush policy of lavishing tax cuts on corporations that ship american jobs overseas  he made the peculiar argument that the best way to stop companies from shipping jobs overseas is to give more tax cuts to companies that ship jobs overseas  more tax cuts for job outsourcers  that's what senator mccain proposed as his answer to outsourcing  he said that's   quote    simple fundamental economics  well  indiana  my opponent may call that  fundamental economics  but we know that's just another name for the wall street first  main street last economic philosophy we've had for the past eight years   and that's fundamentally wrong  if senator mccain wants to defend tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas  that's his choice  but i say  let's end tax cuts for companies that ship american jobs overseas  and give them to companies that create good jobs right here in indiana   in the united states of america  if he wants to defend free trade agreements designed to protect the profits of multinational corporations and a trade policy that lets countries like china tilt the playing field against our workers  that's up to him  but i say  we need a trade policy that protects the dreams of hardworking americans  if he wants to defend a tax code that's more than   pages long and filled with loopholes written in by corporate lobbyists like the ones running his campaign  he's got every right  he has every right to defend offshore tax havens that let companies avoid paying taxes here in america  but i say  it's time to close corporate loopholes  shut offshore tax havens  and restore balance and fairness to our tax code  by the way  did you know that there's a building in the cayman islands that supposedly houses   corporations  that's either the biggest building or the biggest tax scam on record  and i think we know which one it is  that's the system my opponent defends  that's the system he wants to preserve  well  indiana  we've tried it john mccain's way  we've tried it george bush's way  and we're here today to say enough is enough  we can't afford four more years of their  fundamental economics  that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  you see  i have a different notion of fundamental economics than my opponent  because where i come from  there's nothing more fundamental than a good paying job  there's nothing more fundamental than being able to pay your health care bills  put your kids through college  or retire with dignity and security  there's nothing more fundamental than the american dream   and that's the dream we can reclaim if you stand with me on november   i know we can do this  i know we can steer ourselves out of this crisis  because i believe in you  i believe in the american people  we are the united states of america  we are a nation that's faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we have risen to meet these challenges   not as democrats  not as republicans  but as americans  with resolve  with confidence  with that fundamental belief that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  it's written by us  that's who we are  and that's the country we need to be right now  but indiana  i know this  it will take a new direction  it will take new leadership in washington  it will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  it's time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put wall street before main street but ended up hurting both  we need policies that grow our economy from the bottom up  so that every american  everywhere  has the chance to get ahead  not just the person who owns the factory  but the men and women who work on its floor  because if we've learned anything from this economic crisis  it's that we're all connected  we're all in this together  and we will rise or fall as one nation   as one people  the rescue plan that passed the congress was a necessary first step to easing this credit crisis  but if we're going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up  we need an immediate rescue plan for the middle class   and that's what i will do as president of the united states  nine months ago  i called for a stimulus plan to provide immediate relief for states  along with tax rebates to get money directly to middle class families and a foreclosure prevention fund to help people keep their homes  senator mccain's advisors openly mocked the stimulus plan before congress   one referred to it  and i quote  as  borrowing money from the chinese and dropping it from helicopters  another dismissed it as  junk  just this week  after nine straight months of job losses  when our federal reserve chairman supports another stimulus to get our economy moving  senator mccain said he doesn't think we need to pass this stimulus immediately  well  the working families who've been hard hit by this economic crisis   folks who can't pay their mortgages or their medical bills or send their kids to college   they can't afford to go to the back of the line behind ceos and wall street banks  they need help right here  right now   and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  i've proposed a new american jobs tax credit for each new employee that companies hire here in the united states over the next two years  and i'll help make sure the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow are built not just in south korea or japan  but right here in indiana  few have been harder hit by our credit crisis than the workers who make our cars and the companies that supply their parts  now  when it came to rescuing wall street  washington didn't waste a minute  but now that auto workers are suffering  washington's put on the breaks  it turns out it could take a year for the auto industry to get the loan guarantees we passed a few weeks ago  well  the workers who are being laid off and the companies that are seeing their sales drop   they can't afford to wait a year  they need help right now  that's why i've called on washington to fast track those loan guarantees and provide more as needed   because that's how we'll secure our auto jobs and save our auto industry  i'll also help small businesses by eliminating capital gains taxes and giving them emergency loans to keep their doors open and hire workers  i'll put a three month moratorium on foreclosures so that we can give homeowners the breathing room they need to get back on their feet  and i will create a jobs and growth fund to help states and local governments save one million jobs and pay for health care and education without having to raise your taxes  these are the steps that we must take   right now   to start getting our economy back on track  but we also need a new set of priorities to grow our economy and create jobs over the long term  it starts with tax relief  there's been a lot of talk about taxes in this campaign  and the truth is  my opponent and i are both proposing tax cuts  the difference is  he wants to give a   tax cut to the average fortune   ceo  i want to put a middle class tax cut in the pockets of   of workers and their families  my opponent doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates for middle class families will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  it's true that i want to roll back the bush tax cuts on the wealthiest americans and go back to the rate they paid under bill clinton  john mccain calls that socialism  what he forgets is that just a few years ago  he himself said those bush tax cuts were irresponsible  he said he couldn't  in good conscience  support a tax cut where the benefits went to the wealthy at the expense of  middle class americans who most need tax relief  well  he was right

and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability  and it means investing in agricultural education  from seeing all those blue corduroy jackets in the crowd  i know there's a future farmers of america convention here in indianapolis  and i want you to know that if i'm elected president  i will fight for you   because america's farmers are america's future  and it's time we had a president who understood that  we need to make sure every american who has the drive and the will but not the money can go to college  my opponent's top economic advisor

["obama1", "hello  charleston  hello  west virginia  it is so good to be here  in the last debate  john mccain felt the need to declare that he's not president bush  and just yesterday  john mccain actually went so far as to try to compare barack obama to george w  bush  as my granddaughter says  hello  john mccain is now attacking the bush budget and fiscal policies  folks  this is as crazy as the sundance kid attacking butch cassidy  they were in this together  john mccain voted with george bush   percent of the time  until recently  he was bragging about it  he said these policies produced  great economic progress  look  i know halloween is coming  but john mccain as the candidate of change  that's one costume the american people aren't going to buy  so i know we're not running against president bush  but we are running against the very bush economic policies john mccain is promising to continue  john mccain and sarah palin call themselves mavericks  but to paraphrase your neighbor   senator bob casey from pennsylvania   you can't call yourself a maverick when all you've been is a sidekick  if you give barack obama and me the honor of serving as your president and vice president  here is what we will do  we will commit ourselves   night and day   to two overriding goals  first  restore the middle class  second  reclaim america's respect in the world  and the first step in reclaiming that leadership is to end this war in iraq  we will end this war in iraq   responsibly  now  even president bush is getting behind barack's plan to set a timeline for the withdrawal of our combat forces from iraq  only john mccain says no  he's wrong  and barack obama is right  to rebuild the middle class  we need to cut taxes for working people  we need an energy policy that frees us from the grip of foreign oil  with a firm commitment and a long term investment in alternative energy   wind  solar  biofuels  and clean coal  and let me say on that subject  john mccain doesn't believe clean coal is part of our energy future  don't take my word for it   take his  he said  in a perfect world  we would like to transition away from coal entirely  and now  he plans on giving the oil companies   who are recording the largest profits in the history of the united states another   billion in tax cuts  so make no mistake  the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain  that's why appalachia can't afford to  barack and i believe clean coal is part of our energy future  that's why we supported adding   million in funding for carbon capture and sequestration technology  instead of pouring our energy dollars into the sands of saudi arabia and the pockets of venezuela  we should be exporting home made technology   solving not only our own energy challenges  but the worlds  we need to make an investment in rebuilding america's infrastructure   including broadband and the infrastructure of the future  our plan that we estimate will create   jobs here in west virginia alone  this is about jobs  but in a sense  it's about even more than jobs  it's about dignity  it's about respect  it's about understanding what people are going through  when a job is lost or a house is foreclosed on  it's not just an economic loss  it's emotionally devastation  it's about having to make that long walk up that short flight of stairs that's something i've experienced  at the end of the day  if we want to strengthen the middle class and regain our respect in the world  we have to do one thing more  we have to unite this country  recently  in north carolina  governor palin said she was happy to be in a  pro america  part of our country  i was just in north carolina and it is a deeply patriotic place  but every state has sent its sons and daughters to serve and die for this country  west virginia is home to over   veterans  nearly   west virginians are currently deployed to iraq or afghanistan  and   of these fallen angels have given their lives  we all love this country  we are all patriots  that's why we have to end the scurrilous phone calls   which lie about barack obama and question his character  we're joined today by chaylee cole  chaylee is a student at fairmont state university who worked at a call center   where she was asked to make some of those attack calls  she said no  and she was fired  but i want to read part of what chaylee said when she was interviewed   democrat or republican  i wouldn't have done this  chaylee recognized that regardless of your personal politics  attacks like that don't hurt barack  they're an attempt to further divide the country  and distract you from the things that really matter  barack can take two eleven more days of these attacks  our country can't take four more years of bush mccain economic policies  what we need is the type of leadership being provided by your governor  joe manchin  we need the type of leadership provided by your senator  and the chairman of the senate intelligence committee  jay rockefeller  there is nobody both as knowledgeable and as straightforward  it's time we're all reminded that we are  one nation   under god  we are  indivisible  great leaders have always reminded us of this  and in west virginia  you have one of the greatest  senator robert c  byrd  senator byrd is a man who came up the hard way  he literally married a coal miner's daughter  he is the american dream  and he is a true friend  to learn about the ways of the senate from robert c  byrd is like getting trumpet lessons from the angel gabriel  great presidents have always turned dire circumstances into real opportunities by reminding americans of what we've overcome in the past  and appealing to our better angels  and i believe barack obama will be a great president  my father always told me  champ  when you get knocked down  get up  get up  i've never seen a time when more americans have been knocked down  it's time for us to get up  together  and bring the change we need to the country we love  america is ready  you are ready  i am ready  and barack obama is ready  it is our time  it is america's time  so let's get up  god bless

were four years ago  it's  are you better off than you were four weeks ago  so what we need right now is a real debate about how to fix our economy and help middle class families  but that's not what we're getting from the other side  a couple of weeks ago  my opponent's campaign said that  if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  so they said they'd be focusing on attacking me instead  and that's one campaign promise they've actually kept  senator mccain has been throwing everything he's got at us  hoping something will stick  he's even called me a socialist for suggesting that we focus on tax cuts  not for corporations and the wealthy  but for the middle class  the other day  he took it to a whole new level  he said that i was like george w  bush  you can't make this stuff up  folks  in what may be the strangest twist of all  senator mccain said that i would somehow continue the bush economic policies   and that he  john mccain  would change them  but then  just this morning  senator mccain said that he and president bush    share a common philosophy  that's right  colorado  i guess that was john mccain finally giving us a little straight talk  and owning up to the fact that he and george bush actually have a whole lot in common  well  we know what the bush mccain philosophy looks like  it's a philosophy that says we should give more and more to folks at the top and hope that it trickles down  it's a philosophy that gives tax breaks to wealthy ceos and to corporations that ship jobs overseas while hundreds of thousands of jobs are disappearing here at home  it's a philosophy that justifies spending   billion a month in iraq while the iraqi government sits on a huge surplus and our economy is in crisis  for eight years  we've seen the bush mccain philosophy put our country on the wrong track  and we cannot have another four years that look just like the last eight  it's time for change in washington  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  we know that the economic crisis that hit wall street has been hurting middle class families on main street for years  but during the primaries  senator mccain was saying that we've made  great progress economically  under george bush  and just last month he was still arguing that the  fundamentals of our economy are strong  that's not change  we know that we have to get spending under control in washington so that we're not mortgaging our children's future under a mountain of debt  but for all of senator mccain's tough talk on spending  he voted for four out of the five bush budgets that let things get totally out of control  that's not change  we know that it's time for new ideas and new leadership in the white house  but senator mccain voted with president bush   percent of the time over the last eight years  just the other day  george bush returned the favor and voted early for john mccain  well  colorado  you can vote early too  and you can finally put an end to the bush mccain philosophy  you can vote for change  you can vote for a new direction for our country  we know what's coming from the mccain campaign over the next nine days  because it's the same kind of politics that we've seen over the last eight years  it's a politics that is more about tearing your opponent down then lifting this country up  well i can take nine more days of john mccain's attacks  but the american people can't take four more years of the same failed policies and the same failed politics  we're not going to let george bush pass the torch to john mccain  it's time for change  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  i know these are difficult times  i know folks are worried  but i believe that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis because i believe in this country  because i believe in you  i believe in the american people  we are the united states of america  we are a nation that's faced down war and depression  great challenges and great threats  and at each and every moment  we have risen to meet these challenges   not as democrats  not as republicans  but as americans  with resolve  with confidence  with that fundamental belief that here in america  our destiny is not written for us  but by us  that's who we are  and that's the country we need to be right now  but colorado  i know this  it will take a new direction  it will take new leadership in washington  it's time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put wall street before main street but ended up hurting both  we need policies that grow our economy from the bottom up  so that every american  everywhere  has the chance to get ahead  not just the person who owns the factory  but the men and women who work on its floor  not just the ceo  but the secretary and the janitor  because if we've learned anything from this economic crisis  it's that we're all connected  we're all in this together  and we will rise or fall as one nation   as one people  the rescue plan that passed the congress was a necessary first step to easing this credit crisis  but if we're going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up  we need an immediate rescue plan for the middle class   and that's what i will do as president of the united states  i've proposed a new american jobs tax credit for each new employee that companies hire here in the united states over the next two years  i'll stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and invest in companies that create good jobs right here in colorado  i'll help small businesses get back on their feet by eliminating capital gains taxes and giving them emergency loans to keep their doors open and hire workers  and i will create a jobs and growth fund to help states and local governments save one million jobs and pay for health care and education without having to raise your taxes  i'll also act quickly to help people stay in their homes  i'll help responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages on affordable terms  and put in place a three month moratorium on foreclosures to give folks the breathing room they need to get back on their feet  and i won't let banks and lenders off the hook when it was their greed and irresponsibility that got us into this mess  we should not be bailing out wall street   we should be restoring opportunity on main street  these are the steps that we must take   right now   to start getting our economy back on track  but we also need a new set of priorities to grow our economy and create jobs over the long term  it starts with tax relief  there's been a lot of talk about taxes in this campaign  and the truth is  my opponent and i are both proposing tax cuts  the difference is  he wants to give a   tax cut to the average fortune   ceo  i want to put a middle class tax cut in the pockets of   of workers and their families  my opponent doesn't want you to know this  but under my plan  tax rates will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan  it's true that i want to roll back the bush tax cuts on the wealthiest americans and go back to the rate they paid under bill clinton  john mccain calls that socialism  what he forgets is that just a few years ago  he himself said those bush tax cuts were irresponsible  he said he couldn't  in good conscience  support a tax cut where the benefits went to the wealthy at the expense of  middle class americans who most need tax relief  well  he was right then  and i am right now  so let me be crystal clear  if you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year   which includes   of small business owners   you won't see your taxes increase one single dime  not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  that is my commitment to you  for the last eight years  we have tried it john mccain's way  we have tried it george bush's way  we've given more and more to those with the most and hoped that prosperity would trickle down to everyone else  and guess what  it didn't  so it's time to try something new  it's time to grow this economy by investing in the middle class again  if i am president  i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new  green jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel efficient cars  jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from middle east dictators  i'll also put two million more americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads  schools  and bridges   because it is time to build an american infrastructure for the  st century  and if people ask how we're going to pay for this  you tell them that if we can spend   billion a month in iraq  we can spend some money to rebuild america  if i am president  i will finally fix the problems in our health care system that we've been talking about for too long  this issue is personal for me  my mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of   and i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed  fighting with her insurance company because they claimed that her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  if i am president  i will make sure those insurance companies can never do that again  like george bush  john mccain wants to tax your health care benefits for the first time in history  and let insurance companies keep discriminating against people who need health care the most  it's the same  failed  insurance company first your family last health care policy   and we're going to change it  my health care plan will make sure insurance companies can't discriminate against those who are sick and need care most  if you have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  if you don't have health insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  and we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families  businesses  and the entire economy  that's the change we need  and if i'm president  we'll give every child  everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker  anywhere in the world  i will not allow countries to out teach us today so they can out compete us tomorrow  it is time to provide every american with a world class education  that means investing in early childhood education  that means recruiting an army of new teachers  and paying them better  and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability  and it means making a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  my opponent's top economic advisor actually said that they have no plan to invest in college affordability because we can't have a giveaway to every special interest  well i don't think the young people of america are a special interest   they are the future of this country  that's why i'll make this deal with you  if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  no ifs  ands or buts  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together  we will move this country forward  now  make no mistake  the change we need won't come easy or without cost  we will all need to tighten our belts  we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever  we are all in this together  at a defining moment like this  we don't have the luxury of relying on the same political games and the same political tactics that are used every election to divide us from one another and make us afraid of one another  with the challenges and crises we face right now  we cannot afford to divide this country by class or region  by who we are or what policies we support  there are no real or fake parts of this country  we are not separated by the pro america and anti america parts of this nation   we all love this country  no matter where we live or where we come from  there are patriots who supported this war in iraq and patriots who opposed it  patriots who believe in democratic policies and those who believe in republican policies  the men and women from colorado and all across america who serve on our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents  but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag  they have not served a red america or a blue america   they have served the united states of america  we have always been at our best when we've had leadership that called us to look past our differences and come together as one nation  as one people  leadership that rallied this entire country to a common purpose   to a higher purpose  and i am running for president of the united states of america because that is the country we need to be right now  this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century  and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test  will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose  when we allowed the same divisions and fear tactics and our own petty differences to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession  or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame  when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success  this is one of those moments  i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics  i understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what's been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history  i ask you to believe   to believe in yourselves  in each other  and in the future we can build together  together  we cannot fail  not now  not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save  not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes  not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor  or send their child to college  or pay their bills at the end of the month  not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves  we can do this  americans have done this before  some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but my child can  i may have to rent  but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own  i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate  i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america  now it falls to us  together  we cannot fail  and i need you to make it happen  if you want the next four years looking like the last eight  then i am not your candidate  but if you want real change   if you want an economy that rewards work  and that works for main street and wall street  if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs  if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete  then i ask you to knock on some doors  make some calls  talk to your neighbors  and give me your vote  in colorado  you can vote early right here  and right now  to find out how  just go to voteforchange com  and if you stand with me in nine days  i promise you   we will win colorado  we will win this election  and then you and i   together   will change this country and change this world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "one week  after decades of broken politics in washington  eight years of failed policies from george bush  and twenty one months of a campaign that has taken us from the rocky coast of maine to the sunshine of california  we are one week away from change in america  in one week  you can turn the page on policies that have put the greed and irresponsibility of wall street before the hard work and sacrifice of folks on main street  in one week  you can choose policies that invest in our middle class  create new jobs  and grow this economy from the bottom up so that everyone has a chance to succeed  from the ceo to the secretary and the janitor  from the factory owner to the men and women who work on its floor  in one week  you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election  that tries to pit region against region  city against town  republican against democrat  that asks us to fear at a time when we need hope  in one week  at this defining moment in history  you can give this country the change we need  we began this journey in the depths of winter nearly two years ago  on the steps of the old state capitol in springfield  illinois  back then  we didn't have much money or many endorsements  we weren't given much of a chance by the polls or the pundits  and we knew how steep our climb would be  but i also knew this  i knew that the size of our challenges had outgrown the smallness of our politics  i believed that democrats and republicans and americans of every political stripe were hungry for new ideas  new leadership  and a new kind of politics   one that favors common sense over ideology  one that focuses on those values and ideals we hold in common as americans  most of all  i believed in your ability to make change happen  i knew that the american people were a decent  generous people who are willing to work hard and sacrifice for future generations  and i was convinced that when we come together  our voices are more powerful than the most entrenched lobbyists  or the most vicious political attacks  or the full force of a status quo in washington that wants to keep things just the way they are  twenty one months later  my faith in the american people has been vindicated  that's how we've come so far and so close   because of you  that's how we'll change this country   with your help  and that's why we can't afford to slow down  sit back  or let up for one day  one minute  or one second in this last week  not now  not when so much is at stake  we are in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the great depression    workers have lost their jobs this year  businesses and families can't get credit  home values are falling  pensions are disappearing  wages are lower than they've been in a decade  at a time when the cost of health care and college have never been higher  it's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage  or fill up your gas tank  or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month  at a moment like this  the last thing we can afford is four more years of the tired  old theory that says we should give more to billionaires and big corporations and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  the last thing we can afford is four more years where no one in washington is watching anyone on wall street because politicians and lobbyists killed common sense regulations  those are the theories that got us into this mess  they haven't worked  and it's time for change  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  now  senator mccain has served this country honorably  and he can point to a few moments over the past eight years where he has broken from george bush   on torture  for example  he deserves credit for that  but when it comes to the economy   when it comes to the central issue of this election   the plain truth is that john mccain has stood with this president every step of the way  voting for the bush tax cuts for the wealthy that he once opposed  voting for the bush budgets that spent us into debt  calling for less regulation twenty one times just this year  those are the facts  and now  after twenty one months and three debates  senator mccain still has not been able to tell the american people a single major thing he'd do differently from george bush when it comes to the economy  senator mccain says that we can't spend the next four years waiting for our luck to change  but you understand that the biggest gamble we can take is embracing the same old bush mccain policies that have failed us for the last eight years  it's not change when john mccain wants to give a   tax cut to the average fortune   ceo  it's not change when he wants to give   billion to the biggest corporations or   billion to the oil companies or   billion to the same wall street banks that got us into this mess  it's not change when he comes up with a tax plan that doesn't give a penny of relief to more than   million middle class americans  that's not change  look   we've tried it john mccain's way  we've tried it george bush's way  deep down  senator mccain knows that  which is why his campaign said that  if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  that's why he's spending these last weeks calling me every name in the book  because that's how you play the game in washington  if you can't beat your opponent's ideas  you distort those ideas and maybe make some up  if you don't have a record to run on  then you paint your opponent as someone people should run away from  you make a big election about small things  ohio  we are here to say  not this time  not this year  not when so much is at stake  senator mccain might be worried about losing an election  but i'm worried about americans who are losing their homes  and their jobs  and their life savings  i can take one more week of john mccain's attacks  but this country can't take four more years of the same old politics and the same failed policies  it's time for something new  the question in this election is not  are you better off than you were four years ago  we know the answer to that  the real question is   will this country be better off four years from now  i know these are difficult times for america  but i also know that we have faced difficult times before  the american story has never been about things coming easy   it's been about rising to the moment when the moment was hard  it's about seeing the highest mountaintop from the deepest of valleys  it's about rejecting fear and division for unity of purpose  that's how we've overcome war and depression  that's how we've won great struggles for civil rights and women's rights and worker's rights  and that's how we'll emerge from this crisis stronger and more prosperous than we were before   as one nation  as one people  remember  we still have the most talented  most productive workers of any country on earth  we're still home to innovation and technology  colleges and universities that are the envy of the world  some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities  so there's no reason we can't make this century another american century  we just need a new direction  we need a new politics  now  i don't believe that government can or should try to solve all our problems  i know you don't either  but i do believe that government should do that which we cannot do for ourselves   protect us from harm and provide a decent education for our children  invest in new roads and new science and technology  it should reward drive and innovation and growth in the free market  but it should also make sure businesses live up to their responsibility to create american jobs  and look out for american workers  and play by the rules of the road  it should ensure a shot at success not only for those with money and power and influence  but for every single american who's willing to work  that's how we create not just more millionaires  but more middle class families  that's how we make sure businesses have customers that can afford their products and services  that's how we've always grown the american economy   from the bottom up  john mccain calls this socialism  i call it opportunity  and there is nothing more american than that  understand  if we want get through this crisis  we need to get beyond the old ideological debates and divides between left and right  we don't need bigger government or smaller government  we need a better government   a more competent government   a government that upholds the values we hold in common as americans  we don't have to choose between allowing our financial system to collapse and spending billions of taxpayer dollars to bail out wall street banks  as president  i will ensure that the financial rescue plan helps stop foreclosures and protects your money instead of enriching ceos  and i will put in place the common sense regulations i've been calling for throughout this campaign so that wall street can never cause a crisis like this again  that's the change we need  the choice in this election isn't between tax cuts and no tax cuts  it's about whether you believe we should only reward wealth  or whether we should also reward the work and workers who create it  i will give a tax break to   of americans who work every day and get taxes taken out of their paychecks every week  i'll eliminate income taxes for seniors making under   and give homeowners and working parents more of a break  and i'll help pay for this by asking the folks who are making more than   a year to go back to the tax rate they were paying in the  s  no matter what senator mccain may claim  here are the facts   if you make under   you will not see your taxes increase by a single dime   not your income taxes  not your payroll taxes  not your capital gains taxes  nothing  because the last thing we should do in this economy is raise taxes on the middle class  when it comes to jobs  the choice in this election is not between putting up a wall around america or allowing every job to disappear overseas  the truth is  we won't be able to bring back every job that we've lost  but that doesn't mean we should follow john mccain's plan to keep giving tax breaks to corporations that send american jobs overseas  i will end those breaks as president  and i will give american businesses a   tax credit for every job they create right here in the united states of america  i'll eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start up companies that are the engine of job creation in this country  we'll create two million new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads  and bridges  and schools  and by laying broadband lines to reach every corner of the country  and i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new energy jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and a new electricity grid  jobs building the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow  not in japan or south korea but here in the united states of america  jobs that will help us eliminate the oil we import from the middle east in ten years and help save the planet in the bargain  that's how america can lead again  when it comes to health care  we don't have to choose between a government run health care system and the unaffordable one we have now  if you already have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  if you don't have health insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families  businesses  and the entire economy  and as someone who watched his own mother spend the final months of her life arguing with insurance companies because they claimed her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care most  when it comes to giving every child a world class education so they can compete in this global economy for the jobs of the  st century  the choice is not between more money and more reform   because our schools need both  as president  i will invest in early childhood education  recruit an army of new teachers  pay them more  and give them more support  but i will also demand higher standards and more accountability from our teachers and our schools  and i will make a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together  we will move this country forward  and when it comes to keeping this country safe  we don't have to choose between retreating from the world and fighting a war without end in iraq  it's time to stop spending   billion a month in iraq while the iraqi government sits on a huge surplus  as president  i will end this war by asking the iraqi government to step up  and finally finish the fight against bin laden and the al qaeda terrorists who attacked us on   i will never hesitate to defend this nation  but i will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home  i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the  st century  and i will restore our moral standing  so that america is once again that last  best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom  who long for lives of peace  and who yearn for a better future  i won't stand here and pretend that any of this will be easy   especially now  the cost of this economic crisis  and the cost of the war in iraq  means that washington will have to tighten its belt and put off spending on things we can afford to do without  on this  there is no other choice  as president  i will go through the federal budget  line by line  ending programs that we don't need and making the ones we do need work better and cost less  but as i've said from the day we began this journey all those months ago  the change we need isn't just about new programs and policies  it's about a new politics   a politics that calls on our better angels instead of encouraging our worst instincts  one that reminds us of the obligations we have to ourselves and one another  part of the reason this economic crisis occurred is because we have been living through an era of profound irresponsibility  on wall street  easy money and an ethic of  what's good for me is good enough  blinded greedy executives to the danger in the decisions they were making  on main street  lenders tricked people into buying homes they couldn't afford  some folks knew they couldn't afford those houses and bought them anyway  in washington  politicians spent money they didn't have and allowed lobbyists to set the agenda  they scored political points instead of solving our problems  and even after the greatest attack on american soil since pearl harbor  all we were asked to do by our president was to go out and shop  that is why what we have lost in these last eight years cannot be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits alone  what has also been lost is the idea that in this american story  each of us has a role to play  each of us has a responsibility to work hard and look after ourselves and our families  and each of us has a responsibility to our fellow citizens  that's what's been lost these last eight years   our sense of common purpose  of higher purpose  and that's what we need to restore right now  yes  government must lead the way on energy independence  but each of us must do our part to make our homes and our businesses more efficient  yes  we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair  but all of us must do our part as parents to turn off the television and read to our children and take responsibility for providing the love and guidance they need  yes  we can argue and debate our positions passionately  but at this defining moment  all of us must summon the strength and grace to bridge our differences and unite in common effort   black  white  latino  asian  native american  democrat and republican  young and old  rich and poor  gay and straight  disabled or not  in this election  we cannot afford the same political games and tactics that are being used to pit us against one another and make us afraid of one another  the stakes are too high to divide us by class and region and background  by who we are or what we believe  because despite what our opponents may claim  there are no real or fake parts of this country  there is no city or town that is more pro america than anywhere else   we are one nation  all of us proud  all of us patriots  there are patriots who supported this war in iraq and patriots who opposed it  patriots who believe in democratic policies and those who believe in republican policies  the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents  but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag  they have not served a red america or a blue america   they have served the united states of america  it won't be easy  ohio  it won't be quick  but you and i know that it is time to come together and change this country  some of you may be cynical and fed up with politics  a lot of you may be disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what has been asked of americans throughout our history  i ask you to believe   not just in my ability to bring about change  but in yours  i know this change is possible  because i have seen it over the last twenty one months  because in this campaign  i have had the privilege to witness what is best in america  i've seen it in lines of voters that stretched around schools and churches  in the young people who cast their ballot for the first time  and those not so young folks who got involved again after a very long time  i've seen it in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see their friends lose their jobs  in the neighbors who take a stranger in when the floodwaters rise  in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb  i've seen it in the faces of the men and women i've met at countless rallies and town halls across the country  men and women who speak of their struggles but also of their hopes and dreams  i still remember the email that a woman named robyn sent me after i met her in ft  lauderdale  sometime after our event  her son nearly went into cardiac arrest  and was diagnosed with a heart condition that could only be treated with a procedure that cost tens of thousands of dollars  her insurance company refused to pay  and their family just didn't have that kind of money  in her email  robyn wrote   i ask only this of you   on the days where you feel so tired you can't think of uttering another word to the people  think of us  when those who oppose you have you down  reach deep and fight back harder  ohio  that's what hope is   that thing inside us that insists  despite all evidence to the contrary  that something better is waiting around the bend  that insists there are better days ahead  if we're willing to work for it  if we're willing to shed our fears and our doubts  if we're willing to reach deep down inside ourselves when we're tired and come back fighting harder  hope  that's what kept some of our parents and grandparents going when times were tough  what led them to say   maybe i can't go to college  but if i save a little bit each week my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but if i work really hard my child can open one of her own  it's what led immigrants from distant lands to come to these shores against great odds and carve a new life for their families in america  what led those who couldn't vote to march and organize and stand for freedom  that led them to cry out   it may look dark tonight  but if i hold on to hope  tomorrow will be brighter  that's what this election is about  that is the choice we face right now  don't believe for a second this election is over  don't think for a minute that power concedes  we have to work like our future depends on it in this last week  because it does  in one week  we can choose an economy that rewards work and creates new jobs and fuels prosperity from the bottom up  in one week  we can choose to invest in health care for our families  and education for our kids  and renewable energy for our future  in one week  we can choose hope over fear  unity over division  the promise of change over the power of the status quo  in one week  we can come together as one nation  and one people  and once more choose our better history  that's what's at stake  that's what we're fighting for  and if in this last week  you will knock on some doors for me  and make some calls for me  and talk to your neighbors  and convince your friends  if you will stand with me  and fight with me  and give me your vote  then i promise you this   we will not just win ohio  we will not just win this election  but together  we will change this country and we will change the world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "one week  after decades of broken politics in washington  eight years of failed policies from george bush  and twenty one months of a campaign that has taken us from the rocky coast of maine to the sunshine of california  we are one week away from change in america  in one week  you can turn the page on policies that have put the greed and irresponsibility of wall street before the hard work and sacrifice of folks on main street  in one week  you can choose policies that invest in our middle class  create new jobs  and grow this economy from the bottom up so that everyone has a chance to succeed  from the ceo to the secretary and the janitor  from the factory owner to the men and women who work on its floor  in one week  you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election  that tries to pit region against region  city against town  republican against democrat  that asks us to fear at a time when we need hope  in one week  at this defining moment in history  you can give this country the change we need  we began this journey in the depths of winter nearly two years ago  on the steps of the old state capitol in springfield  illinois  back then  we didn't have much money or many endorsements  we weren't given much of a chance by the polls or the pundits  and we knew how steep our climb would be  but i also knew this  i knew that the size of our challenges had outgrown the smallness of our politics  i believed that democrats and republicans and americans of every political stripe were hungry for new ideas  new leadership  and a new kind of politics   one that favors common sense over ideology  one that focuses on those values and ideals we hold in common as americans  most of all  i believed in your ability to make change happen  i knew that the american people were a decent  generous people who are willing to work hard and sacrifice for future generations  and i was convinced that when we come together  our voices are more powerful than the most entrenched lobbyists  or the most vicious political attacks  or the full force of a status quo in washington that wants to keep things just the way they are  twenty one months later  my faith in the american people has been vindicated  that's how we've come so far and so close   because of you  that's how we'll change this country   with your help  and that's why we can't afford to slow down  sit back  or let up for one day  one minute  or one second in this last week  not now  not when so much is at stake  we are in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the great depression    workers have lost their jobs this year  businesses and families can't get credit  home values are falling  pensions are disappearing  wages are lower than they've been in a decade  at a time when the cost of health care and college have never been higher  it's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage  or fill up your gas tank  or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month  and yet  just yesterday  we learned that despite this crisis  wall street bank executives are set to walk away with billions more in bonuses at the end of this year  well  they might call that a bonus on wall street  but here in pennsylvania  we call it an outrage   and they shouldn't be allowed to get away with it  we can't afford four more years of the tired  old theory that says we should give more to billionaires and big corporations and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  that's the failed theory that got us into this mess  it hasn't worked  and it's time for change  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  now  in the closing days of this campaign  my opponent is trying to distance himself from the president he has faithfully supported   of the time  he's supported four of the five bush budgets that have taken us from the surpluses of the clinton years to the largest deficits in history  john mccain has ridden shotgun as george bush has driven our economy toward a cliff  and now he wants to take the wheel and step on the gas  and when it comes to the issue of taxes  saying that john mccain is running for a third bush term isn't being fair to george w  bush  he's proposing   billion in new tax cuts for the wealthiest americans and big corporations  that's something not even george bush proposed  not even george bush proposed another   tax cut to the average fortune   ceo  not even george bush proposed a plan that would leave out   million middle class families  that's not change  change is a middle class tax cut for   of workers and their families  change is eliminating income taxes for seniors making under   and giving homeowners and working parents more of a break  change is eliminating capital gains taxes for the small businesses that are the engine of job creation in this country  that's what i want to do  that's what change is  the fact is  there's only one candidate with a plan that could eventually raise taxes on millions of middle class families  and it isn't me  it's my opponent  who'd make you pay taxes on your health care benefits for the first time ever  now  it's true that i want to roll back the bush tax cuts on the wealthiest americans and go back to the rate they paid under bill clinton  but make no mistake  if you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year   which includes   of small business owners   you won't see your taxes increase one single dime  not your payroll taxes  not your income taxes  not your capital gains taxes   nothing  because the last thing we should do in this economy is raise taxes on the middle class  in the end  the choice in this election isn't between tax cuts and no tax cuts  it's about whether you believe we should only reward wealth  or whether we should also reward the work and workers who create it  it's about whether you believe in an america where opportunity and success is open to anyone who's willing to work for it  and that's the america we will build together when i'm president of the united states  we've tried it john mccain's way  we've tried it george bush's way  deep down  senator mccain knows that  which is why his campaign said that  if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  that's why he's spending these last weeks calling me every name in the book  because that's how you play the game in washington  if you can't beat your opponent's ideas  you distort those ideas and maybe make some up  if you don't have a record to run on  then you paint your opponent as someone people should run away from  you make a big election about small things  pennsylvania  we are here to say  not this time  not this year  not when so much is at stake  senator mccain might be worried about losing an election  but i'm worried about americans who are losing their homes  and their jobs  and their life savings  i can take one more week of john mccain's attacks  but this country can't take four more years of the same old politics and the same failed policies  it's time for something new  the question in this election is not  are you better off than you were four years ago  we know the answer to that  the real question is   will this country be better off four years from now  i know these are difficult times for america  but i also know that we have faced difficult times before  the american story has never been about things coming easy   it's been about rising to the moment when the moment was hard  it's about seeing the highest mountaintop from the deepest of valleys  it's about rejecting fear and division for unity of purpose  that's how we've overcome war and depression  that's how we've won great struggles for civil rights and women's rights and worker's rights  and that's how we'll emerge from this crisis stronger and more prosperous than we were before   as one nation  as one people  remember  we still have the most talented  most productive workers of any country on earth  we're still home to innovation and technology  colleges and universities that are the envy of the world  some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities  so there's no reason we can't make this century another american century  we just need a new direction  we need a new politics  now  i don't believe that government can or should try to solve all our problems  i know you don't either  but i do believe that government should do that which we cannot do for ourselves   protect us from harm and provide a decent education for our children  invest in new roads and new science and technology  it should reward drive and innovation and growth in the free market  but it should also make sure businesses live up to their responsibility to create american jobs  and look out for american workers  and play by the rules of the road  it should ensure a shot at success not only for those with money and power and influence  but for every single american who's willing to work  that's how we create not just more millionaires  but more middle class families  that's how we make sure businesses have customers that can afford their products and services  that's how we've always grown the american economy   from the bottom up  john mccain calls this socialism  i call it opportunity  and there is nothing more american than that  understand  if we want get through this crisis  we need to get beyond the old ideological debates and divides between left and right  we don't need bigger government or smaller government  we need a better government   a more competent government   a government that upholds the values we hold in common as americans  we don't have to choose between allowing our financial system to collapse and spending billions of taxpayer dollars to bail out wall street banks  as president  i will ensure that the financial rescue plan helps stop foreclosures and protects your money instead of enriching ceos  and i will put in place the common sense regulations i've been calling for throughout this campaign so that wall street can never cause a crisis like this again  that's the change we need  when it comes to jobs  the choice in this election is not between putting up a wall around america or allowing every job to disappear overseas  the truth is  we won't be able to bring back every job that we've lost  but that doesn't mean we should follow john mccain's plan to keep giving tax breaks to corporations that send american jobs overseas  i will end those breaks as president  and i will give american businesses a   tax credit for every job they create right here in the united states of america  we'll create two million new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads  and bridges  and schools  and by laying broadband lines to reach every corner of the country  and i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new energy jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and a new electricity grid  jobs building the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow  not in japan or south korea but here in the united states of america  jobs that will help us eliminate the oil we import from the middle east in ten years and help save the planet in the bargain  that's how america can lead again  when it comes to health care  we don't have to choose between a government run health care system and the unaffordable one we have now  if you already have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  if you don't have health insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families  businesses  and the entire economy  and as someone who watched his own mother spend the final months of her life arguing with insurance companies because they claimed her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care most  when it comes to giving every child a world class education so they can compete in this global economy for the jobs of the  st century  the choice is not between more money and more reform   because our schools need both  as president  i will invest in early childhood education  recruit an army of new teachers  pay them more  and give them more support  but i will also demand higher standards and more accountability from our teachers and our schools  and i will make a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together  we will move this country forward  i won't stand here and pretend that any of this will be easy   especially now  the cost of this economic crisis  and the cost of the war in iraq  means that washington will have to tighten its belt and put off spending on things we can afford to do without  on this  there is no other choice  as president  i will go through the federal budget  line by line  ending programs that we don't need and making the ones we do need work better and cost less  but as i've said from the day we began this journey all those months ago  the change we need isn't just about new programs and policies  it's about a new politics   a politics that calls on our better angels instead of encouraging our worst instincts  one that reminds us of the obligations we have to ourselves and one another  part of the reason this economic crisis occurred is because we have been living through an era of profound irresponsibility  on wall street  easy money and an ethic of  what's good for me is good enough  blinded greedy executives to the danger in the decisions they were making  on main street  lenders tricked people into buying homes they couldn't afford  some folks knew they couldn't afford those houses and bought them anyway  in washington  politicians spent money they didn't have and allowed lobbyists to set the agenda  they scored political points instead of solving our problems  and even after the greatest attack on american soil since pearl harbor  all we were asked to do by our president was to go out and shop  that is why what we have lost in these last eight years cannot be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits alone  what has also been lost is the idea that in this american story  each of us has a role to play  each of us has a responsibility to work hard and look after ourselves and our families  and each of us has a responsibility to our fellow citizens  that's what's been lost these last eight years   our sense of common purpose  of higher purpose  and that's what we need to restore right now  yes  government must lead the way on energy independence  but each of us must do our part to make our homes and our businesses more efficient  yes  we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair  but all of us must do our part as parents to turn off the television and read to our children and take responsibility for providing the love and guidance they need  yes  we can argue and debate our positions passionately  but at this defining moment  all of us must summon the strength and grace to bridge our differences and unite in common effort   black  white  latino  asian  native american  democrat and republican  young and old  rich and poor  gay and straight  disabled or not  in this election  we cannot afford the same political games and tactics that are being used to pit us against one another and make us afraid of one another  the stakes are too high to divide us by class and region and background  by who we are or what we believe  because despite what our opponents may claim  there are no real or fake parts of this country  there is no city or town that is more pro america than anywhere else   we are one nation  all of us proud  all of us patriots  there are patriots who supported this war in iraq and patriots who opposed it  patriots who believe in democratic policies and those who believe in republican policies  the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents  but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag  they have not served a red america or a blue america   they have served the united states of america  it won't be easy  pennsylvania  it won't be quick  but you and i know that it is time to come together and change this country  some of you may be cynical and fed up with politics  a lot of you may be disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what has been asked of americans throughout our history  i ask you to believe   not just in my ability to bring about change  but in yours  i know this change is possible  because i have seen it over the last twenty one months  because in this campaign  i have had the privilege to witness what is best in america  i've seen it in lines of voters that stretched around schools and churches  in the young people who cast their ballot for the first time  and those not so young folks who got involved again after a very long time  i've seen it in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see their friends lose their jobs  in the neighbors who take a stranger in when the floodwaters rise  in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb  i've seen it in the faces of the men and women i've met at countless rallies and town halls across the country  men and women who speak of their struggles but also of their hopes and dreams  i still remember the email that a woman named robyn sent me after i met her in ft  lauderdale  sometime after our event  her son nearly went into cardiac arrest  and was diagnosed with a heart condition that could only be treated with a procedure that cost tens of thousands of dollars  her insurance company refused to pay  and their family just didn't have that kind of money  in her email  robyn wrote   i ask only this of you   on the days where you feel so tired you can't think of uttering another word to the people  think of us  when those who oppose you have you down  reach deep and fight back harder  pennsylvania  that's what hope is   that thing inside us that insists  despite all evidence to the contrary  that something better is waiting around the bend  that insists there are better days ahead  if we're willing to work for it  if we're willing to shed our fears and our doubts  if we're willing to reach deep down inside ourselves when we're tired and come back fighting harder  hope  that's what kept some of our parents and grandparents going when times were tough  what led them to say   maybe i can't go to college  but if i save a little bit each week my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but if i work really hard my child can open one of her own  it's what led immigrants from distant lands to come to these shores against great odds and carve a new life for their families in america  what led those who couldn't vote to march and organize and stand for freedom  that led them to cry out   it may look dark tonight  but if i hold on to hope  tomorrow will be brighter  that's what this election is about  that is the choice we face right now  don't believe for a second this election is over  don't think for a minute that power concedes  we have to work like our future depends on it in this last week

on some doors for me  and make some calls for me  and talk to your neighbors  and convince your friends  if you will stand with me  and fight with me  and give me your vote  then i promise you this   we will not just win pennsylvania  we will not just win this election  but together  we will change this country and we will change the world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "north carolina  i've got two words for you  six days  and you don't even have to wait six days to vote   you can vote early right now  but this is important  when you do vote  you have to vote in two steps   one for president  and one for the rest of the ticket  if you vote for a straight ticket  you have not voted in the presidential election  you need to vote for president separately

great depression    workers have lost their jobs this year  businesses and families can't get credit  home values are falling  pensions are disappearing  wages are lower than they've been in a decade  at a time when the cost of health care and college have never been higher  it's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage  or fill up your gas tank  or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month  at a moment like this  the last thing we can afford is four more years of the tired  old theory that says we should give more to billionaires and big corporations and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  the last thing we can afford is four more years where no one in washington is watching anyone on wall street because politicians and lobbyists killed common sense regulations  those are the theories that got us into this mess  they haven't worked  and it's time for change  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  now  senator mccain has served this country honorably  and he can point to a few moments over the past eight years where he has broken from george bush   on torture  for example  he deserves credit for that  but when it comes to the economy   when it comes to the central issue of this election   the plain truth is that john mccain has stood with this president every step of the way  voting for the bush tax cuts for the wealthy that he once opposed  voting for the bush budgets that spent us into debt  calling for less regulation twenty one times just this year  those are the facts  senator mccain says that we can't spend the next four years waiting for our luck to change  but you understand that the biggest gamble we can take is embracing the same old policies that have failed us for the last eight years  we've tried it john mccain's way  we've tried it george bush's way  it hasn't worked  deep down  senator mccain knows that  which is why his campaign said that  if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  that's why he's spending these last few days calling me every name in the book  i'm sorry to see my opponent sink so low  lately  he's called me a socialist for wanting to roll back the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans so we can finally give tax relief to the middle class  by the end of the week  he'll be accusing me of being a secret communist because i shared my toys in kindergarten  that's his choice  that's the kind of campaign he chose to run  but you have a choice too  the fundamental question in this election is not  are you better off than you were four years ago  we know the answer to that  the real question is   will this country be better off four years from now  for eight years  we've seen washington take care of the extremely well off and well connected  and now my opponent is making the same old arguments to justify the same old policies that have been a complete failure for the middle class  he wants to give more to billionaires  more to corporations that ship jobs overseas  more to the same people whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this crisis  we're here because we know they shouldn't get away with it any more  we don't need another president who fights for washington lobbyists and wall street  we need a president who stands up for hardworking americans on main street  and that's what i'll be  it's time to think very hard about what four years of john mccain's policies will mean for the middle class  if senator mccain is elected    million americans will not get a tax cut  you won't see a cent  but the average fortune   ceo will get   and big oil will get   billion  if senator mccain is elected  your health care benefits will get taxed for the first time in history  and at least twenty million americans risk losing their employer health insurance  if senator mccain is elected  we'll have another president who wants to privatize part of your social security  if senator mccain is elected  he won't make your college tuition affordable  his campaign says they have no college affordability plan because they consider the young people of america just another special interest  whether you are nancy the nurse  tina the teacher  or carl the construction worker   if my opponent is elected  you will be worse off four years from now than you are today  so let's cut through the negative ads and the phony attacks   under john mccain  the middle class will watch wealth get favored over work  jobs get shipped overseas  and the cost of health care and college go through the roof  north carolina  we know that just won't do  not this time  it's time for change  it's time to do what's right for you  for our economy  and for our country i know that my opponent is worried about losing an election  but i'm worried about americans who are losing their homes  and their jobs  and their life savings  i'm worried about the middle class  and i won't just fight for your vote in the final days of election   i will fight for you every single day that i'm in the white house  that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  so i can take six more days of john mccain's attacks  but this country can't take four more years of the same old politics and the same failed policies  it's time for something new  i know these are difficult times for america  but i also know that we have faced difficult times before  the american story has never been about things coming easy   it's been about rising to the moment when the moment was hard  it's about seeing the highest mountaintop from the deepest of valleys  it's about rejecting fear and division for unity of purpose  that's how we've overcome war and depression  that's how we've won great struggles for civil rights and women's rights and worker's rights  and that's how we'll emerge from this crisis stronger and more prosperous than we were before   as one nation  as one people  remember  we still have the most talented  most productive workers of any country on earth  we're still home to innovation and technology  colleges and universities that are the envy of the world  some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities  so there's no reason we can't make this century another american century  we just need a new direction  we need a new politics  now  i don't believe

get taxes taken out of their paychecks every week  i'll eliminate income taxes for seniors making under   and give homeowners and working parents more of a break  and i'll help pay for this by asking the folks who are making more than   a year to go back to the tax rate they were paying in the  s  no matter what senator mccain may claim  here are the facts   if you make under   you will not see your taxes increase by a single dime   not your income taxes  not your payroll taxes  not your capital gains taxes  nothing  because the last thing we should do in this economy is raise taxes on the middle class  when it comes to jobs  the choice in this election is not between putting up a wall around america or allowing every job to disappear overseas  the truth is  we won't be able to bring back every job that we've lost  but that doesn't mean we should follow john mccain's plan to keep giving tax breaks to corporations that send american jobs overseas  i will end those breaks as president  and i will give american businesses a   tax credit for every job they create right here in the united states of america  i'll eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start up companies that are the engine of job creation in this country  we'll create two million new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads  and bridges  and schools  and by laying broadband lines to reach every corner of the country  and i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new energy jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and a new electricity grid  jobs building the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow  not in japan or south korea but here in the united states of america  jobs that will help us eliminate the oil we import from the middle east in ten years and help save the planet in the bargain  that's how america can lead again  when it comes to health care  we don't have to choose between a government run health care system and the unaffordable one we have now  if you already have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  if you don't have health insurance  you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families  businesses  and the entire economy  and as someone who watched his own mother spend the final months of her life arguing with insurance companies because they claimed her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care most  when it comes to giving every child a world class education so they can compete in this global economy for the jobs of the  st century  the choice is not between more money and more reform   because our schools need both  as president  i will invest in early childhood education  recruit an army of new teachers  pay them more  and give them more support  but i will also demand higher standards and more accountability from our teachers and our schools  and i will make a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  you invest in america  america will invest in you  and together  we will move this country forward  and when it comes to keeping this country safe  we don't have to choose between retreating from the world and fighting a war without end in iraq  it's time to stop spending   billion a month in iraq while the iraqi government sits on a huge surplus  as president  i will end this war by asking the iraqi government to step up  and finally finish the fight against bin laden and the al qaeda terrorists who attacked us on   i will never hesitate to defend this nation  but i will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home  i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the  st century  and i will restore our moral standing  so that america is once again that last  best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom  who long for lives of peace  and who yearn for a better future  i won't stand here and pretend that any of this will be easy   especially now  the cost of this economic crisis  and the cost of the war in iraq  means that washington will have to tighten its belt and put off spending on things we can afford to do without  on this  there is no other choice  as president  i will go through the federal budget  line by line  ending programs that we don't need and making the ones we do need work better and cost less  but as i've said from the day we began this journey all those months ago  the change we need isn't just about new programs and policies  it's about a new politics   a politics that calls on our better angels instead of encouraging our worst instincts  one that reminds us of the obligations we have to ourselves and one another  part of the reason this economic crisis occurred is because we have been living through an era of profound irresponsibility  on wall street  easy money and an ethic of  what's good for me is good enough  blinded greedy executives to the danger in the decisions they were making  on main street  lenders tricked people into buying homes they couldn't afford  some folks knew they couldn't afford those houses and bought them anyway  in washington  politicians spent money they didn't have and allowed lobbyists to set the agenda  they scored political points instead of solving our problems  and even after the greatest attack on american soil since pearl harbor  all we were asked to do by our president was to go out and shop  that is why what we have lost in these last eight years cannot be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits alone  what has also been lost is the idea that in this american story  each of us has a role to play  each of us has a responsibility to work hard and look after ourselves and our families  and each of us has a responsibility to our fellow citizens  that's what's been lost these last eight years   our sense of common purpose  of higher purpose  and that's what we need to restore right now  yes  government must lead the way on energy independence  but each of us must do our part to make our homes and our businesses more efficient  yes  we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair  but all of us must do our part as parents to turn off the television and read to our children and take responsibility for providing the love and guidance they need  yes  we can argue and debate our positions passionately  but at this defining moment  all of us must summon the strength and grace to bridge our differences and unite in common effort   black  white  latino  asian  native american  democrat and republican  young and old  rich and poor  gay and straight  disabled or not  in this election  we cannot afford the same political games and tactics that are being used to pit us against one another and make us afraid of one another  the stakes are too high to divide us by class and region and background  by who we are or what we believe  because despite what our opponents may claim  there are no real or fake parts of this country  there is no city or town that is more pro america than anywhere else   we are one nation  all of us proud  all of us patriots  there are patriots who supported this war in iraq and patriots who opposed it  patriots who believe in democratic policies and those who believe in republican policies  the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents  but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag  they have not served a red america or a blue america   they have served the united states of america  it won't be easy  north carolina  it won't be quick  but you and i know that it is time to come together and change this country  some of you may be cynical and fed up with politics  a lot of you may be disappointed and even angry with your leaders  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what has been asked of americans throughout our history  i ask you to believe   not just in my ability to bring about change  but in yours  i know this change is possible  because i have seen it over the last twenty one months  because in this campaign  i have had the privilege to witness what is best in america  i've seen it in lines of voters that stretched around schools and churches  in the young people who cast their ballot for the first time  and those not so young folks who got involved again after a very long time  i've seen it in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see their friends lose their jobs  in the neighbors who take a stranger in when the floodwaters rise  in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb  i've seen it in the faces of the men and women i've met at countless rallies and town halls across the country  men and women who speak of their struggles but also of their hopes and dreams  i still remember the email that a woman named robyn sent me after i met her in ft  lauderdale  sometime after our event  her son nearly went into cardiac arrest  and was diagnosed with a heart condition that could only be treated with a procedure that cost tens of thousands of dollars  her insurance company refused to pay  and their family just didn't have that kind of money  in her email  robyn wrote   i ask only this of you   on the days where you feel so tired you can't think of uttering another word to the people  think of us  when those who oppose you have you down  reach deep and fight back harder  north carolina  that's what hope is   that thing inside us that insists  despite all evidence to the contrary  that something better is waiting around the bend  that insists there are better days ahead  if we're willing to work for it  if we're willing to shed our fears and our doubts  if we're willing to reach deep down inside ourselves when we're tired and come back fighting harder  hope  that's what kept some of our parents and grandparents going when times were tough  what led them to say   maybe i can't go to college  but if i save a little bit each week my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but if i work really hard my child can open one of her own  it's what led immigrants from distant lands to come to these shores against great odds and carve a new life for their families in america  what led those who couldn't vote to march and organize and stand for freedom  that led them to cry out   it may look dark tonight  but if i hold on to hope  tomorrow will be brighter  that's what this election is about  that is the choice we face right now  don't believe for a second this election is over  don't think for a minute that power concedes  we have to work like our future depends on it in this last week  because it does  in six days  we can choose an economy that rewards work and creates new jobs and fuels prosperity from the bottom up  in six days  we can choose to invest in health care for our families  and education for our kids  and renewable energy for our future  in six days  we can choose hope over fear  unity over division  the promise of change over the power of the status quo  in six days  we can come together as one nation  and one people  and once more choose our better history  that's what's at stake  that's what we're fighting for  and if in this last week  you will knock on some doors for me  and make some calls for me  and talk to your neighbors  and convince your friends  if you will stand with me  and fight with me  and give me your vote  then i promise you this   we will not just win north carolina  we will not just win this election  but together  we will change this country and we will change the world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "florida  i have just two words for you  five days  after decades of broken politics in washington  eight years of failed policies from george bush  and twenty one months of a campaign that has taken us from the rocky coast of maine to the sunshine of california  we are five days away from change in america  in five days  you can turn the page on policies that have put the greed and irresponsibility of wall street before the hard work and sacrifice of folks on main street  in five days  you can choose policies that invest in our middle class  create new jobs  and grow this economy so that everyone has a chance to succeed  from the ceo to the secretary and the janitor  from the factory owner to the men and women who work on its floor  in five days  you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election  that tries to pit region against region  city against town  republican against democrat  that asks us to fear at a time when we need hope  in five days  at this defining moment in history  you can give this country the change we need  we began this journey in the depths of winter nearly two years ago  on the steps of the old state capitol in springfield  illinois  back then  we didn't have much money or many endorsements  we weren't given much of a chance by the polls or the pundits  and we knew how steep our climb would be  but i also knew this  i knew that the size of our challenges had outgrown the smallness of our politics  i believed that democrats and republicans and americans of every political stripe were hungry for new ideas  new leadership  and a new kind of politics   one that favors common sense over ideology  one that focuses on those values and ideals we hold in common as americans  most of all  i knew the american people were a decent  generous people willing to work hard and sacrifice for future generations  i was convinced that when we come together  our voices are more powerful than the most entrenched lobbyists  or the most vicious political attacks  or the full force of a status quo in washington that wants to keep things just the way they are  twenty one months later  my faith in the american people has been vindicated  that's how we've come so far and so close   because of you  that's how we'll change this country   with your help  and that's why we can't afford to slow down  sit back  or let up for one day  one minute  or one second in this last week  not now  not when so much is at stake  we are in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the great depression    workers have lost their jobs this year  businesses and families can't get credit  home values are falling  pensions are disappearing  it's gotten harder and harder to make the mortgage  or fill up your gas tank  or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month  and just today  we learned that the gdp  or gross domestic product   a key indicator economists use to measure the health of our economy   has actually fallen for the first time this year  that means we're producing less and selling less   so our economy is actually shrinking  and we saw the largest decline in consumer spending in   years as wages failed to keep up with the rising cost of living  and folks have been watching every penny and tightening their belts  now  this didn't happen by accident  our falling gdp is a direct result of eight years of the trickle down  wall street first main street last policies that have driven our economy into a ditch  and the central question in this election is this  what will our next president do to take us in a different direction  well  florida  if you want to know where senator mccain will drive this economy  just look in the rearview mirror  because when it comes to our economic policies  john mccain has stood with president bush every step of the way  voting for the bush tax cuts for the wealthy that he once opposed  voting for the bush budgets that sent us into debt  calling for less regulation twenty one times just this year  in fact  after twenty one months and three debates  senator mccain still has not been able to tell the american people a single major thing he'd do differently from george bush when it comes to the economy  and you've got to ask yourself  after nine straight months of job losses and the largest drop in home values on record  with wages lower than they've been in a decade  why would we keep on driving down this dead end street  folks who can't pay their medical bills  or send their kids to college  or save for retirement can't afford to take a back seat to ceos and wall street banks for four more years  at a moment like this  the last thing we can afford is four more years of the tired  old theory that says we should give more to billionaires and big corporations and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  the last thing we can afford is four more years where no one in washington is watching anyone on wall street because politicians and lobbyists killed common sense regulations  those are the theories that got us into this mess  they haven't worked  and it's time for change  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  look  the biggest gamble we can take is embracing the same old bush mccain policies that have failed us for the last eight years  it's not change when john mccain wants to give a   tax cut to the average fortune   ceo  it's not change when he wants to give   billion to the biggest corporations or   billion to the oil companies or   billion to the same wall street banks that got us into this mess  it's not change when he comes up with a tax plan that doesn't give a penny of relief to more than   million middle class americans  that's not change  the average working family is   dollars poorer now than when george bush took office  when bill clinton was president  the average wages and incomes went up   dollars  so i've got an economic plan that is similar to bill clinton's and senator mccain's got an economic plan similar to george bush's  look and see what works and what doesn't  we've tried it john mccain's way  we've tried it george bush's way  deep down  senator mccain knows that  which is why his campaign said that  if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  that's why he's spending these last weeks calling me every name in the book  because that's how you play the game in washington  if you don't have a record to run on  then you paint your opponent as someone people should run away from  you make a big election about small things  florida  we are here to say  not this time  not this year  not when so much is at stake  senator mccain might be worried about losing an election  but i'm worried about americans who are losing their homes  and their jobs  and their life savings  i can take one more week of john mccain's attacks  but this country can't take four more years of the same old politics and the same failed policies  it's time for something new  the question in this election is not  are you better off than you were four years ago  we know the answer to that  the real question is   will this country be better off four years from now  i know these are difficult times for america  but i also know that we have faced difficult times before  the american story has never been about things coming easy   it's been about rising to the moment when the moment was hard  it's about rejecting fear and division for unity of purpose  that's how we've overcome war and depression  that's how we've won great struggles for civil rights and women's rights and workers' rights  and that's how we'll emerge from this crisis stronger and more prosperous than we were before   as one nation  as one people  we just need a new direction  we need a new politics  understand  if we want get through this crisis  we need to get beyond the old ideological debates and divides between left and right  we don't need bigger government or smaller government  we need a better government   a more competent government   a government that upholds the values we hold in common as americans  we don't have to choose between letting our financial system run wild  and stifling growth and innovation  as president  i will ensure that the financial rescue plan congress passed helps stop foreclosures and protects your money instead of enriching ceos  and i will put in place the common sense regulations i've been calling for throughout this campaign so that wall street can never cause a crisis like this again  that's the change we need  the choice in this election isn't between tax cuts and no tax cuts  it's about whether you believe we should only reward wealth  or whether we should also reward the work and workers who create it  i will give a tax break to   of americans who work every day and get taxes taken out of their paychecks every week  i'll eliminate income taxes for seniors making under   and give homeowners and working parents more of a break  and i'll help pay for this by asking the folks who are making more than   a year to go back to the tax rate they were paying in the  s  no matter what senator mccain may claim  here are the facts   if you make under   you will not see your taxes increase by a single dime   not your income taxes  not your payroll taxes  not your capital gains taxes  nothing  because the last thing we should do in this economy is raise taxes on the middle class  when it comes to jobs  the choice in this election is not between putting up a wall around america or allowing every job to disappear overseas  the truth is  we won't be able to bring back every job that we've lost  but that doesn't mean we should follow john mccain's plan to keep giving tax breaks to corporations that send american jobs overseas and promoting unfair trade agreements  i will end those breaks as president  and i will give american businesses a   tax credit for every job they create right here in the united states of america  i'll eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start up companies that are the engine of job creation in this country  we'll create two million new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads  and bridges  and schools  and by laying broadband lines to reach every corner of the country  and i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new energy jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and a new electricity grid  jobs that will help us eliminate the oil we import from the middle east in ten years and help save the planet in the bargain  that's how america can lead again  when it comes to health care  we don't have to choose between a government run health care system and the unaffordable one we have now  if you already have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  if

a month in iraq while the iraqi government sits on a huge surplus  as president  i will end this war by asking the iraqi government to step up  and i will finally finish the fight against bin laden and the al qaeda terrorists who attacked us on   i will never hesitate to defend this nation  from day one of this campaign  i have made clear that we will increase our ground troops and our investments in the finest fighting force the world has ever known  watching our soldiers  sailors  airmen and marines fight in iraq and afghanistan has only deepened my commitment to invest in  st century technologies so that our men and women have the best training and equipment when they deploy into combat and the care and benefits they have earned when they come home  i won't stand here and pretend that any of this will be easy   especially now  the cost of this economic crisis  and the cost of the war in iraq  means that washington will have to tighten its belt and put off spending on

workers have lost their jobs so far this year  and that means a lot of young people are concerned about their job prospects when they graduate   cheering and applause  obama  businesses and families can't get credit  home values are plummeting  pensions are disappearing  it's gotten harder to get   to make a mortgage  or fill up your gas tank  or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month  just today  we learned that the gdp  the gross domestic product  a key indicator economists use to measure the health of our economy  has actually fallen for the first time this year  and that means we're producing less and we're selling less  so  our economy is actually shrinking  now  this didn't happen by accident  our falling gdp is a direct result of eight years of failed economic policies  eight years of trickle down  wall street first  main street last policies that have driven our economy into a ditch  and the central question in this election is  what will our next president do to take us in a different direction  now  if you want to know where senator mccain will drive this economy   audience booing  obama  you don't need to boo  you just need to vote   cheering and applause  obama  if   cheering and applause  obama  if you want to know where senator mccain wants to drive the economy  just look in the rear view mirror   laughter  obama    because  when it comes to our economic policies  john mccain  he's ridden shotgun next to george bush every step of the way    percent   cheering and applause  obama    voting for the bush tax cuts for the wealthy that he said he opposed  voting for the bush budgets that sent us into debt  calling for less regulation   times just this year  and  so    months and three debates later  john mccain still cannot describe  can't tell the american people a single major thing he would do differently from george bush when it comes to the economy  i mean  think about it  you guys have been seeing these ads  right   cheering and applause  obama  do you have any idea what john mccain stands for  unidentified male  no  unidentified female  no  unidentified male  no  obama  because he spends all his time talking about me  you've got to ask yourself   you've got to ask yourself  after nine straight months of job losses  the largest drop in home values on record  wages lower than they've been in a decade  why would we think about continuing to drive down this dead end street with john mccain  folks who can't pay their medical bills  or send their kids to college or you not being able to afford college  or thinking about that   or   or   worth of debt that you might have to carry  people who can't save for retirement  you know  ordinary americans  we can't take a back seat to ceos and wall street banks for four more years  at a moment like this  we don't need the same old  tired  stale theories that say we should give more and more money to billionaires and millionaires and big corporations and hope that prosperity trickles down on everybody else  we can't afford four more years where no one in washington is watching anyone on wall street  so lobbyists just kill common sense regulations  those are the economic theories that got us into this mess  that have not worked  it's time for a new driver behind the wheel  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  unidentified male  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can  unidentified male  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can  unidentified male  yes  we can  yes  we can  yes  we can  obama  the biggest gamble we can take is to embrace the same old bush mccain policies that have failed us for the last eight years  it's not change when john mccain wants to give a   tax cut to the average fortune   ceo  it's not change when he wants to give   billion to the biggest corporation or   billion to the oil companies when today  exxon mobil announced that it had made the greatest profits of any corporation in the history of the world    billion in one quarter  that's all your money  you are   you are paying it at the gas station  that's not change when john mccain comes up with a tax plan that doesn't give a penny of relief to more than   million middle class americans  now  i understand what's at stake here  and especially you young people because you're going to be going into the workforce  you have to understand what's happening  the average working family is   poorer now than when george bush took office  when bill clinton was president  the average   when bill clinton was president  the average wage went up  the average income went up   now  i've got an economic plan similar to bill clinton's  john mccain has got an economic plan similar to george bush's  so we've had a  month   a  year experiment  eight years of bush mccain economics  eight years of the kind of clinton obama economics that we are looking to reinstitute  we know what works  we tried it john mccain's way  we tried it george bush's way  it did not work  and deep down senator mccain knows that  which is why his campaign said the other day that if we keep on talking about the economy  we're going to lose  which is why i keep on talking about the economy  that's why john mccain's spending these last weeks calling me every name in the book  they can't even decide what to call me  they can't decide on a single angle  so  you know   but you know what  that's how the game is played in washington  you make a big election about small things  but  missouri  we're here to say not this time  not this year  not when there's so much at stake  john mccain might be worried about losing an election  i'm worried about people losing their homes and losing their jobs and losing their life savings and losing your scholarships and losing your student loans  i can take five more days of john mccain's attacks  this country can't take four more years of john mccain's economic theories  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  it's time for something new  the question in this election isn't are you better off than you were four years ago  we know the answer to that  the real question is will this country be better off four years from now  now  i know these are difficult times  i know these are difficult times  and i know a lot of people are anxious about the future  but remember  we faced difficult times before  the american story has never been about things coming easy  it's been about rising at the moment when times are tough  it's about rejecting fear and division for unity and purpose  it's about digging deep down and finding in ourselves what's best in america  that's how we overcame war and depression  that's how we won the great struggles for civil rights and women's rights and workers' rights  that's how we'll emerge from this crisis stronger and more prosperous than we were before  as one nation and one people  we just need a new direction  we just need a new politics  we need a new driver behind the wheel  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  now  understand  if we get through this crisis  we're also going to need to get behind the old ideological debates that divide left and right  that's one of the great things about young people  you're not burdened with some of these old arguments  they've been going on for years  you know  we don't need  for example  bigger government or smaller government  we need better government  smarter government  a more competent government  a government that reflects our values  we don't have to choose between letting our financial system and the marketplace run wild or stifling growth and innovation  as president  i will insure that the financial rescue package  for example  that congress passed works to help stop foreclosures  protects taxpayer money  doesn't enrich ceos  stabilizes the financial system  and i will put in place common sense regulations that i've been calling for throughout this campaign so wall street can never cause this crisis again  but we will still have a free market system that rewards innovation and rewards growth  that's the kind of change that we need  we don't need these false choices that we've been hearing about out of washington for     years  the choice in this election isn't between tax cuts and no tax cuts  it's whether   whether you believe we should only reward wealth or whether we should also reward work and the workers who create  see  i'm planning to give a tax break to   percent of americans who work everyday and get their taxes taken out of their paycheck every week  and i'm going to eliminate taxes for seniors who are making less than   and give homeowners and working parents more of a break  now  john mccain has attacked me  because to help pay for tax cuts for   percent of americans  i'm going to be asking folks who make more than a quarter million dollars a year to go back to the tax rate they were paying in the  s under bill clinton  now  let me just   let me just see a show of hands  how many people make less than a quarter million dollars a year  all right  you're not raising your hand  so i'm going to look for a campaign contribution from you  now  it looks like  i think  a lot of people here fall in that category  now  no matter what senator mccain may claim  here are the facts  if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year  you will not see your taxes increase by a single dime  not your income tax or payroll tax  not your capital gains tax  nothing  because the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class  and the first thing we should do is give the teacher the break or the nurse the break or the cop the break or the firefighter the break  that's who needs a break  john mccain calls that socialism  redistribution  he says  i guess he's looking to check if  when i was in kindergarten  i shared my toys or i shared my peanut butter and jelly sandwich  i don't know when we decided to make a virtue out of selfishness  i think there's nothing wrong with us saying we want every single american to have opportunity  that's what this country is all about  that's what will grow this economy  that's what i'm going to fight for as president of the united states of america  when it comes to jobs  the choice in this election is not between putting a wall up around america or standing by and doing nothing  the truth is  we won't be able to bring back every job that's been lost  but that doesn't mean we should do what john mccain wants to do  keep giving tax cuts to companies that ship jobs overseas  promote unfair trade agreements  we're going to change our trade relationship  when i'm president  to make sure that american workers are getting a decent deal  and i'm going to make sure that we end those tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas  and we're going to give tax breaks to companies that invest right here in the united states of america  we're going to eliminate capital gains tax for small businesses  small business and start ups  they're the engines of job creation in this country  and we'll create two million new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges and schools  laying broadband lines to reach every corner of missouri and every corner of the country  and i will invest   billion in renewable sources of energy to create five million new energy jobs over the next decade  jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines  a new electricity grid  jobs building the new fuel  efficient cars of the future right here in the united states of america  jobs that will help us eliminate the oil we import from the middle east in ten years and help save the planet in the bargain  that's how america can lead again  when it comes to health care  we don't have to choose between a government run health care system and the unaffordable one we have now  if you already have health insurance  the only thing that's going to change is we're going to help lower your premiums  now  if you are a young person up to the age of   we're going to make sure you can stay on your parents' health insurance  and once you   once you're older than that and you don't have health insurance on the job  you'll be able to buy in and get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  and as someone who watched his own mother spend the final months of her life arguing with insurance companies because they claimed her cancer was a pre existing condition  they didn't want to pay for her treatment  i know what it's like to see a loved one suffer  not just because they're sick but because of a broken health care system  it is wrong  and when i am president  i'm going to stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most  that is a promise that i make to the american people  when it comes to giving every child a world class education  the choice is not between more money and more reform  because our schools need both  so as president i want to invest in early childhood education to close the achievement gap  and i want to recruit and army of new teachers  give them higher salaries  give them more support  expect higher standards and more accountability  and i will make a deal with every one of the young people who are here today and all across america  if you are willing to participate in national service  if you are willing to serve in the military or the peace corps  work in veterans' home or a homeless shelter  whatever moves you  whatever kind of service you want to provide your community and your country  we are going to make sure you can afford your tuition  no ifs  ands or buts  and finally  when it comes to keeping this country safe  we don't have to choose between retreating from the world and fighting a war without end in iraq  it is time to stop spending   billion a month in iraq while the iraqi government sits on a huge surplus  as president  i will end this war  i will end this war by asking the iraqi government to step up  and then we can finally finish the fight against bin laden and the al qaeda terrorists who killed   americans on   i'll never hesitate to defend this nation  we'll make sure that our ground troops have the equipment that they need  that they remain the finest fighting force in the world  you know  when you watch our soldiers and sailors  airmen and marines fight in iraq and afghanistan  you realize they have done everything that's been asked of them  and that's why they need a commander in chief who will make sure that we use our military wisely  that our men and women have the best training and the best equipment and that they receive the best care and benefits that they have earned when they come home  no more homeless veterans  no more begging for disability payments  we will treat them with honor and respect  now  i won't stand here and pretend that any of this is going to be easy  especially now  george bush has dug a deep hole  he is trying to hand off that shovel to john mccain  the cost of this crisis  the cost of the war in iraq means that washington is going to have to tighten its belt  it's going to have to put off spending on some things we don't need  you know  one of the things that we've seen over the last eight years is this incredible spending binge  this irresponsibility that you guys are expected to pay back  mounting national debt  mounting deficits  and you don't have anything to show for it  so as president  i'm going to go through the federal budget line by line  ending programs we don't need  making the ones we do need work better and cost less  we've got to make sure that we are not charging a credit card to the next generation  borrowing from china just pay off our dependence on foreign oil  but as i've said from the day we began this journey  the change we need isn't just about new programs and new policies  it's also about a new attitude  a new politics  a politics that calls on our better angels instead of encouraging our worst instincts  yes  that's what we've lost these last eight years  it can't be measured just by lost wages or bigger trade deficits or number of foreclosures  what's been lost is the idea that  in this american story  each of us has a role to play  i look at all these young people here tonight  each of you have a responsibility to work hard and look after yourselves and eventually your families  but each of you also have a responsibility to your country  a duty to your fellow citizens  that's what we need to restore now  our sense of common purpose  our sense of higher purpose  you know  government has to lead the way on energy independence  but all of you can make a difference in how you live your lives to make sure we're more energy efficient  you know  we can put more money in the schools  but government can't be the parent who turns off the tv set and makes a child do their homework at night  that's a parent's job  we can argue and debate our positions passionately  but all of us have to summon a restored strength and grace  a civility to bridge our differences and unite in common effort black  white  asian  native american  democrat  republican  young  old  rich  poor  gay  straight  disabled  not disabled  all of us coming together  all of us around common effort  at this time  at this moment  we can't afford the same old political games  the same nasty ads  the same underhanded tactics that are used to pit us against one another  make us afraid of one another  despite what our opponents claim  there's are no real or fake parts in america  there's no city or town that's more pro america than anywhere else  we're one nation  all of us are proud  all of us are patriots  the men and women who serve on our battlefields  they may be democrats and republicans and independents  but they've all fought together and bled together  some dying together under the same proud flag  they haven't served a red america or a blue america  they've served the united states of america  now  this change   this change i'm talking about won't be easy  and it won't be quick  but you and i know it's time  i look at this younger generation  you'd especially know that it's time  you can remake the world  you imagine not what is but what might be  and for those a little older  like me  some of you may be cynical and fed up with politics  and you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what's been asked of americans throughout our history  i ask you to believe  not just in my ability to bring about change but in yours  i know this change is possible  i've seen it over the last   months  in this campaign  i've had the privilege to witness what is best in america  i've seen it in the lines of voters that stretch around schools and churches and the young people who cast their ballot for the very first time  the young  the not so young  the young at heart who got involved again after a very long time  i've seen it in the workers who would rather cut back their hours in the factory than see their friends lose their jobs  in the neighbors who take a stranger in when the floodwaters rise  in the soldiers who reenlist after losing a limb  i've seen it in the faces of men and women in all the rallies and town halls across the country that we've had  men and women who speak of their struggles but also their hopes and their dreams  now  i was in ft  lauderdale  we had a rally  and afterwards  a woman named robin sent me an e mail  because apparently after our event  her son nearly went into cardiac arrest  a young man  high school student  he was diagnosed with a heart condition that could only be treated with a procedure that cost tens of thousands of dollars  her   robin's insurance company refused to pay  the family just didn't have that kind of money  and in her e mail robin wrote to me  she said   senator  i ask only this of you  on the days where you feel so tired  you can't think of uttering another word to the people  think of us  when those who oppose you have you down  reach deep and fight back hard  missouri  that's what hope is  that thing inside us that insists that  despite all evidence to the contrary  there are better days ahead  if we're willing to work for it  if we're willing to shed our fears  if we're willing to reach deep down inside ourselves when we're tired  when we're discouraged and come back fighting hard  that's what kept some of our parents and grandparents going through tough times  that what led some of them to say   maybe i can't go to college  but if i save a little bit each week  each month  maybe my child can go to college  maybe i can't have a business of my own  but if i save and work hard  maybe my child or grandchild can have a business of their own  it's what led immigrants from distance lands to settle on these shores  what led those who couldn't vote to march and organize and stand for freedom  to let out a cry that says it may look dark tonight  but if i hold onto hope  tomorrow will be brighter  people who couldn't vote but imagined maybe their son or daughter might run for the presidency of the united states of america  that's what this election is about  that's the choice we face right now  don't believe for a second this election is over  don't think for a minute power can seize anything  it's going to get nasty  i'm sure  in the next four days  they will throw everything at us  like they've been doing  and we are going to have to work like our future depends on it in this last week  you know what  because it does  and all those young people who are here tonight  i've got to have every single one of you voting  and you've got to grab five more  all of you have got to vote  all of you have to dig down deep  all of you have to help make history  i know this  missouri  you know this  the time for change has come  and if  in this last week  you will knock on some doors for me and make some calls for me  go to barackobama com and find out where to vote  if you'll stand with me and fight by my side and cast your ballot for me  i promise you this  we will not just win missouri  we will win this general election and together  we will change this country and we will change the world  thank you  god bless you  and god bless the united states of america "], ["obama1", "iowa  i have just two words for you  four days  after decades of broken politics in washington  eight years of failed policies from george bush  and twenty one months of a campaign that has taken us from the rocky coast of maine to the sunshine of california  we are four days away from change in america  in four days  you can turn the page on policies that have put the greed and irresponsibility of wall street before the hard work and sacrifice of folks on main street  in four days  you can choose policies that invest in our middle class  create new jobs  and grow this economy so that everyone has a chance to succeed  from the ceo to the secretary and the janitor  from the factory owner to the men and women who work on its floor  in four days  you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election  that tries to pit region against region  city against town  republican against democrat  that asks us to fear at a time when we need hope  in four days  at this defining moment in history  you can give this country the change we need  we began this journey in the depths of winter nearly two years ago  on the steps of the old state capitol in springfield  illinois  back then  we didn't have much money or many endorsements  we weren't given much of a chance by the polls or the pundits  and we knew how steep our climb would be  but i also knew this  i knew that the size of our challenges had outgrown the smallness of our politics  i believed that democrats and republicans and americans of every political stripe were hungry for new ideas  new leadership  and a new kind of politics   one that favors common sense over ideology  one that focuses on those values and ideals we hold in common as americans  most of all  i knew the american people were a decent  generous people willing to work hard and sacrifice for future generations  i was convinced that when we come together  our voices are more powerful than the most entrenched lobbyists  or the most vicious political attacks  or the full force of a status quo in washington that wants to keep things just the way they are  twenty one months later  my faith in the american people has been vindicated  that's how we've come so far and so close   because of you  that's how we'll change this country   with your help  and that's why we can't afford to slow down  sit back  or let up for one day  one minute  or one second in this last week  not now  not when so much is at stake  we are in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the great depression    workers have lost their jobs this year  businesses and families can't get credit  home values are falling  pensions are disappearing  it's gotten harder and harder to make the mortgage  or fill up your gas tank  or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month  at a moment like this  the last thing we can afford is four more years of the tired  old theory that says we should give more to billionaires and big corporations and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  the last thing we can afford is four more years where no one in washington is watching anyone on wall street because politicians and lobbyists killed common sense regulations  those are the theories that got us into this mess  they haven't worked  and it's time for change  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  now  senator mccain has served this country honorably  and he can point to a few moments over the past eight years where he has broken from george bush  just this morning  the mccain campaign put out an ad that showed me praising him and senator lieberman for their work on global warming   as if there's something wrong with acknowledging when an opponent has said or done something that makes sense  i think we need more of that in washington  i don't disagree with senator mccain on everything  and i respect his occasional displays of independence  but when it comes to the economy   when it comes to the central issue of this election   the plain truth is that john mccain has stood with this president every step of the way  voting for the bush tax cuts for the wealthy that he once opposed  voting for the bush budgets that spent us into debt  calling for less regulation twenty one times just this year  those are the facts  and now  after twenty one months and three debates  senator mccain still has not been able to tell the american people a single major thing he'd do differently from george bush when it comes to the economy  senator mccain says that we can't spend the next four years waiting for our luck to change  but you understand that the biggest gamble we can take is embracing the same old bush mccain policies that have failed us for the last eight years  it's not change when john mccain wants to give a   tax cut to the average fortune   ceo  it's not change when he wants to give   billion to the biggest corporations or   billion to the oil companies or   billion to the same wall street banks that got us into this mess  it's not change when he comes up with a tax plan that doesn't give a penny of relief to more than   million middle class americans  we've tried it john mccain's way  we've tried it george bush's way  deep down  senator mccain knows that  which is why his campaign said that  if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  that's why he's spending these last weeks calling me every name in the book  because that's how you play the game in washington  when you can't win on the strength of your ideas  you make a big election about small things  so i expect we're going to see a lot more of that over the next four days  more of the slash and burn  say anything  do anything politics that's calculated to divide and distract  to tear us apart instead of bringing us together  a couple of elections ago  there was a presidential candidate who decried this kind of politics and condemned these kinds of tactics  and i admired him for it   we all did  he said   i will not take the low road to the highest office in this land  those words were spoken eight years ago by my opponent  john mccain  but the high road didn't lead him to the white house then  so this time  he decided to take a different route  now  i know campaigns are tough  because we've got real differences about big issues and we care passionately about this country's future  and make no mistake  we will respond swiftly and forcefully with the truth to whatever falsehoods they throw our way  the stakes are too high to do anything less  but iowa  at this moment  in this election  we have the chance to do more than just beat back this kind of politics   we have the chance to end it once and for all  we have the chance to prove that the one thing more powerful than the politics of anything goes   the one thing the cynics didn't count on   is the will of the american people  we have the chance to prove that we are more than a collection of red states and blue states   we are the united states of america  that's how we'll steer ourselves out of this crisis   with a new politics for a new time  that's how we'll build the future we know is possible   as one people  as one nation  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  iowa  i know these are difficult times  but i also know that we have faced difficult times before  the american story has never been about things coming easy   it's been about rising to the moment when the moment was hard  it's about rejecting fear and division for unity of purpose  that's how we've overcome war and depression  that's how we've won great struggles for civil rights and women's rights and workers' rights  and that's how we'll write the next great chapter in the american story  we just need a new direction  understand  if we want get through this crisis  we need to get beyond the old ideological debates and divides between left and right  we don't need bigger government or smaller government  we need a better government   a more competent government   a government that upholds the values we hold in common as americans  we don't have to choose between letting our financial system run wild  and stifling growth and innovation  as president  i will ensure that the financial rescue plan congress passed helps stop foreclosures and protects your money instead of enriching ceos  and i will put in place the common sense regulations i've been calling for throughout this campaign so that wall street can never cause a crisis like this again  that's the change we need  the choice in this election isn't between tax cuts and no tax cuts  it's about whether you believe we should only reward wealth  or whether we should also reward the work and workers who create it  i will give a tax break to   of americans who work every day and get taxes taken out of their paychecks every week  i'll eliminate income taxes for seniors making under   and give homeowners and working parents more of a break  and i'll help pay for this by asking the folks who are making more than   a year to go back to the tax rate they were paying in the  s  no matter what senator mccain may claim  here are the facts   if you make under   you will not see your taxes increase by a single dime   not your income taxes  not your payroll taxes  not your capital gains taxes  nothing  because the last thing we should do in this economy is raise taxes on the middle class  when it comes to jobs  the choice in this election is not between putting up a wall around america or standing by and doing nothing  the truth is  we won't be able to bring back every job that we've lost  but that doesn't mean we should follow john mccain's plan to keep giving tax breaks to corporations that send american jobs overseas and promoting unfair trade agreements  i will end those breaks as president  and i will give american businesses a   tax credit for every job they create right here in the united states of america  i'll eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start up companies that are the engine of job creation in this country  we'll create two million new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads  and bridges  and schools  and by laying broadband lines to reach every corner of the country  and i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new energy jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and a new electricity grid  jobs that will help us eliminate the oil we import from the middle east in ten years and help save the planet in the bargain  that's how america can lead again  when it comes to health care  we don't have to choose between a government run health care system and the unaffordable one we have now  if you already have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  if you don't have health insurance you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  and as someone who watched his own mother spend the final months of her life arguing with insurance companies because they claimed her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care most  when it comes to giving every child a world class education  the choice is not between more money and more reform   because our schools need both  as president  i will invest in early childhood education  recruit an army of new teachers  pay them more  and give them more support  but i will also demand higher standards and more accountability from our teachers and our schools  and i will make a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  and when it comes to keeping this country safe  we don't have to choose between retreating from the world and fighting a war without end in iraq  it's time to stop spending   billion a month in iraq while the iraqi government sits on a huge surplus  as president  i will end this war by asking the iraqi government to step up  and i will finally finish the fight against bin laden and the al qaeda terrorists who attacked us on   i will never hesitate to defend this nation  from day one of this campaign  i have made clear that we will increase our ground troops and our investments in the finest fighting force the world has ever known  watching our soldiers  sailors  airmen and marines fight in iraq and afghanistan has only deepened my commitment to invest in  st century technologies so that our men and women have the best training and equipment when they deploy into combat and the care and benefits they have earned when they come home  i won't stand here and pretend that any of this will be easy   especially now  the cost of this economic crisis  and the cost of the war in iraq  means that washington will have to tighten its belt and put off spending on things we don't need  as president  i will go through the federal budget  line by line  ending programs that we don't need and making the ones we do need work better and cost less  but as i've said from the day we began this journey all those months ago  the change we need isn't just about new programs and policies  it's about a new politics   a politics that calls on our better angels instead of encouraging our worst instincts  what we have lost in these last eight years cannot be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits alone  what has also been lost is the idea that in this american story  each of us has a role to play  each of us has a responsibility to work hard and look after ourselves and our families  and each of us has a responsibility to our fellow citizens  and that's what we need to restore right now   our sense of common purpose  of higher purpose  yes  government must lead the way on energy independence  but each of us must do our part to make our homes and our businesses more efficient  yes  we must put more money into our schools  but government can't be that parent who turns off the tv and makes a child do their homework  yes  we can argue and debate our positions passionately  but all of us must summon the strength and grace to bridge our differences and unite in common effort   black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  democrat and republican  young and old  rich and poor  gay and straight  disabled or not  in this election  we cannot afford the same political games and tactics that are being used to pit us against one another and make us afraid of one another  despite what our opponents may claim  there are no real or fake parts of this country  there is no city or town that is more pro america than anywhere else   we are one nation  all of us proud  all of us patriots  the men and women who serve on our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents  but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag  they have not served a red america or a blue america   they have served the united states of america  it won't be easy  iowa  it won't be quick  but you and i know that it is time to come together and change this country  some of you may be cynical and fed up with politics  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what has been asked of americans throughout our history  i ask you to believe   not just in my ability to bring about change  but in yours  i know this change is possible  because i have seen it over the last twenty one months  because in this campaign  i have had the privilege to witness what is best in america  i've seen it in lines of voters that stretched around schools and churches  in the young people who cast their ballot for the first time  and those not so young folks who got involved again after a very long time  i've seen it in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see their friends lose their jobs  in the neighbors who take a stranger in when the floodwaters rise  in the soldiers who re enlist after losing a limb  i've seen it in the faces of the men and women i've met at countless rallies and town halls across the country  men and women who speak of their struggles but also of their hopes and dreams  i still remember the email that a woman named robyn sent me after i met her in ft  lauderdale  sometime after our event  her son nearly went into cardiac arrest  and was diagnosed with a heart condition that could only be treated with a procedure that cost tens of thousands of dollars  her insurance company refused to pay  and their family just didn't have that kind of money  in her email  robyn wrote   i ask only this of you   on the days where you feel so tired you can't think of uttering another word to the people  think of us  when those who oppose you have you down  reach deep and fight back harder  iowa  that's what hope is   that thing inside us that insists  despite all evidence to the contrary  that there are better days ahead  if we're willing to work for it  if we're willing to shed our fears  if we're willing to reach deep down inside ourselves when we're tired and come back fighting harder  that's what kept some of our parents and grandparents going when times were tough  what led them to say   maybe i can't go to college  but if i save a little bit each week my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but if i work really hard my child can open one of her own  it's what led immigrants from distant lands to come to these shores against great odds  what led those who couldn't vote to march and organize and stand for freedom  that led them to cry out   it may look dark tonight  but if i hold on to hope  tomorrow will be brighter  that's what this election is about  that is the choice we face right now  don't believe for a second this election is over  don't think for a minute that power concedes  we have to work like our future depends on it in this last week  because it does  i know this  iowa   the time for change has come  and if in this last week  you will knock on some doors for me  and make some calls for me  and go to barackobama com and find out where to vote   and remember  you can vote early here in iowa  if you will stand with me  and fight by my side  and cast your ballot for me  then i promise you this   we will not just win iowa  we will not just win this election  but together  we will change this country and we will change the world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "], ["obama1", "ohio  i have just two words for you  two days  after decades of broken politics in washington  eight years of failed policies from george bush  and twenty one months of a campaign that has taken us from the rocky coast of maine to the sunshine of california  we are two days away from change in america  in two days  you can turn the page on policies that have put the greed and irresponsibility of wall street before the hard work and sacrifice of folks on main street  in two days  you can choose policies that invest in our middle class  create new jobs  and grow this economy so that everyone has a chance to succeed  from the ceo to the secretary and the janitor  from the factory owner to the men and women who work on its floor  in two days  you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election  that tries to pit region against region  city against town  republican against democrat  that asks us to fear at a time when we need hope  in two days  at this defining moment in history  you can give this country the change we need  we began this journey in the depths of winter nearly two years ago  on the steps of the old state capitol in springfield  illinois  back then  we didn't have much money or many endorsements  we weren't given much of a chance by the polls or the pundits  we knew how steep our climb would be  but i also knew this  i knew that the size of our challenges had outgrown the smallness of our politics  i believed that democrats and republicans and americans of every political stripe were hungry for new ideas  new leadership  and a new kind of politics   one that favors common sense over ideology  one that focuses on those values and ideals we hold in common as americans  most of all  i knew the american people were a decent  generous people willing to work hard and sacrifice for future generations  i was convinced that when we come together  our voices are more powerful than the most entrenched lobbyists  or the most vicious political attacks  or the full force of a status quo in washington that wants to keep things just the way they are  twenty one months later  my faith in the american people has been vindicated  that's how we've come so far and so close   because of you  that's how we'll change this country   with your help  and that's why we can't afford to slow down  sit back  or let up for one day  one minute  or one second in these last few days  not now  not when so much is at stake  we are in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the great depression    workers have lost their jobs this year  businesses and families can't get credit  home values are falling  pensions are disappearing  it's gotten harder and harder to make the mortgage  or fill up your gas tank  or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month  at a moment like this  the last thing we can afford is four more years of the tired  old theory that says we should give more to billionaires and big corporations and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else  the last thing we can afford is four more years where no one in washington is watching anyone on wall street because politicians and lobbyists killed common sense regulations  those are the theories that got us into this mess  they haven't worked  and it's time for change  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  now  senator mccain has served this country honorably  and he can point to a few moments over the past eight years where he has broken from george bush  but when it comes to the economy   when it comes to the central issue of this election   the plain truth is that john mccain has stood with this president every step of the way  voting for the bush tax cuts for the wealthy that he once opposed  voting for the bush budgets that spent us into debt  calling for less regulation twenty one times just this year  those are the facts  after twenty one months and three debates  senator mccain still has not been able to tell the american people a single major thing he'd do differently from george bush when it comes to the economy  when john mccain wants to give a   tax cut to the average fortune   ceo  that's not change  it's not change when he wants to give   billion to the biggest corporations or   billion to the oil companies or   billion to the same wall street banks that got us into this mess  it's not change when he comes up with a tax plan that doesn't give a penny of relief to more than   million middle class americans  president bush is sitting out the last few days before the election  but yesterday  dick cheney came out of his undisclosed location and hit the campaign trail  he said that he is  and i quote   delighted to support john mccain  i'd like to congratulate senator mccain on this endorsement because he really earned it  that endorsement didn't come easy  senator mccain had to vote   percent of the time with george bush and dick cheney to get it  he served as washington's biggest cheerleader for going to war in iraq  and supports economic policies that are no different from the last eight years  so senator mccain worked hard to get dick cheney's support  but here's my question for you  ohio  do you think dick cheney is delighted to support john mccain because he thinks john mccain's going to bring change  do you think john mccain and dick cheney have been talking about how to shake things up  and get rid of the lobbyists and the old boys club in washington  ohio  we know better  after all  it was just a week ago that senator mccain said that he and president bush share a  common philosophy  and we know that when it comes to foreign policy  john mccain and dick cheney share a common philosophy that thinks that empty bluster from washington will fix all of our problems  and a war without end in iraq is the way to defeat osama bin laden and the al qaeda terrorists who are in afghanistan and pakistan  so george bush may be in an undisclosed location  but dick cheney's out there on the campaign trail because he'd be delighted to pass the baton to john mccain  he knows that with john mccain you get a twofer  george bush's economic policy and dick cheney's foreign policy   but that's a risk we cannot afford to take  it's time for change  and that's why i'm running for president of the united states  we've tried it john mccain's way  we've tried it george bush and dick cheney's way  deep down  senator mccain knows that  which is why his campaign said that  if we keep talking about the economy  we're going to lose  that's why i'm talking about the economy  that's why he's spent these last weeks calling me every name in the book  because that's how you play the game in washington  when you can't win on the strength of your ideas  you make a big election about small things  so i expect we're going to see a lot more of that over the next few days  more of the slash and burn  say anything  do anything politics that's calculated to divide and distract  to tear us apart instead of bringing us together  well  that's not the kind of politics the american people need right now  ohio  at this moment  in this election  we have the chance to do more than just beat back this kind of politics in the short term  we can end it once and for all  we can prove that the one thing more powerful than the politics of anything goes is the will and determination of the american people  we can change this country  yes we can  we can prove that we are not as divided as our politics would suggest  that we are more than a collection of red states and blue states   we are the united states of america  we can steer ourselves out of this crisis   with a new politics for a new time  we can build the future we know is possible   as one people  as one nation  that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america  ohio  i know these are difficult times  but i also know that we have faced difficult times before  the american story has never been about things coming easy   it's been about rising to the moment when the moment was hard  it's about rejecting fear and division for unity of purpose  that's how we've overcome war and depression  that's how we've won great struggles for civil rights and women's rights and workers' rights  and that's how we'll write the next great chapter in the american story  understand  if we want to meet the challenges of this moment  we need to get beyond the old ideological debates and divides between left and right  we don't need bigger government or smaller government  we need a better government   a more competent government   a government that upholds the values we hold in common as americans  the choice in this election isn't between tax cuts and no tax cuts  it's about whether you believe we should only reward wealth  or whether we should also reward the work and workers who create it  i will give a tax break to   of americans who work every day and get taxes taken out of their paychecks every week  and i'll help pay for this by asking the folks who are making more than   a year to go back to the tax rate they were paying in the  s  no matter what senator mccain may claim  here are the facts   if you make under   you will not see your taxes increase by a single dime   not your income taxes  not your payroll taxes  not your capital gains taxes  nothing  because the last thing we should do in this economy is raise taxes on the middle class  when it comes to jobs  the choice in this election is not between putting up a wall around america or standing by and doing nothing  the truth is  we won't be able to bring back every job that we've lost  but that doesn't mean we should follow john mccain's plan to keep giving tax breaks to corporations that send american jobs overseas and promoting unfair trade agreements  i will end those breaks as president  and give them to companies that create jobs here in the united states of america  we'll create two million new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads  and bridges  and schools  and i will invest   billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new energy jobs over the next decade   jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced  when it comes to health care  we don't have to choose between a government run health care system and the unaffordable one we have now  if you already have health insurance  the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums  if you don't have health insurance you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves  and as someone who watched his own mother spend the final months of her life arguing with insurance companies because they claimed her cancer was a pre existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment  i will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care most  that's the change we need  that's why i'm running for president of the united states  when it comes to giving every child a world class education  the choice is not between more money and more reform   because our schools need both  as president  i will recruit an army of new teachers  pay them more  and give them more support  but i will also demand higher standards and more accountability from our teachers and our schools  and i will make a deal with every american who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college  if you commit to serving your community or your country  we will make sure you can afford your tuition  and when it comes to keeping this country safe  we don't have to choose between retreating from the world and fighting a war without end in iraq  it's time to stop spending   billion a month in iraq while the iraqi government sits on a huge surplus  as president  i will end this war  i will ask the iraqi government to step up for their future  and i will finally finish the fight against bin laden and the al qaeda terrorists who attacked us on   i will never hesitate to defend this nation  and i will make sure our servicemen and women have the best training and equipment when they deploy into combat  and the care and benefits they have earned when they come home  that's what we owe our veterans  that's what i'll do as president  i won't stand here and pretend that any of this will be easy   especially now  the cost of this economic crisis  and the cost of the

 as president  i will end this war  i will ask the iraqi government to step up for their future  and i will finally finish the fight against bin laden and the al qaeda terrorists who attacked us on   i will never hesitate to defend this nation  and i will make sure our servicemen and women have the best training and equipment when they deploy into combat  and the care and benefits they have earned when they come home  that's what we owe our veterans  that's what i'll do as president  i won't stand here and pretend that any of this will be easy   especially now  the cost of this economic crisis  and the cost of the war in iraq  means that washington will have to tighten its belt and put off spending on things we don't need  as president  i will go through the federal budget  line by line  ending programs that we don't need and making the ones we do need work better and cost less  but as i've said from the day we began this journey  the change we need won't come from government alone  it will come from each of us doing our part in our own lives and our own communities  it will come from each of us looking after ourselves  our families  and our fellow citizens  yes  government must lead the way on energy independence  but each of us must do our part to make our homes and our businesses more efficient  yes  we must put more money into our schools  but government can't be that parent who turns off the tv and makes a child do their homework  we need a return to responsibility and a return to civility  yes  we can argue and debate our positions passionately  but all of us must summon the strength and grace to bridge our differences and unite in common effort   black  white  hispanic  asian  native american  democrat and republican  young and old  rich and poor  gay and straight  disabled or not  in this election  we cannot afford the same political games and tactics that are being used to pit us against one another and make us afraid of one another  despite what our opponents may claim  there are no real or fake parts of this country  there is no city or town that is more pro america than anywhere else   we are one nation  all of us proud  all of us patriots  the men and women who serve on our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents  but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag  they have not served a red america or a blue america   they have served the united states of america  it won't be easy  florida  it won't be quick  but you and i know that it is time to come together and change this country  some of you may be cynical and fed up with politics  you have every right to be  but despite all of this  i ask of you what has been asked of americans throughout our history  i ask you to believe   not just in my ability to bring about change  but in yours  i know this change is possible  because i have seen it over the last twenty one months  because in this campaign  i have had the privilege to witness what is best in america  i've seen it in the faces of the men and women i've met at countless rallies and town halls across the country  men and women who speak of their struggles but also of their hopes and dreams  i still remember the email that a woman named robyn sent me after i met her in ft  lauderdale  sometime after our event  her son nearly went into cardiac arrest  and was diagnosed with a heart condition that could only be treated with a procedure that cost tens of thousands of dollars  her insurance company refused to pay  and their family just didn't have that kind of money  in her email  robyn wrote   i ask only this of you   on the days where you feel so tired you can't think of uttering another word to the people  think of us  when those who oppose you have you down  reach deep and fight back harder  florida  that's what hope is  that's what kept some of our parents and grandparents going when times were tough  what led them to say   maybe i can't go to college  but if i save a little bit each week  my child can  maybe i can't have my own business but if i work really hard my child can open up one of her own  it's what led those who could not vote to say  if i march and organize  maybe my child or grandchild can run for president someday  that's what hope is   that thing inside that insists  despite all evidence to the contrary  that there are better days ahead  if we're willing to work for it  if we're willing to shed our fears  if we're willing to reach deep inside ourselves when we're tired  and come back fighting harder  don't believe for a second this election is over  don't think for a minute that power concedes  we have to work like our future depends on it in the next twenty four hours  because it does  but i know this  florida  the time for change has come  we have a righteous wind at our back  and if in these final hours  you will knock on some doors for me  and make some calls for me  and go to barackobama com and find out where to vote  if you will stand with me  and fight by my side  and cast your ballot for me  then i promise you this   we will not just win florida  we will not just win this election  but together  we will change this country and we will change the world  thank you  god bless you  and may god bless america "]]
